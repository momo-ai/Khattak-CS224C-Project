0,in the spring of 2018 facebook coo sheryl sandberg told the world that we “would be a lot better off if half of all countries and companies were run by women and half of all homes were run by men” and that “we shouldn’t be satisfied until we reach that goal” a leading exponent of corporate feminism sandberg had already made a name and a buck for herself by urging women managers to “lean in” at the company boardroom
1,as former chief of staff to us treasury secretary larry summersthe man who deregulated wall streetshe had no qualms about counseling women that success won through toughness in the business world was the royal road to gender equality
2,that same spring a militant feminist strike shut down spain
3,joined by more than 5 million marchers organizers of the twentyfourhour huelga feminista called for “a society free of sexist oppression exploitation and violence  for rebellion and a struggle against the alliance of the patriarchy and capitalism that wants us to be obedient submissive and quiet” as the sun set over madrid and barcelona the feminist strikers announced to the world “on march 8 we cross our arms interrupting all productive and reproductive activity” declaring they would not “accept worse working conditions nor being paid less than men for the same work” these two voices represent opposing paths for the feminist movement
4,on the one hand sandberg and her ilk see feminism as a handmaiden of capitalism
5,they want a world where the task of managing exploitation in the workplace and oppression in the social whole is shared equally by rulingclass men and women
6,this is a remarkable vision of equal opportunity domination one that asks ordinary people in the name of feminism to be grateful that it is a woman not a man who busts their union orders a drone to kill their parent or locks their child in a cage at the border
7,in sharp contrast to sandberg’s liberal feminism the organizers of the huelga feminista insist on ending capitalism the system that generates the boss produces national borders and manufactures the drones that guard them
8,faced with these two visions of feminism we find ourselves at a fork in the road and our choice bears extraordinary consequences for humankind
9,one path leads to a scorched planet where human life is immiserated to the point of unrecognizability if indeed it remains possible at all
10,the other points to the sort of world that has always figured centrally in humanity’s most exalted dreams a just world whose wealth and natural resources are shared by all and where equality and freedom are premises not aspirations
11,the contrast could not be starker
12,but what makes the choice pressing for us now is the absence of any viable middle way
13,we owe the dearth of alternatives to neoliberalism that exceptionally predatory financialized form of capitalism that has held sway across the globe for the last forty years
14,having poisoned the atmosphere mocked every pretense of democratic rule stretched our social capacities to their breaking point and worsened living conditions generally for the vast majority this iteration of capitalism has raised the stakes for every social struggle transforming sober efforts to win modest reforms into pitched battles for survival
15,under such conditions the time for fencesitting is past and feminists must take a stand will we continue to pursue “equal opportunity domination” while the planet burns
16,or will we reimagine gender justice in an anticapitalist formone that leads beyond the present crisis to a new society
17,this manifesto is a brief for the second path a course we deem both necessary and feasible
18,an anticapitalist feminism has become thinkable today in part because the credibility of political elites is collapsing worldwide
19,the casualties include not only the centerleft and centerright parties that promoted neoliberalismnow despised remnants of their former selvesbut also their sandbergstyle corporate feminist allies whose “progressive” veneer has lost its shine
20,liberal feminism met its waterloo in the us presidential election of 2016 when the muchballyhooed candidacy of hillary clinton failed to excite women voters
21,and for good reason clinton personified the deepening disconnect between elite women’s ascension to high office and improvements in the lives of the vast majority
22,clinton’s defeat is our wakeup call
23,exposing the bankruptcy of liberal feminism it has created an opening for a challenge to it from the left
24,in the vacuum produced by liberalism’s decline we have a chance to build another feminism a feminism with a different definition of what counts as a feminist issue a different class orientation and a different ethosone that is radical and transformative
25,this manifesto is our effort to promote that “other” feminism
26,we write not to sketch an imagined utopia but to mark out the road that must be traveled to reach a just society
27,we aim to explain why feminists should choose the road of feminist strikes why we must unite with other anticapitalist and antisystemic movements and why our movement must become a feminism for the 99 percent
28,only in this wayby connecting with antiracists environmentalists and labor and migrant rights activistscan feminism rise to the challenge of our times
29,by decisively rejecting “lean in” dogma and the feminism of the 1 percent our feminism can become a beacon of hope for everyone else
30,what gives us the courage to embark on this project now is the new wave of militant feminist activism
31,this is not the corporate feminism that has proved so disastrous for working women and is now hemorrhaging credibility nor is it the “microcredit feminism” that claims to “empower” women of the global south by lending them tiny sums of money
32,rather what give us hope are the international feminist and women’s strikes of 2017 and 2018 it is these strikes and the increasingly coordinated movements that are developing around them that first inspiredand now embodya feminism for the 99 percent
33,the recent feminist strike movement began in poland in october of 2016 when more than 100000 women staged walkouts and marches to oppose the country’s ban on abortion
34,by the end of the month an upwelling of radical refusal had already crossed the ocean to argentina where striking women met the heinous murder of lucía pérez with the militant cry “ni una menos” soon it spread to italy spain brazil turkey peru the united states mexico chile and dozens of other countries
35,from its origins in the streets the movement then surged through workplaces and schools eventually engulfing the highflying worlds of show business media and politics
36,for the last two years its slogans have resonated powerfully across the globe nosotrasparamos westrike vivasnosqueremos niunamenos timesup feminism4the99
37,at first a ripple then a wave it has become a massive tide a new global feminist movement that may gain sufficient force to disrupt existing alliances and redraw the political map
38,what had been a series of nationally based actions became a transnational movement on march 8 2017 when organizers around the globe decided to strike together
39,with this bold stroke they repoliticized international women’s day
40,brushing aside the tacky baubles of depoliticizationbrunches mimosas and hallmark cardsthe strikers have revived the day’s allbutforgotten historical roots in workingclass and socialist feminism
41,their actions evoke the spirit of early twentieth century working class women’s mobilizationparadigmatically the strikes and mass demonstrations led mostly by immigrant and jewish women in the united states which inspired us socialists to organize the first national women’s day and german socialists luise zietz and clara zetkin to call for an international working women’s day
42,reanimating that militant spirit the feminist strikes of today are reclaiming our roots in historic struggles for workers’ rights and social justice
43,uniting women separated by oceans mountains and continents as well as by borders barbed wire fences and walls they give new meaning to the slogan “solidarity is our weapon” breaking through the isolation of domestic and symbolic walls the strikes demonstrate the enormous political potential of women’s power the power of those whose paid and unpaid work sustains the world
44,but that is not all this burgeoning movement has invented new ways to strike and infused the strike form itself with a new kind of politics
45,by coupling the withdrawal of labor with marches demonstrations small business closures blockades and boycotts the movement is replenishing the repertoire of strike actions once large but dramatically shrunk by a decadeslong neoliberal offensive
46,at the same time this new wave is democratizing strikes and expanding their scopeabove all by broadening the very idea of what counts as “labor” refusing to limit that category to waged work women’s strike activism is also withdrawing housework sex and smiles
47,by making visible the indispensable role played by gendered unpaid work in capitalist society it draws attention to activities from which capital benefits but for which it does not pay
48,and with respect to paid work too the strikers take an expansive view of what counts as a labor issue
49,far from focusing only on wages and hours they are also targeting sexual harassment and assault barriers to reproductive justice and curbs on the right to strike
50,as a result the new feminist wave has the potential to overcome the stubborn and divisive opposition between “identity politics” and “class politics” disclosing the unity of “workplace” and “private life” it refuses to limit its struggles to those spaces
51,and by redefining what counts as “work” and who counts as a “worker” it rejects capitalism’s structural undervaluation of women’s laborboth paid and unpaid
52,all told women’s strike feminism anticipates the possibility of a new unprecedented phase of class struggle feminist internationalist environmentalist and antiracist
53,this intervention is perfectly timed
54,women’s strike militancy has erupted at a moment when oncepowerful trade unions centered in manufacturing have been severely weakened
55,to reinvigorate class struggle activists have turned to another arena the neoliberal assault on health care education pensions and housing
56,in targeting this other prong of capital’s fourdecade attack on workingand middleclass living conditions they have trained their sights on the labor and services that are needed to sustain human beings and social communities
57,it is here in the sphere of “social reproduction” that we now find many of the most militant strikes and fightbacks
58,from the strike wave of teachers in the united states to the struggle against water privatization in ireland to the strikes of dalit sanitation workers in indiaall led and powered by womenworkers are revolting against capital’s assault on social reproduction
59,although not formally affiliated with the international women’s strike movement these strikes have much in common with it
60,they too valorize the work that is necessary to reproduce our lives while opposing its exploitation and they too combine wage and workplace demands with demands for increased public spending on social services
61,in countries such as argentina spain and italy moreover women’s strike feminism has attracted broad support from forces opposing austerity
62,not only women and gendernonconforming people but also men have joined the movement’s massive demonstrations against the defunding of schools health care housing transport and environmental protections
63,through their opposition to finance capital’s assault on these “public goods” feminist strikes are thus becoming the catalyst and model for broadbased efforts to defend our communities
64,all told the new wave of militant feminist activism is rediscovering the idea of the impossible demanding both bread and roses the bread that decades of neoliberalism have taken from our tables but also the beauty that nourishes our spirit through the exhilaration of rebellion
65,the mainstream media continues to equate feminism as such with liberal feminism
66,but far from providing the solution liberal feminism is part of the problem
67,centered in the global north among the professionalmanagerial stratum it is focused on “leaningin” and “cracking the glass ceiling” dedicated to enabling a smattering of privileged women to climb the corporate ladder and the ranks of the military it propounds a marketcentered view of equality that dovetails perfectly with the prevailing corporate enthusiasm for “diversity” although it condemns “discrimination” and advocates “freedom of choice” liberal feminism steadfastly refuses to address the socioeconomic constraints that make freedom and empowerment impossible for the large majority of women
68,its real aim is not equality but meritocracy
69,rather than seeking to abolish social hierarchy it aims to “diversify” it “empowering” “talented” women to rise to the top
70,in treating women simply as an “underrepresented group” its proponents seek to ensure that a few privileged souls can attain positions and pay on a par with the men of their own class
71,by definition the principal beneficiaries are those who already possess considerable social cultural and economic advantages
72,everyone else remains stuck in the basement
73,fully compatible with ballooning inequality liberal feminism outsources oppression
74,it permits professionalmanagerial women to lean in precisely by enabling them to lean on the poorly paid migrant women to whom they subcontract their caregiving and housework
75,insensitive to class and race it links our cause with elitism and individualism
76,projecting feminism as a “standalone” movement it associates us with policies that harm the majority and cuts us off from struggles that oppose those policies
77,in short liberal feminism gives feminism a bad name
78,liberal feminism’s ethos converges not only with corporate mores but also with supposedly “transgressive” currents of neoliberal culture
79,its love affair with individual advancement equally permeates the world of socialmedia celebrity which also confuses feminism with the ascent of individual women
80,in that world “feminism” risks becoming a trending hashtag and a vehicle of selfpromotion deployed less to liberate the many than to elevate the few
81,in general then liberal feminism supplies the perfect alibi for neoliberalism
82,cloaking regressive policies in an aura of emancipation it enables the forces supporting global capital to portray themselves as “progressive” allied with global finance in the united states while providing cover for islamophobia in europe this is the feminism of the female powerholders the corporate gurus who preach “lean in” the femocrats who push structural adjustment and microcredit on the global south and the professional politicians in pant suits who collect sixfigure fees for speeches to wall street
83,our answer to leanin feminism is kickback feminism
84,we have no interest in breaking the glass ceiling while leaving the vast majority to clean up the shards
85,far from celebrating women ceos who occupy corner offices we want to get rid of ceos and corner offices
86,the feminism we have in mind recognizes that it must respond to a crisis of epochal proportions plummeting living standards and looming ecological disaster rampaging wars and intensified dispossession mass migrations met with barbed wire emboldened racism and xenophobia and the reversal of hardwon rightsboth social and political
87,we aspire to meet these challenges
88,eschewing halfmeasures the feminism we envision aims to tackle the capitalist roots of metastasizing barbarism
89,refusing to sacrifice the wellbeing of the many in order to protect the freedom of the few it champions the needs and rights of the manyof poor and workingclass women of racialized and migrant women of queer trans and disabled women of women encouraged to see themselves as “middle class” even as capital exploits them
90,but that is not all
91,this feminism does not limit itself to “women’s issues” as they are traditionally defined
92,standing for all who are exploited dominated and oppressed it aims to become a source of hope for the whole of humanity
93,that is why we call it a feminism for the 99 percent
94,inspired by the new wave of women’s strikes feminism for the 99 percent is emerging from the crucible of practical experience as informed by theoretical reflection
95,as neoliberalism reshapes gender oppression before our eyes we see that the only way that women and gender nonconforming people can actualize the rights they have on paper or might still win is by transforming the underlying social system that hollows out rights
96,by itself legal abortion does little for poor and workingclass women who have neither the means to pay for it nor access to clinics that provide it
97,rather reproductive justice requires free universal notforprofit health care as well as the end of racist eugenicist practices in the medical profession
98,likewise for poor and workingclass women wage equality can mean only equality in misery unless it comes with jobs that pay a generous living wage with substantive actionable labor rights and with a new organization of house and carework
99,then too laws criminalizing gender violence are a cruel hoax if they turn a blind eye to the structural sexism and racism of criminal justice systems leaving intact police brutality mass incarceration deportation threats military interventions and harassment and abuse in the workplace
100,finally legal emancipation remains an empty shell if it does not include public services social housing and funding to ensure that women can leave domestic and workplace violence
101,in these ways and more feminism for the 99 percent seeks profound farreaching social transformation
102,that in a nutshell is why it cannot be a separatist movement
103,we propose rather to join with every movement that fights for the 99 percent whether by struggling for environmental justice free highquality education generous public services lowcost housing labor rights free universal health care or a world without racism or war
104,it is only by allying with such movements that we gain the power and vision to dismantle the social relations and the institutions that oppress us
105,feminism for the 99 percent embraces class struggle and the fight against institutional racism
106,it centers the concerns of workingclass women of all stripes whether racialized migrant or white cis trans or gender nonconforming housewives or sex workers paid by the hour the week the month or not at all unemployed or precarious young or old
107,staunchly internationalist it is firmly opposed to imperialism and war
108,feminism for the 99 percent is not only antineoliberal but also anticapitalist
109,for mainstream observers 2007–2008 marked the beginning of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s
110,although correct as far as it goes that understanding of the present crisis is still too narrow
111,what we are living through is a crisis of society as a whole
112,by no means restricted to the precincts of finance it is simultaneously a crisis of economy ecology politics and “care” a general crisis of an entire form of social organization it is at bottom a crisis of capitalismand in particular of the viciously predatory form of capitalism we inhabit today globalizing financialized neoliberal
113,capitalism generates such crises periodicallyand for reasons that are not accidental
114,not only does this system live by exploiting wage labor it also freerides on nature public goods and the unwaged work that reproduces human beings and communities
115,driven by relentless pursuit of unlimited profit capital expands by helping itself to all of those things without paying for their replacement except where it is forced to do so
116,primed by its very logic to degrade nature instrumentalize public powers and commandeer unwaged carework capital periodically destabilizes the very conditions that itand the rest of usrely upon to survive
117,crisis is hardwired into its dna
118,today’s crisis of capitalism is especially severe
119,four decades of neoliberalism have driven down wages weakened labor rights ravaged the environment and usurped the energies available to sustain families and communitiesall while spreading the tentacles of finance across the social fabric
120,no wonder then that masses of people throughout the world are now saying “basta” open to thinking outside the box they are rejecting established political parties and neoliberal commonsense about “free market competition” “trickledown economics” “labor market flexibility” and “unsustainable debt” the result is a gaping vacuum of leadership and organizationand a growing sense that something must give
121,feminism for the 99 percent is among the social forces that have leapt into this breach
122,we do not however command the terrain
123,rather we share the stage with many bad actors
124,upstart rightwing movements everywhere promise to improve the lot of families of “the right” ethnicity nationality and religion by ending “free trade” curtailing immigration and restricting the rights of women people of color and lgbtq people
125,meanwhile on the other side dominant currents of “the progressive resistance” advance an equally unsavory agenda
126,in their efforts to restore the status quo ante partisans of global finance hope to convince feminists antiracists and environmentalists to close ranks with their liberal “protectors” and to forego more ambitious egalitarian projects of social transformation
127,feminists for the 99 percent decline that proposal
128,rejecting not only reactionary populism but also its progressive neoliberal opponents we intend to identify and confront head on the real source of crisis and misery which is capitalism
129,for us in other words a crisis is not simply a time of sufferingstill less a mere impasse in profitmaking
130,crucially it is also a moment of political awakening and an opportunity for social transformation
131,in times of crisis critical masses of people withdraw their support from the powers that be
132,rejecting politics as usual they begin to search for new ideas organizations and alliances
133,in such situations the burning questions are who will guide the process of societal transformation in whose interest and to what end
134,this type of process whereby general crisis leads to societal reorganization has played out several times in modern historylargely to capital’s benefit
135,seeking to restore profitability its champions have reinvented capitalism time and againreconfiguring not only the official economy but also politics social reproduction and our relation to nonhuman nature
136,in so doing they have reorganized not only class exploitation but also gender and racial oppression often appropriating rebellious energies including feminist energies for projects that overwhelmingly benefit the 1 percent
137,will this process be repeated today
138,historically the 1 percent have always been indifferent to the interests of society or the majority
139,but today they are especially dangerous
140,in their singleminded pursuit of shortterm profits they fail to gauge not only the depth of the crisis but also the threat it poses to the longterm health of the capitalist system itself they would rather drill for oil now than ensure the ecological preconditions for their own future profits
141,as a result the crisis we confront threatens life as we know it
142,the struggle to resolve it poses the most fundamental questions of social organization where will we draw the line delimiting economy from society society from nature production from reproduction and work from family
143,how will we use the social surplus we collectively produce
144,and who exactly will decide these matters
145,will profitmakers manage to turn capitalism’s social contradictions into new opportunities for accumulating private wealth
146,will they coopt important strands of feminist rebellion even as they reorganize gender hierarchy
147,or will a mass uprising against capital finally be “the act by which the human race travelling in the runaway train applies the emergency brake”
148,and if so will feminists be at the forefront of that uprising
149,if we have any say in this matter the answer to the last question will be yes
150,many people know that capitalist societies are by definition class societies which license a small minority to accumulate private profits by exploiting the much larger group who must work for wages
151,what is less widely understood is that capitalist societies are also by definition wellsprings of gender oppression
152,far from being accidental sexism is hardwired into their very structure
153,certainly capitalism did not invent the subordination of women
154,the latter existed in various forms in all previous class societies
155,but capitalism established new distinctively “modern” forms of sexism underpinned by new institutional structures
156,its key move was to separate the making of people from the making of profit to assign the first job to women and to subordinate it to the second
157,with this stroke capitalism simultaneously reinvented women’s oppression and turned the whole world upside down
158,the perversity becomes clear when we recall how vital and complex the work of peoplemaking actually is
159,not only does this activity create and sustain life in the biological sense it also creates and sustains our capacity to workor what marx called our “labor power” and that means fashioning people with the “right” attitudes dispositions and valuesabilities competences and skills
160,all told peoplemaking work supplies some fundamental preconditionsmaterial social culturalfor human society in general and for capitalist production in particular
161,without it neither life nor labor power could be embodied in human beings
162,we call this vast body of vital activity social reproduction
163,in capitalist societies the pivotally important role of social reproduction is disguised and disavowed
164,far from being valued in its own right the making of people is treated as a mere means to the making of profit
165,because capital avoids paying for this work to the extent that it can while treating money as the beall and endall it relegates those who perform socialreproductive labor to a position of subordinationnot only to the owners of capital but also to those more advantaged waged workers who can offload the responsibility for it onto others
166,those “others” are largely female
167,for in capitalist society the organization of social reproduction rests on gender it relies on gender roles and entrenches gender oppression
168,social reproduction is therefore a feminist issue
169,but it is shot through at every point by the fault lines of class race sexuality and nation
170,a feminism aimed at resolving the current crisis must understand social reproduction through a lens that also comprehends and connects all those axes of domination
171,capitalist societies have always instituted a racial division of reproductive labor
172,whether via slavery or colonialism apartheid or neoimperialism this system has coerced racialized women to provide such labor gratisor at a very low costfor their majorityethnicity or white “sisters” forced to lavish care on the children and homes of their mistresses or employers they have had to struggle all the harder to care for their own
173,historically moreover capitalist societies have sought to enlist women’s social reproductive work in the service of gender binarism and heteronormativity
174,they have encouraged mothers teachers and doctors among others to ensure that children are strictly fashioned as cisgirls or cisboys and as heterosexuals
175,then too modern states have often tried to instrumentalize the work of peoplemaking for national and imperial projects
176,incentivizing births of the “right” kind while discouraging those of the “wrong” kind they have designed education and family policies to produce not just “people” but for example “germans” “italians” or “americans” who can be called on to sacrifice for the nation when needed
177,finally the class character of social reproduction is fundamental
178,workingclass mothers and schools have been expected to prepare their kids for lives as proper “workers” obedient deferential to bosses and primed to accept “their station” and tolerate exploitation
179,these pressures have never worked perfectly and even misfired spectacularly on occasion
180,and some of them are lessening today
181,but social reproduction is deeply entangled with dominationand with the struggle against it
182,once we understand the centrality of social reproduction in capitalist society we can no longer view class in the usual way
183,contra oldschool understandings what makes class in capitalist society are not just relations that directly exploit “labor” but also relations that produce and replenish it
184,nor is the global working class comprised exclusively of those who work for wages in factories or mines
185,equally central are those who work in the fields and in private homes in offices hotels and restaurants in hospitals nurseries and schools in the public sector and in civil societythe precariat the unemployed and those who receive no pay in return for their work
186,far from being restricted to straight white men in whose image it is still too often imagined the bulk of the global working class is made up of migrants racialized people womenboth cis and transand people with different abilities all of whose needs and desires are negated or twisted by capitalism
187,this lens also expands our view of class struggle
188,not focused exclusively on economic gains in the workplace like fair contracts or the minimum wage it occurs at multiple sites in society and not only through unions and official workers’ organizations
189,the critical point for us and the key to understanding the present is that class struggle includes struggles over social reproduction for universal health care and free education for environmental justice and access to clean energy and for housing and public transportation
190,equally central to it are political struggles for women’s liberation against racism and xenophobia war and colonialism
191,such conflicts have always been central to capitalist society which relies on reproductive labor while disavowing its value
192,but social reproduction struggles are especially explosive today
193,as neoliberalism demands more hours of waged work per household and less state support for social welfare it squeezes families communities and above all women to the breaking point
194,under these conditions of universal expropriation struggles over social reproduction have taken center stage
195,they now form the leading edge of projects with the potential to alter society root and branch
196,researchers estimate that globally more than one in three women have experienced some form of gender violence in the course of their lifetimes
197,many of the perpetrators are intimate partners responsible for a whopping 38 percent of the murders of women
198,liable to be physical emotional sexual or all of the above intimate partner violence is found throughout capitalist societyin every nation class and racialethnic group
199,far from being accidental it is grounded in the basic institutional structure of capitalist society
200,the gender violence we experience today reflects the contradictory dynamics of family and personal life in capitalist society
201,and these in turn are based in the system’s signature division between peoplemaking and profitmaking family and “work” a key development was the shift from the extended kinbased households of an earlier timein which male elders held the power of life and death over their dependentsto the restricted heterosexual nuclear family of capitalist modernity which vested an attenuated right of rule in the “smaller” men who headed smaller households
202,with this shift the character of kinbased gender violence was transfigured
203,what was once overtly political now became “private” more informal and “psychological” less “rational” and controlled
204,often fueled by alcohol shame and anxiety about maintaining dominance this sort of gender violence is found in every period of capitalist development
205,nevertheless it becomes especially virulent and pervasive in times of crisis
206,in such times when status anxiety economic precarity and political uncertainty loom large the gender order too appears to tremble
207,some men experience women as “out of control” and modern society with its new sexual freedoms and gender fluidity as “out of joint” their wives or girlfriends are “uppity” their homes “disordered” and their children “wild” their bosses are unrelenting their coworkers unjustly favored and their jobs at risk
208,their sexual prowess and powers of seduction are in doubt
209,perceiving their masculinity to be threatened they explode
210,but not all gender violence in capitalist society takes this apparently “private” “irrational” form
211,other types are all too “rational” witness the instrumentalization of gendered assault as a technique of control
212,examples include the widespread weaponization of the rape of enslaved and colonized women to terrorize communities of color and enforce their subjugation the repeated rape of women by pimps and traffickers to “break them in” and the coordinated mass rape of “enemy” women as a weapon of war
213,often instrumental too are sexual assault and harassment in workplaces schools or clinics
214,in these cases the perpetrators are bosses and supervisors teachers and coaches policemen and prison guards doctors and shrinks landlords and army officersall with public institutional power over those on whom they prey
215,they can command sexual services and so some of them do
216,here the root is women’s economic professional political and racial vulnerability our dependence on the paycheck the reference the willingness of the employer or foreman not to ask about immigration status
217,what enables this violence is a system of hierarchical power that fuses gender race and class
218,what results from it is that system’s reinforcement and normalization
219,in fact these two forms of gender violenceone private the other publicare not so separate after all
220,there exist hybrid cases such as teenage fraternity and athletic subcultures in which young men channeling institutionalized misogyny vie with each other for status and bragging rights by abusing women
221,moreover some forms of public and private gender violence form a mutually reinforcing vicious cycle
222,because capitalism assigns reproductive work overwhelmingly to women it restricts our ability to participate fully as peers in the world of “productive work” with the result that most of us land in deadend jobs that don’t pay enough to support a family
223,that rebounds on “private” life to our disadvantage as our lesser ability to exit relationships disempowers us within them
224,the primary beneficiary of the overall arrangement is capital to be sure
225,but its effect is to render us doubly subject to violationfirst at the hands of familial and personal intimates and second at those of capital’s enforcers and enablers
226,the conventional feminist responses to gender violence are understandable but nonetheless inadequate
227,the most widespread response is the demand for criminalization and punishment
228,this “carceral feminism” as it has been called takes for granted precisely what needs to be called into question the mistaken assumption that the laws police and courts maintain sufficient autonomy from the capitalist power structure to counter its deepseated tendency to generate gender violence
229,in fact the criminal justice system disproportionately targets poor and workingclass men of color including migrants while leaving their whitecollar professional counterparts free to rape and batter it also leaves women to pick up the pieces traveling long distances to visit incarcerated sons and husbands providing for their households alone and dealing with the legal and bureaucratic fallout of imprisonment
230,likewise antitrafficking campaigns and laws against “sexual slavery” are frequently used to deport migrant women while their rapists and profiteers remain at large
231,at the same time the carceral response overlooks the importance of exit options for survivors
232,laws criminalizing marital rape or workplace assault won’t help women with nowhere else to go nor those with no way to get there
233,under such conditions no feminist with even a shred of sensitivity to class and race can endorse a carceral response to gender violence
234,equally inadequate are the “marketbased solutions” proffered by femocrats
235,from their lofty perches at global financial institutions these progressive neoliberals in skirts propose to shield their less fortunate southern sisters from violence by lending them small sums of money to start their own businesses
236,the evidence that microloans actually reduce domestic violence or promote women’s independence from men is spotty at best
237,however one effect is crystal clear microlending increases women’s dependence on their creditors
238,by tightening the noose of debt around the necks of poor and workingclass women this approach to gender violence inflicts a violence of its own
239,feminism for the 99 percent rejects both carceral and femocratic approaches to gender violence
240,we know that gender violence under capitalism is not a disruption of the regular order of things but a systemic condition
241,deeply anchored in the social order it can neither be understood nor redressed in isolation from the larger complex of capitalist violence the biopolitical violence of laws that deny reproductive freedom the economic violence of the market the bank the landlord and the loan shark the state violence of police courts and prison guards the transnational violence of border agents migration regimes and imperial armies the symbolic violence of mainstream culture that colonizes our minds distorts our bodies and silences our voices and the “slow” environmental violence that eats away at our communities and habitats
242,these dynamics while endemic to capitalism have sharply escalated during the present period of crisis
243,in the name of “individual responsibility” neoliberalism has slashed public funding for social provisions
244,in some cases it has marketized public services turning them into direct profit streams in others it has shunted them back to individual families forcing themand especially the women within themto bear the entire burden of care
245,the effect is to further encourage gender violence
246,in the united states the crash of the mortgage market disproportionately hit women of color who suffered the highest rates of eviction and were more likely to be forced to choose between homelessness and remaining in abusive relationships
247,in the uk the powers that be responded to the financial collapse by further slashing public servicesfirst and foremost funding for domestic violence shelters
248,in the caribbean an increase in food and fuel prices coincided with cuts in public funding for social services producing a rise in gender violence
249,these moves were accompanied by a proliferation of normalizing disciplinary propaganda
250,repeated admonitions to be a “good” wife or to have more children turn all too quickly into justifications for violence against those who fail to conform to normative gender roles and identities
251,today moreover antilabor laws exacerbate violence in economic sectors that rely heavily on women workers
252,in exportprocessing zones epzs such as the 3000 maquiladoras in mexico gender violence is widely deployed as a tool of labor discipline
253,bosses and managers in the factories use serial rape verbal abuse and humiliating body searches to increase productivity and discourage labor organizing
254,once entrenched in epzs it is only a matter of time before these practices are generalized through the whole of societyincluding in workingclass homes
255,in capitalist societies then gender violence is not freestanding
256,on the contrary it has deep roots within a social order that entwines women’s subordination with the gendered organization of work and the dynamics of capital accumulation
257,viewed this way it is not surprising that the metoo movement began as a protest against workplace abuse nor that the first statement of solidarity with the women in show business came from immigrant farmworkers in california they immediately recognized harvey weinstein not simply as a predator but as a powerful boss able to dictate who would be allowed to work in hollywood and who would not
258,violence in all its forms is integral to the everyday functioning of capitalist societyfor it is only through a mix of brute coercion and constructed consent that the system can sustain itself in the best of times
259,one form of violence cannot be stopped without stopping the others
260,vowing to eradicate them all feminists for the 99 percent aim to connect the struggle against gender violence to the fight against all forms of violence in capitalist societyand against the social system that undergirds them
261,at first sight today’s sexual struggles present an unambiguous choice
262,on one side stand the forces of sexual reaction on the other those of sexual liberalism
263,the reactionaries seek to outlaw sexual practices that they claim violate enduring family values or divine law
264,determined to uphold those supposedly timeless principles they would stone “adulterers” cane lesbians or subject gay people to “conversion therapy” by contrast the liberals fight for the legal rights of sexual dissidents and minorities
265,endorsing state recognition of oncetabooed relationships and despised identities they support “marriage equality” and lgbtq access to the ranks of the military
266,whereas the first side seeks to rehabilitate regressive archaismspatriarchy homophobia sexual repressionthe second stands for modernityindividual freedom selfexpression and sexual diversity
267,how could the choice be anything but a nobrainer
268,in reality though neither side is what it appears
269,on the one hand the sexual authoritarianism we encounter today is anything but archaic
270,while presented as timeless divine commands or ageold customs the prohibitions it aims to establish are in fact “neotraditional” reactive responses to capitalist development as modern as what they oppose
271,and by the same token the sexual rights promised by liberal opponents are conceived in terms that presuppose capitalist forms of modernity far from enabling real liberation they are normalizing statist and consumerist
272,to see why this is so consider the genealogy of this opposition
273,capitalist societies have always tried to regulate sexuality but the means and methods have varied historically
274,in the system’s early days before capitalist relations had been pervasively established it was left to preexisting authorities especially churches and communities to establish and enforce the norms that distinguished acceptable from sinful sex
275,later as capitalism proceeded to reshape the whole of society it incubated new bourgeois norms and modes of regulationincluding statesanctioned gender binarism and heteronormativity
276,confined neither to the capitalist metropole nor to the bourgeois classes these “modern” norms of gender and sexuality were broadly diffused including via colonialism and through mass culture and they were widely enforced by repressive and administrative state power including by familybased criteria of entitlement to social provisions
277,but they did not go unchallenged
278,on the contrary these norms collided not only with older sexual regimes but also with stillnewer aspirations for sexual freedom which found expression especially in cities in gay and lesbian subcultures and in avantgarde enclaves
279,later developments restructured that configuration
280,in the aftermath of the 1960s the bourgeois current softened while the liberationist strand overflowed the subcultures that originated it and went mainstream
281,as a result dominant factions of both those streams are increasingly united in a new project to normalize once taboo forms of sex within an expanded zone of state regulation and in a capitalfriendly guise that encourages individualism domesticity and commodity consumption
282,what lies behind this new configuration is a decisive shift in the nature of capitalism
283,increasingly financialized globalized and defamilialized capital is no longer implacably opposed to queer and noncis sexgender formations
284,nor do large corporations still insist on one and only one normative form of family or sex many of them are now willing to permit significant numbers of their employees to live outside heterosexual familiesthat is provided they toe the line both at the workplace and at the mall
285,in the marketplace too sexual dissidence finds a niche as a source of enticing advertising images product lines lifestyle commodities and prepackaged pleasures
286,sex sells in capitalist societyand neoliberalism merchandizes it in many flavors
287,today’s struggles over sexuality take the stage at a time of tremendous gender fluidity among the young and amid burgeoning queer and feminist movements
288,it is also a time of significant legal victories including formal gender equality lgbtq rights and marriage equalityall now enshrined in law in a growing list of countries throughout the world
289,these victories are the fruits of hardfought battles even as they also reflect momentous social and cultural changes associated with neoliberalism
290,nevertheless they are inherently fragile and constantly threatened
291,new legal rights do not stop the assault on lgbtq people who continue to experience gender and sexual violence symbolic misrecognition and social discrimination
292,in fact financialized capitalism is fueling a sexual backlash of major proportions
293,it is not “just” the “incels” who murder women to avenge the “theft” of female sexuality from its “rightful male owners” not “just” the cardcarrying reactionaries who propose to protect “their” women and families from cutthroat individualism crass consumerism and “vice” the reaction also includes fastgrowing rightwing populist movements that gain mass support by identifying some real downsides of capitalist modernityincluding its failure to protect families and communities from the ravages of the market
294,however both neotraditional and rightwing populist forces twist those legitimate grievances to fuel precisely the sort of opposition that capital can well afford
295,theirs is a mode of “protection” that pins the rap on sexual freedom while obscuring the true source of danger which is capital
296,sexual reaction finds its mirror image in sexual liberalism
297,the latter is tied even in the bestcase scenarios to policies that deprive the overwhelming majority of the social and material prerequisites needed to realize their new formal freedomsconsider for instance how states that claim to recognize the rights of trans people simultaneously refuse to defray the costs of transition
298,sexual liberalism is also tied to statecentered regulatory regimes that normalize and enforce the monogamous family conformity to which is the price of acceptance for gays and lesbians
299,while appearing to valorize individual freedom sexual liberalism leaves unchallenged the structural conditions that fuel homophobia and transphobia including the role of the family in social reproduction
300,outside the family too what passes for sexual liberation often recycles capitalist values
301,new heterosexual cultures based on hookups and online dating urge young women to “own” their sexuality but continue to rate them by their looks as defined by men
302,exhorting “selfownership” neoliberal discourses pressure girls to pleasure boys licensing male sexual selfishness in exemplary capitalist fashion
303,likewise new forms of “gay normality” presuppose capitalist normality
304,emerging gay middle classes are defined in many countries by their mode of consumption and claim to respectability
305,not only does this stratum’s acceptance coexist with the continuing marginalization and repression of poor queer people especially queer people of color it also figures in “pinkwashing” as those in power cite their acceptance of “rightthinking rightliving” gays to legitimate imperialist and neocolonial projects
306,for example israeli state agencies cite their superior “gayfriendly” culture to justify their brutal subjugation of “backward homophobic” palestinians
307,similarly some european liberals invoke their own “enlightened toleration” of lgbtq individuals in order to legitimate hostility toward muslims whom they equate indiscriminately with reaction while giving nonmuslim sexauthoritarians a free pass
308,the upshot is that today’s liberation movements are caught between a rock and a hard place one side wants to deliver women and lgbtq people to religious or patriarchal domination while the other would hand us over on a platter for direct predation by capital
309,feminists for the 99 percent refuse to play this game
310,rejecting both neoliberal cooptation and neotraditional homophobia and misogyny we want to revive the radical spirit of the 1969 stonewall uprising in new york of “sexpositive” currents of feminism from alexandra kollontai to gayle rubin and of the historic lesbian and gay support campaign for the 1984 british miner’s strike
311,we fight to liberate sexuality not only from procreation and normative family forms but also from the restrictions of gender class and race and from the deformations of statism and consumerism
312,we know however that to realize this dream we must build a new noncapitalist form of society that assures the material bases of sexual liberation among them generous public support for social reproduction redesigned for a much wider range of families and personal associations
313,today as in previous moments of acute capitalist crisis “race” has become a redhot issue inflamed and intensely contested
314,encouraged by demagogues purporting to champion aggrieved majorities an aggressively ethnonationalist rightwing populism dispenses with “mere” dog whistles in favor of fullthroated blasts of european and white supremacy
315,craven centrist governments join their outrightracist counterparts in blocking the entry of migrants and refugees seizing their children and separating their families interning them in camps or leaving them to drown at sea
316,meanwhile police in brazil the united states and elsewhere continue to murder people of color with impunity while courts cage them in forprofit prisons in record numbers and for extended terms
317,many are scandalized by these developments and some have tried to fight back
318,activists in germany brazil the united states and elsewhere have turned out in force to protest racist police violence and demonstrations by white supremacists
319,some are struggling to give new meaning to the term “abolition” demanding an end to incarceration and the elimination of ice the us government agency charged with enforcing immigration restrictions
320,nevertheless many antiracist forces limit their interventions to moral denunciation
321,others choose to play with fire–witness those currents of leftwing parties in europe that propose to “coopt” the right by themselves opposing immigration
322,in this situation feminists like everyone else must take sides
323,historically however the feminist record in dealing with race has been mixed at best
324,influential white us suffragists indulged in explicitly racist rants after the civil war when black men were granted the vote and they were not
325,in the same period and well into the twentieth century leading british feminists defended colonial rule in india on racially coded “civilizational” grounds as necessary to “raise up brown women from their lowly condition” even today prominent feminists in european countries justify antimuslim policies in similar terms
326,feminism’s historic entanglement with racism has also assumed “subtler” forms
327,even where they were not explicitly or intentionally racist liberal and radical feminists alike have defined “sexism” and “gender issues” in ways that falsely universalize the situation of white middleclass women
328,abstracting gender from race and class they have prioritized “women’s” need to escape from domesticity and “go out to work”as if all of us were suburban housewives
329,following the same logic leading white feminists in the united states have insisted that black women could only be truly feminist if they prioritized an imagined post or nonracial sisterhood over antiracist solidarity with black men
330,it is only thanks to decades of determined pushback by feminists of color that such views are increasingly seen for what they are and are now rejected by growing numbers of feminists of every hue
331,feminists for the 99 percent forthrightly acknowledge this shameful history and resolve to break decisively with it
332,we understand that nothing that deserves the name of “women’s liberation” can be achieved in a racist imperialist society
333,but we also understand that the root of the problem is capitalism and that racism and imperialism are integral to the latter
334,this social system which prides itself on “free labor” and “the wage contract” could only get started thanks to violent colonial plunder the “commercial hunting of blackskins” in africa their forcible conscription into “new world” slavery and the dispossession of indigenous peoples
335,but far from ceasing once capitalism got off the ground the racialized expropriation of unfree or dependent peoples has served ever since as a hidden enabling condition for the profitable exploitation of “free labor” the distinction between free exploited “workers” and dependent expropriated “others” has assumed different forms throughout capitalism’s historyin slavery colonialism apartheid and the international division of laborand it has blurred at times
336,but in every phase it has coincided however roughly with the global color line
337,in every phase too up to and including the present the expropriation of racialized people has enabled capital to increase its profits by confiscating natural resources and human capacities for whose replenishment and reproduction it does not pay
338,for systemic reasons capitalism has always created classes of racialized human beings whose persons and work are devalued and subject to expropriation
339,a feminism that is truly antiracist and antiimperialist must also be anticapitalist
340,that proposition is as true as ever now when racialized expropriation is proceeding on steroids
341,intensifying dispossession by debt today’s neoliberal capitalism promotes racial oppression throughout the world
342,in the “postcolonial” global south debtfueled corporate land grabs drive masses of indigenous and tribal peoples from their landsand in some cases to suicide
343,at the same time the “restructuring” of sovereign debt sends the ratio of interest to gdp through the roof forcing supposedly independent states to slash social spending and condemning future generations of southern workers to devote an evergrowing share of their labor to the repayment of global lenders
344,in these ways racialized expropriation continues alongside and is intertwined with a rise in exploitation propelled by the relocation of much manufacturing to the global south
345,in the global north too this oppression continues apace
346,as lowwaged precarious service work replaces unionized industrial labor wages fall below the bare minimum necessary to live a decent life especially in jobs where racialized workers predominate
347,not only are these workers forced to take on multiple jobs and to borrow against future wages in order to survive they are also targeted for hyperexpropriative payday and subprime loans
348,the social wage is declining as well as services that used to be provided publicly are offloaded onto families and communitieswhich is to say chiefly onto minority and immigrant women
349,likewise tax revenues previously dedicated to public infrastructure are diverted to debt service with especially disastrous effects for communities of colorspatially segregated and long deprived of public funds for schools and hospitals housing and transport provision of clean air and water
350,at every level and in every region financialized capitalism brings major new waves of racialized expropriation
351,the effects of this global pyramid scheme are gendered as well
352,today millions of black and migrant women are employed as caregivers and domestic workers
353,often undocumented and far from their families they are simultaneously exploited and expropriatedforced to work precariously and on the cheap deprived of rights and subject to abuses of every stripe
354,forged by global care chains their oppression enables better conditions for more privileged women who avoid some domestic work and pursue demanding professions
355,how ironic then that some of these privileged women invoke women’s rights in support of political campaigns to jail black men as rapists to persecute migrants and muslims and to require that black and muslim women assimilate to dominant culture
356,the truth is that racism imperialism and ethnonationalism are essential buttresses of generalized misogyny and the control over all women’s bodies
357,because their operation harms all of us all of us need to fight them tooth and nail
358,but abstract proclamations of global sisterhood are counterproductive
359,treating what is really the goal of a political process as if it were given at the outset they convey a false impression of homogeneity
360,the reality is that although we all suffer misogynist oppression in capitalist society our oppression assumes different forms
361,not always immediately visible the links between those forms of oppression must be revealed politicallythat is through conscious efforts to build solidarity
362,only in this way by struggling in and through our diversity can we achieve the combined power we need if we hope to transform society
363,today’s crisis of capitalism is also an ecological crisis
364,capitalism has always sought to bolster its profits by commandeering natural resources which it treats as free and infinite and which it often steals outright
365,structurally primed to appropriate nature without any regard for replenishment capitalism periodically destabilizes its own ecological conditions of possibilitywhether by exhausting the soil and depleting mineral wealth or by poisoning the water and air
366,while today’s ecological crisis is not the first in capitalism’s history it is surely the most global and pressing yet
367,the climate change now threatening the planet is a direct outgrowth of capital’s historic resort to fossilized energy in order to power its signature massproduction industrial factories
368,it was not “humanity” in general but capital that extracted carbonized deposits formed over hundreds of millions of years beneath the crust of the earth and it was capital that consumed them in the blink of an eye with total disregard for replenishment or the impacts of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
369,subsequent shifts first from coal to oil and then to fracking and natural gas have only ramped up carbon emissions while disproportionately offloading the “externalities” onto poor communities often communities of color in the global north and the global south
370,if today’s ecological crisis is directly tied to capitalism it also reproduces and worsens women’s oppression
371,women occupy the front lines of the present ecological crisis making up 80 percent of climate refugees
372,in the global south they constitute the vast majority of the rural workforce even as they also bear responsibility for the lion’s share of socialreproductive labor
373,because of their key role in providing food clothing and shelter for their families women play an outsized part in coping with drought pollution and the overexploitation of land
374,likewise poor women of color in the global north are disproportionately vulnerable
375,subject to environmental racism they constitute the backbone of communities subject to flooding and lead poisoning
376,women are also at the forefront of struggles against the growing ecological catastrophe
377,decades ago in the united states the militant leftwing group women strike for peace agitated against atomic weapons that had deposited strontium90 in our bones
378,today women spearhead the water protectors’ fight against the dakota access pipeline in the united states
379,in peru they powered máxima acuña’s successful battle against the us mining giant newmont
380,in north india garhwali women are fighting against the construction of three hydroelectric dams
381,across the globe women lead myriad struggles against the privatization of water and seed and for the preservation of biodiversity and sustainable farming
382,in all these cases women model new integrated forms of struggle that challenge the tendency of mainstream environmentalists to frame the defense of “nature” and the material wellbeing of human communities as mutually antithetical
383,in their refusal to separate ecological issues from those of social reproduction these womenled movements represent a powerful anticorporate and anticapitalist alternative to “green capitalist” projects that do nothing to stop global warming while enriching those who speculate in “emissions permits” “ecosystem services” “carbon offsets” and “environmental derivatives” unlike those “green finance” projects which dissolve nature into a miasma of quantitative abstraction women’s struggles focus on the real world in which social justice the wellbeing of human communities and the sustainability of nonhuman nature are inextricably bound up together
384,the liberation of women and the preservation of our planet from ecological disaster go hand in handwith each other and with the overcoming of capitalism
385,today’s crisis is also political
386,paralyzed by gridlock and hobbled by global finance states that once claimed to be democratic routinely fail to address pressing problems at all let alone in the public interest most of them punt on climate change and financial reform when they don’t openly block the path to solutions
387,captured by corporate power and enfeebled by debt governments are increasingly seen by their subjects as handmaidens of capital which dance to the tune of central banks and international investors it mammoths energy magnates and war profiteers
388,is it any wonder that masses of people throughout the world have given up on mainstream parties and politicians that have promoted neoliberalism including those of the centerleft
389,political crisis is rooted in the institutional structure of capitalist society
390,this system divides “the political” from “the economic” the “legitimate violence” of the state from the “silent compulsion” of the market
391,the effect is to declare vast swaths of social life off limits to democratic control and turn them over to direct corporate domination
392,by virtue of its very structure therefore capitalism deprives us of the ability to decide collectively exactly what and how much to produce on what energic basis and through what kinds of social relations
393,it robs us too of the capacity to determine how we want to use the social surplus we collectively produce how we want to relate to nature and to future generations and how we want to organize the work of social reproduction and its relation to that of production
394,capitalism in sum is fundamentally antidemocratic
395,at the same time capitalism necessarily generates an imperialist world geography
396,this system authorizes powerful states of the global north to prey on weaker ones to siphon value from them through trade regimes tilted against them and to crush them with debt to threaten them with military intervention and the withholding of “aid” the effect is to deny political protection to much of the world’s population
397,apparently the democratic aspirations of billions of people in the global south are not even worth coopting
398,they can simply be ignored or brutally repressed
399,everywhere too capital tries to have it both ways
400,on the one hand it freeloads off of public power availing itself of legal regimes that secure private property and the repressive forces that suppress opposition helping itself to infrastructures necessary for accumulation and the regulatory agencies tasked with managing crises
401,on the other hand the thirst for profit periodically tempts some factions of the capitalist class to rebel against public power which they badmouth as inferior to markets and scheme to weaken
402,when such shortterm interests trump longterm survival capital assumes the form of a tiger that eats its own tail
403,it threatens to destroy the very political institutions that it depends upon for survival
404,capitalism’s tendency to generate political crisisat work even in the best of timeshas reached a fever pitch
405,the current neoliberal regime openly wields not only military hardware but also the weapon of debt as it brazenly targets any public powers and political forces that might challenge itfor example by nullifying elections and referenda that reject austerity as in greece in 2015 and by preventing those that might do so as in brazil in 2017–18
406,throughout the world leading capitalist interests big fruit big pharma big oil and big arms have systematically promoted authoritarianism and repression coups d’états and imperial wars
407,in direct refutation of the claims of its partisans this social system reveals itself to be structurally incompatible with democracy
408,it is once again women who are major casualties of capitalism’s current political crisisand they are also principal actors in the struggle for an emancipatory resolution
409,for us however the solution is not simply to install more women in the citadels of power
410,having long been excluded from the public sphere we have had to fight tooth and nail to be heard on matterssuch as sexual assault and harassmentthat have been routinely dismissed as “private” ironically however our claims are often ventriloquized by elite “progressives” who inflect them in terms favorable to capital they invite us to identify with and vote for women politicians however unsavory who ask us to celebrate their ascent to positions of poweras if it struck a blow for our liberation
411,but there is nothing feminist about rulingclass women who do the dirty work of bombing other countries and sustaining regimes of apartheid of backing neocolonial interventions in the name of humanitarianism while remaining silent about the genocides perpetrated by their own governments of expropriating defenseless populations through structural adjustment imposed debt and forced austerity
412,in reality women are the first victims of colonial occupation and war throughout the world
413,they face systematic harassment political rape and enslavement while enduring the murder and maiming of their loved ones and the destruction of the infrastructures that enabled them to provide for themselves and their families in the first place
414,we stand in solidarity with these womennot with warmongers in skirts who demand gender and sexual liberation for their kin alone
415,to the state bureaucrats and financial managers both male and female who purport to justify their warmongering by claiming to liberate brown and black women we say not in our name
416,feminists for the 99 percent do not operate in isolation from other movements of resistance and rebellion
417,we do not separate ourselves from battles against climate change or exploitation in the workplace nor do we stand aloof from struggles against institutional racism and dispossession
418,those struggles are our struggles part and parcel of the struggle to dismantle capitalism without which there can be no end to gender and sexual oppression
419,the upshot is clear feminism for the 99 percent must join forces with other anticapitalist movements across the globewith environmentalist antiracist antiimperialist and lgbtq movements and labor unions
420,we must ally above all with leftwing anticapitalist currents of those movements that also champion the 99 percent
421,this path pits us squarely against both of the principal political options that capital now offers
422,we reject not only reactionary populism but also progressive neoliberalism
423,in fact it is by splitting both those alliances that we intend to build our movement
424,in the case of progressiveneoliberalism we aim to separate the mass of workingclass women immigrants and people of color from the leanin feminists the meritocratic antiracists and antihomophobes and the corporatediversity and greencapitalism shills who hijacked their concerns and inflected them in capitalfriendly terms
425,with respect to reactionary populism we aim to separate workingclass communities from the forces promoting militarism xenophobia and ethnonationalism that falsely present themselves as defenders of the “common man” while promoting plutocracy on the sly
426,our strategy is to win over the workingclass fractions of both of those procapitalist political blocs
427,in this way we seek to build an anticapitalist force that is large and powerful enough to transform society
428,struggle is both an opportunity and a school
429,it can transform those who participate in it challenging our prior understandings of ourselves and reshaping our views of the world
430,struggle can deepen our comprehension of our own oppressionwhat causes it who benefits and what must be done to overcome it
431,and further it can prompt us to reinterpret our interests reframe our hopes and expand our sense of what is possible
432,finally the experience of struggle can also induce us to rethink who should count as an ally and who as an enemy
433,it can broaden the circle of solidarity among the oppressed and sharpen our antagonism to our oppressors
434,the operative word here is “can” everything depends on our ability to develop a guiding perspective that neither simply celebrates nor brutally obliterates the differences among us
435,contra fashionable ideologies of “multiplicity” the various oppressions we suffer do not form an inchoate contingent plurality
436,although each has its own distinctive forms and characteristics all are rooted in and reinforced by one and the same social system
437,it is by naming that system as capitalism and by joining together to fight against it that we can best overcome the divisions among us that capital cultivatesdivisions of culture race ethnicity ability sexuality and gender
438,but we must understand capitalism in the right way
439,contra narrow oldschool understandings industrial wage labor is not the sum total of the working class nor is its exploitation the apex of capitalist domination
440,to insist on its primacy is not to foster but rather to weaken class solidarity
441,in reality class solidarity is best advanced by reciprocal recognition of the relevant differences among usour disparate structural situations experiences and sufferings our specific needs desires and demands and the varied organizational forms through which we can best achieve them
442,in this way feminism for the 99 percent seeks to overcome familiar stale oppositions between “identity politics” and “class politics” rejecting the zerosum framework capitalism constructs for us feminism for the 99 percent aims to unite existing and future movements into a broadbased global insurgency
443,armed with a vision that is at once feminist antiracist and anticapitalist we pledge to play a major role in shaping our future
444,writing a feminist manifesto is a daunting task
445,anyone who tries it today stands on the shouldersand in the shadowof marx and engels
446,their 1848 communist manifesto began with a memorable line “a spectre is haunting europe” the “spectre” of course was communism a revolutionary project they depicted as the culmination of workingclass struggles viewed as on the march unifying internationalizing and metamorphosing into a worldhistorical force that would eventually abolish capitalismand with it all exploitation domination and alienation
447,we found this predecessor immensely inspiring not least because it rightly identifies capitalism as the ultimate basis of oppression in modern society
448,but it complicated our task not only because the communist manifesto is a literary masterpiecehence a tough act to followbut also because 2018 is not 1848 it is true that we too live in a world of tremendous social and political upheavalwhich we too understand as a crisis of capitalism
449,but today’s world is much more globalized than that of marx and engels and the upheavals traversing it are by no means confined to europe
450,likewise we too encounter conflicts over nation raceethnicity and religion in addition to those of class
451,but our world also encompasses politicized fault lines unknown to them sexuality disability and ecology and its gender struggles have a breadth and intensity that marx and engels could scarcely have imagined
452,faced as we are with a more fractured and heterogeneous political landscape it is not so easy for us to imagine a globally unified revolutionary force
453,as latecomers moreover we are also more aware than marx and engels could possibly have been of the many ways in which emancipatory movements can go wrong
454,the historical memory we inherit includes the degeneration of the bolshevik revolution into the absolutist stalinist state european social democracy’s capitulation to nationalism and war and a slew of authoritarian regimes installed in the aftermath of anticolonial struggles throughout the global south
455,especially important for us is the recuperation of the emancipatory movements of our own time which have become allies of and alibis for the forces that fostered neoliberalism
456,this latter experience has been painful for leftwing feminists as we have witnessed mainstream liberal currents of our movement reduce our cause to the meritocratic advancement of the few
457,this history could not fail to shape our expectations differently than those of marx and engels
458,whereas they were writing in an era where capitalism was still relatively young we face a wily aging system far more adept at cooptation and coercion
459,and today’s political landscape is replete with traps
460,as we explained in our manifesto the most dangerous trap for feminists lies in thinking that our current political options are limited to two on the one hand a “progressive” variant of neoliberalism which diffuses an elitist corporate version of feminism to cast an emancipatory veneer over a predatory oligarchic agenda on the other a reactionary variant of neoliberalism which pursues a similar plutocratic agenda by other meansdeploying misogynist and racist tropes to burnish its “populist” credentials
461,certainly these two forces are not identical
462,but both are mortal enemies of a genuinely emancipatory and majoritarian feminism
463,plus they are mutually enabling progressive neoliberalism created the conditions for the rise of reactionary populism and is now positioning itself as the goto alternative to it
464,our manifesto embodies a refusal to choose sides in this battle
465,rejecting a menu that limits our choices to two different strategies for managing capitalist crisis we wrote it to forward an alternative to both
466,committed not simply to managing but to resolving the present crisis we sought to make visible and practicable some latent emancipatory possibilities that the current alignments obscure
467,determined to break up liberal feminism’s cozy alliance with finance capital we proposed another feminism a feminism for the 99 percent
468,we came to this project after having worked together on the 2017 women’s strike in the united states
469,prior to that each of us had written individually about the relation between capitalism and gender oppression
470,cinzia arruzza had parsed the fraught relations between feminism and socialism both historically and theoretically
471,tithi bhattacharya had theorized the implications of social reproduction for the concepts of class and class struggle
472,nancy fraser had developed enlarged conceptions of capitalism and capitalist crisis of which the crisis of social reproduction forms one strand
473,notwithstanding these different emphases we joined forces to write this manifesto because of a shared understanding of the present conjuncture
474,for all three of us this moment represents a crucial juncture in the history of feminism and capitalism a juncture that demands and enables an intervention
475,in this context our decision to write a feminist manifesto was tied to a political objective we sought to effect a rescue operation and course correctionto reorient feminist struggles in a time of political confusion
476,the conjuncture our manifesto responds to is best understood as a crisis
477,but we don’t intend that word in the loose and obvious sense that things are bad
478,although present calamities and sufferings are horrific what justifies our use of the term “crisis” is something more the numerous harms we experience today are neither mutually unrelated nor the products of chance
479,they stem instead from the societal system that underlies all of thema system that generates them not accidentally but as a matter of course by virtue of its constitutive dynamics
480,our manifesto names that social system capitalism and characterizes the present crisis as a crisis of capitalism
481,but we do not understand those terms in the usual way
482,as feminists we appreciate that capitalism is not just an economic system but something larger an institutionalized social order that also encompasses the apparently “noneconomic” relations and practices that sustain the official economy
483,behind capitalism’s official institutionswage labor production exchange and financestand their necessary supports and enabling conditions families communities nature territorial states political organizations and civil societies and not least of all massive amounts and multiple forms of unwaged and expropriated labor including much of the work of social reproduction still performed largely by women and often uncompensated
484,these too are constitutive elements of capitalist societyand sites of struggle within it
485,from this expansive understanding of capitalism follows our manifesto’s broad view of capitalist crisis
486,without denying its inherent tendency to spawn intermittent market crashes bankruptcy chains and mass unemployment we recognize that capitalism also harbors other “noneconomic” contradictions and crisis tendencies
487,it contains for example an ecological contradiction an inherent tendency to reduce nature to a “tap” dispensing energy and raw materials on one hand and to a “sink” for absorbing waste on the otherboth capacities that capital appropriates freely but does not replenish
488,as a result capitalist societies are structurally inclined to destabilize the habitats that sustain communities and to destroy the ecosystems that sustain life
489,likewise this social formation houses a political contradiction a builtin tendency to limit the purview of politics devolving fundamental matters of life and death to the rule of “the markets” and turning state institutions that are supposed to serve the public into capital’s servants
490,for systemic reasons therefore capitalism is disposed to frustrate democratic aspirations to hollow out rights and defang public powers and to generate brutal repression endless wars and crises of governance
491,finally capitalist society harbors a socialreproductive contradiction a tendency to commandeer for capital’s benefit as much “free” reproductive labor as possible without any concern for its replenishment
492,as a result it periodically gives rise to “crises of care” which exhaust women ravage families and stretch social energies to the breaking point
493,in our manifesto in other words capitalist crisis is not only economic but also ecological political and socialreproductive
494,in every case moreover the root is the same capital’s inherent drive to freeride on its own indispensable background conditionsprerequisites for whose reproduction it aims not to pay
495,those conditions include the atmosphere’s ability to absorb carbon emissions the state’s capacity to defend property put down rebellion and safeguard money and of central importance for us the unwaged work of forming and sustaining human beings
496,without them capital could neither exploit “workers” nor succeed in accumulating profits
497,but if it can’t live without these background conditions its logic also drives it to disavow them
498,if forced to pay the full replacement costs of nature public power and social reproduction capital’s profits would dwindle to the vanishing point
499,better to cannibalize the system’s own conditions of possibility than to jeopardize accumulation
500,it is therefore a premise of our manifesto that capitalism harbors multiple contradictions above and beyond those that stem from its official economy
501,in “normal” times the system’s crisis tendencies remain more or less latent afflicting “only” those populations deemed disposable and powerless
502,but these are not normal times
503,today all of capitalism’s contradictions have reached the boiling point
504,virtually no onewith the partial exception of the 1 percentescapes the impacts of political dislocation economic precarity and socialreproductive depletion
505,and climate change of course threatens to destroy all life on the planet
506,the recognition is growing too that these catastrophic developments are so deeply intertwined that none can be resolved apart from the others
507,our manifesto deals with every facet of the present crisis
508,but we take a special interest in the socialreproductive aspect which is structurally connected to gender asymmetry
509,so let us enquire more deeply what exactly is social reproduction
510,consider the case of “luo” a taiwanese mother identified only by her last name she filed a suit in 2017 against her son claiming recompense for the time and money she had invested in his upbringing
511,luo had raised two sons as a single mother putting both of them through dental school
512,in return she expected them to take care of her in her old age
513,when one of the sons failed to satisfy her expectations she sued him
514,in an unprecedented ruling the taiwanese supreme court ordered the son to pay his mother us967000 as his “upbringing” cost
515,luo’s case illustrates three fundamental features of life under capitalism
516,first it discloses a human universal that capitalism would prefer to ignore and tries to hide that enormous amounts of time and resources are necessary to birth care for and maintain human beings
517,second it underlines that much of the work of creating andor maintaining human beings is still done by women in our society
518,finally it reveals that in the normal course of things capitalist society accords no value to this work even while depending upon it
519,luo’s case also prompts us to entertain a fourth proposition which figures centrally in our manifesto that capitalist society is composed of two inextricably braided but mutually opposed imperativesthe need of the system to sustain itself through its signature process of profitmaking versus the need of human beings to sustain themselves through processes that we called peoplemaking
520,“social reproduction” refers to the second imperative
521,it encompasses activities that sustain human beings as embodied social beings who must not only eat and sleep but also raise their children care for their families and maintain their communities all while pursuing their hopes for the future
522,these peoplemaking activities occur in one form or another in every society
523,in capitalist societies however they must also serve another masternamely capital which requires that socialreproductive work produce and replenish “labor power” bent on securing an adequate supply of that “peculiar commodity” at the lowest possible cost to itself capital offloads the work of social reproduction onto women communities and states all the while twisting it into forms best suited to maximize its profits
524,various branches of feminist theory including marxist feminism socialist feminism and social reproduction theory have analyzed the contradictions between the profitmaking and peoplemaking tendencies in capitalist societies exposing capital’s inherent drive to instrumentalize the second to the needs of the first
525,readers of marx’s capital know about exploitation the injustice that capital inflicts on waged workers at the point of production
526,in that setting workers are supposed to be paid enough to cover their living expenses while in reality they produce more
527,in a nutshell our bosses require us to work more hours than necessary to reproduce ourselves our families and the infrastructures of our societies
528,they appropriate the surplus we produce in the form of profit on behalf of the owners and shareholders
529,social reproduction theorists do not so much reject this picture as note its incompleteness
530,like marxist and socialist feminists we raise some pesky questions what did the worker have to do before she arrived at work
531,who cooked her dinner made her bed and soothed her distress so that she could return to the job one tiring day after another
532,did someone else do all this peoplemaking work or was it she herself who performed itnot only for herself but also for the other members of her family
533,these questions disclose a truth that capitalism conspires to obscure the waged work of profitmaking could not exist without the mostly unwaged work of peoplemaking
534,thus the capitalist institution of wage labor conceals something more than surplus value
535,it also conceals its birthmarksthe labor of social reproduction that is its condition of possibility
536,the social processes and institutions necessary for both kinds of “production”that of people and that of profitswhile analytically distinct are nevertheless mutually constitutive
537,the distinction between them moreover is itself an artifact of capitalist society
538,as we said peoplemaking work has always existed and it has always been associated with women
539,but earlier societies knew no sharp division between “economic production” and social reproduction
540,only with the advent of capitalism were those two aspects of social existence split apart
541,production moved into factories mines and offices where it was considered “economic” and remunerated with cash wages
542,reproduction was relegated to “the family” where it was feminized and sentimentalized defined as “care” as opposed to “work” performed for the sake of “love” as opposed to money
543,or so we were told
544,in fact capitalist societies have never located social reproduction exclusively in private households but have always situated some of it in neighborhoods grassroots communities public institutions and civil society and they have long commodified some reproductive laboralthough nowhere near as much as today
545,nevertheless the division between profitmaking and peoplemaking points to a deepseated tension at the heart of capitalist society
546,while capital strives systemically to increase profits workingclass people strive conversely to lead decent and meaningful lives as social beings
547,these are fundamentally irreconcilable goals for capital’s share of accumulation can only increase at the expense of our share in the life of society
548,social practices that nourish our lives at home and social services that nurture our lives outside of it constantly threaten to cut into profits
549,thus a financial drive to reduce those costs and an ideological drive to undermine such labors are endemic to the system as a whole
550,if capitalism’s story was simply one in which profitmaking vanquishes peoplemaking then the system could legitimately declare victory
551,but the history of capitalism is also shaped by struggles for decent and meaningful lives
552,it is no coincidence that wage struggles are often referred to as struggles over “bread and butter” issues
553,it is a mistake however to restrict those issues to workplace demands alone as traditional labor movements have often done
554,they overlook the stormy unsettled relationship between wages and life in a system where capital ordains the former as the only means to the latter
555,working people do not struggle for the wage rather they struggle for the wage because they want bread and butter
556,the desire for sustenance is the determinant not the consequence
557,thus struggles over food housing water health care or education are not always expressed through the mediated form of the wagethat is to say as demands for higher wages within the workplace
558,recall for instance that the two greatest revolutions of the modern era the french and the russian began with bread riots led by women
559,the true aim of social reproduction struggles is to establish the primacy of peoplemaking over profitmaking
560,they are never about bread alone
561,for this reason a feminism for the 99 percent incarnates and fosters the struggle for bread and roses
562,in the conjuncture our manifesto analyzes social reproduction is the site of a major crisis
563,the basic reason we argued is that capitalism’s treatment of social reproduction is contradictory
564,on the one hand the system cannot function without this activity on the other it disavows the latter’s costs and accords it little or no economic value
565,what this means is that the capacities available for social reproductive work are taken for granted treated as free and infinitely available “gifts” that require no attention or replenishment
566,when the matter is considered at all it is assumed that there will always be sufficient energies to produce the laborers and sustain the social connections on which economic production and society more generally depend
567,in fact socialreproductive capacities are not infinite and they can be stretched to the breaking point
568,when a society simultaneously withdraws public support for social reproduction and conscripts its chief providers into long and grueling hours of lowpaid work it depletes the very social capacities on which it relies
569,this is exactly our situation today
570,the current neoliberal form of capitalism is systematically depleting our collective and individual capacities to regenerate human beings and to sustain social bonds
571,at first sight this regime appears to be breaking down capitalism’s constitutive gender division between productive and reproductive labor
572,proclaiming the new ideal of the “twoearner family” neoliberalism recruits women massively into wage labor across the globe
573,but this ideal is a fraud and the labor regime it is supposed to legitimate is anything but liberatory for women
574,what is presented as emancipation is in fact a system of intensified exploitation and expropriation
575,at the same time it is also an engine of acute socialreproductive crisis
576,it is true of course that a thin stratum of women derives some gains from neoliberalism as they enter prestigious professions and the lower rungs of corporate management albeit on terms less favorable than those available to the men of their class
577,what awaits the vast majority however is something else lowpaid precarious workin sweatshops exportprocessing zones megacities’ construction industries corporatized agriculture and the service sectorwhere poor racialized and immigrant women serve fast food and sell cheap stuff at megastores clean offices hotel rooms and private homes empty bedpans in hospitals and nursing homes and care for the families of more privileged strataoften at the expense of and sometimes far away from their own
578,some of this work commodifies reproductive labor that was previously performed without pay
579,but if the effect of such commodification is to muddy capitalism’s historical division between production and reproduction it is equally certain that this outcome does not emancipate women
580,on the contrary nearly all of us are still required to work “the second shift” even as more of our time and energy are appropriated by capital
581,and of course the bulk of women’s waged work is decidedly unliberating
582,precarious and poorly paid and providing access neither to labor rights nor to social entitlements it also fails to afford autonomy selfrealization or the opportunity to acquire and exercise skills
583,what this work does provide by contrast is vulnerability to abuse and harassment
584,equally importantly the wages we earn within this regime are often insufficient to cover the costs of our own social reproduction let alone that of our families
585,access to the wage of another household member helps of course but is still rarely enough
586,as a result many of us are forced to work multiple “mcjobs” traveling long distances between them via expensive deteriorating and unsafe means of transport
587,in comparison with the postwar era the number of hours of waged work per household has skyrocketed cutting deep into the time available to replenish ourselves care for our families and friends and maintain our homes and communities
588,far from inaugurating a feminist utopia then neoliberal capitalism in reality generalizes exploitation
589,not just men but women too are now forced to sell their labor power piecemealand cheaplyin order to survive
590,and that is not all today’s exploitation is overlaid with expropriation
591,refusing to pay the costs of reproducing its own increasingly feminized labor force capital is no longer content to appropriate “only” the surplus value its workers produce over and above their own means of subsistence
592,in addition it now drills deep into the bodies minds and families of those it exploits extracting not only surplus energies but also those needed for replenishment
593,mining social reproduction as a further source of profit it cuts into bone
594,capital’s assault on social reproduction also proceeds through the retrenchment of public social services
595,in the previous socialdemocratic or statemanaged phase of capitalist development working classes in wealthy countries won some concessions from capital in the form of state support for social reproduction pensions unemployment insurance child allowances free public education and health insurance
596,the result however was no golden age the gains achieved by majorityethnicity workers in the capitalist core rested on the often counterfactual assumption of women’s dependency through the family wage racialethnic exclusions from social security heteronormative eligibility criteria for social welfare and ongoing imperial expropriation in the “third world” nevertheless these concessions offered partial protection for some from capital’s inherent tendency to cannibalize social reproduction
597,neoliberal financialized capitalism is a different animal altogether
598,far from empowering states to stabilize social reproduction through public provision it authorizes finance capital to discipline states and publics in the immediate interests of private investors
599,its weapon of choice is debt
600,finance capital lives off of sovereign debt which it uses to outlaw even the mildest forms of socialdemocratic provision coercing states to liberalize their economies open their markets and impose “austerity” on defenseless populations
601,simultaneously it proliferates consumer debtfrom subprime mortgages to credit cards and student loans from payday loans to microcreditwhich it uses to discipline peasants and workers to keep them subservient on the land and on the job and to ensure that they continue to buy gmo seeds and cheap consumer goods at levels well above what their low wages would otherwise allow
602,in both ways the regime sharpens capitalism’s inherent contradiction between the imperative of accumulation and the requirements of social reproduction
603,simultaneously demanding increased working hours and retrenched public services it externalizes carework onto families and communities while diminishing their capacity to perform it
604,the result is a mad scramble on the part of women especially to shoehorn socialreproductive responsibilities into the interstices of lives that capital demands be devoted primarily to its accumulation
605,typically this means offloading carework onto less privileged others
606,the result is to forge “global care chains” as those who possess the means to do so hire poorer women often migrants andor members of racialized groups to clean their homes or care for their children and aging parents while they themselves pursue more lucrative work
607,but of course that leaves the lowpaid careworker scrambling to meet her own domestic and familial responsibilities often by transferring them to other stillpoorer women who in turn must do the sameand on and on often across great distances
608,this scenario fits the gendered strategies of indebted postcolonial states that have been subjected to “structural adjustment” desperate for hard currency some of these states have actively promoted women’s emigration to perform paid carework abroad for the sake of remittances while others have courted foreign direct investment by creating exportprocessing zones often in industries such as textiles and electronics assembly that prefer to employ lowpaid women workers who are then subject to rampant labor and sexual violence
609,in both cases socialreproductive capacities are further squeezed
610,far from filling the care gap the net effect is to displace it from richer to poorer families from the global north to the global south
611,the overall result is a new dualized organization of social reproduction commodified for those who can pay for it and privatized for those who cannot as some in the second category provide carework in return for low wages for those in the first
612,all of this adds up to what some call a “crisis of care” but that expression can easily mislead for as we argued in our manifesto this crisis is structuralpart and parcel of the broader general crisis of contemporary capitalism
613,given the latter’s severity it is no wonder that struggles over social reproduction have exploded over recent years
614,northern feminists often describe their focus as the “balance between family and work” but struggles over social reproduction encompass much moreincluding grassroots community movements for housing health care food security and an unconditional basic income struggles for the rights of migrants domestic workers and public employees campaigns to unionize social service workers in forprofit nursing homes hospitals and childcare centers and struggles for public services such as day care and elder care a shorter work week and generous paid maternity and parental leave
615,taken together these claims are tantamount to a demand for a massive reorganization of the relation between production and reproduction for social arrangements that prioritize people’s lives and social connections over production for profit for a world in which people of every gender nationality sexuality and color combine socialreproductive activities with safe wellremunerated and harassmentfree work
616,the preceding analysis informs the fundamental political point of our manifesto feminism must rise to the occasion of the current crisis
617,as we said this is a crisis that capitalism can at best displace but cannot solve
618,a true resolution requires nothing less than an entirely new form of social organization
619,certainly our manifesto does not prescribe the precise contours of an alternative as the latter must emerge in the course of the struggle to create it
620,but some things are already clear
621,contra liberal feminism sexism cannot be defeated by equalopportunity dominationnor contra ordinary liberalism by legal reform
622,by the same token and pace traditional understandings of socialism an exclusive focus on wage labor’s exploitation cannot emancipate womennor indeed working people of any gender
623,it is also necessary to target capital’s instrumentalization of unwaged reproductive labor to which exploitation is in any case tied
624,what is needed in fact is to overcome the system’s stubborn nexus of production and reproduction its entwinement of profitmaking with peoplemaking and its subordination of the second to the first
625,and this means abolishing the larger system that generates their symbiosis
626,our manifesto identifies liberal feminism as a major obstacle to this emancipatory project
627,that current achieved its present dominance by outlasting indeed reversing the feminist radicalism of the previous period
628,the latter had arisen in the 1970s on the crest of a powerful wave of anticolonial struggles against war racism and capitalism
629,sharing in their revolutionary ethos it questioned the entire structural basis of the existing order
630,but when the radicalism of that era subsided what emerged as hegemonic was a feminism shorn of utopian revolutionary aspirationsa feminism that reflected and accommodated mainstream liberal political culture
631,liberal feminism is not the whole story of course
632,combative antiracist and anticapitalist feminist currents have continued to exist
633,black feminists have produced insightful analyses of the intersection of class exploitation racism and gender oppression and newer materialist queer theories have disclosed important links between capitalism and the oppressive reification of sexual identities
634,militant collectives have kept up their hard daytoday grassroots work and marxist feminism is now undergoing a revival
635,nevertheless the rise of neoliberalism transformed the general context in which radical currents had to operate weakening every pro–working class movement while empowering corporatefriendly alternativesliberal feminism among them
636,today however liberal feminist hegemony has begun to crumble and a new wave of feminist radicalism has emerged from the rubble
637,as we noted in our manifesto the key innovation of the current movement is the adoption and reinvention of the strike
638,by striking feminists have taken a form of struggle identified with the workers’ movement and retooled it
639,withholding not only waged work but also the unwaged work of social reproduction they have disclosed the latter’s indispensable role in capitalist society
640,making visible women’s power they have challenged labor unions’ claim to “own” the strike
641,signaling their unwillingness to accept the existing order feminist strikers are redemocratizing labor struggle restating what should have been obvious strikes belong to the working class as a wholenot to a partial stratum of it nor to particular organizations
642,the potential effects are very farreaching
643,as we noted in our manifesto feminist strikes are forcing us to rethink what constitutes class and what counts as class struggle
644,karl marx famously theorized the working class as the “universal class” what he meant was that by fighting to overcome its own exploitation and domination the working class was also challenging a social system that oppresses the overwhelming majority of the world’s population and thereby forwarding the cause of humanity as such
645,but marx’s followers have not always grasped that neither the working class nor humanity is an undifferentiated homogenous entity and that universality cannot be achieved by ignoring their internal differences
646,we are still paying the price today for these political and intellectual lapses
647,while neoliberals cynically celebrate “diversity” in order to prettify capital’s predations too many sections of the left still fall back on the old formula holding that what unites us is an abstract and homogenous notion of class and that feminism and antiracism can only divide us
648,what is becoming increasingly clear however is that the standard portrait of the militant worker as white and male is badly out of sync with the timesindeed it was never accurate in the first place
649,as we argued in our manifesto today’s global working class also comprises billions of women immigrants and people of color
650,it struggles not only in the workplace but also around social reproduction from the food riots central to the arab revolutions to the movements against gentrification that occupied istanbul’s taksim square to the struggles against austerity and in defense of social reproduction that animated the indignados
651,our manifesto rejects both perspectives the classreductionist left one that conceives the working class as an empty homogeneous abstraction and the progressiveneoliberal one that celebrates diversity for its own sake
652,in their place we have proposed a universalism that acquires its form and content from the multiplicity of struggles from below
653,to be sure the differences inequalities and hierarchies that inhere in capitalist social relations do give rise to conflicts of interest among the oppressed and exploited
654,and by itself the proliferation of fragmentary struggles will not give birth to the sort of robust broadbased alliances needed to transform society
655,however such alliances will become utterly impossible if we fail to take our differences seriously
656,far from proposing to obliterate or trivialize them our manifesto advocates that we fight against capitalism’s weaponization of our differences
657,feminism for the 99 percent embodies this vision of universalism always in formation always open to transformation and contestation and always establishing itself anew through solidarity
658,feminism for the 99 percent is a restless anticapitalist feminismone that can never be satisfied with equivalences until we have equality never satisfied with legal rights until we have justice and never satisfied with democracy until individual freedom is calibrated on the basis of freedom for all
