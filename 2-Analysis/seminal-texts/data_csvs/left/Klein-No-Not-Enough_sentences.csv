11,it’s a word that has come up again and again since donald trump was elected in november 2016to describe the polldefying election results to describe the emotional state of many people watching his ascent to power and to describe his blitzkrieg approach to policy making
12,a “shock to the system” in fact is precisely how his adviser kellyanne conway has repeatedly described the new era
13,for almost two decades now i’ve been studying largescale shocks to societieshow they happen how they are exploited by politicians and corporations and how they are even deliberately deepened in order to gain advantage over a disoriented population
14,i have also reported on the flip side of this process how societies that come together around an understanding of a shared crisis can change the world for the better
15,watching donald trump’s rise i’ve had a strange feeling
16,it’s not just that he’s applying shock politics to the most powerful and heavily armed nation on earth
17,it’s more than that
18,in books documentary films and investigative reporting i have documented a range of trends the rise of superbrands the expanding power of private wealth over the political system the global imposition of neoliberalism often using racism and fear of the “other” as a potent tool the damaging impacts of corporate free trade and the deep hold that climate change denial has taken on the right side of the political spectrum
19,and as i began to research trump he started to seem to me like frankenstein’s monster sewn together out of the body parts of all of these and many other dangerous trends
20,ten years ago i published the shock doctrine the rise of disaster capitalism  an investigation that spanned four decades of history from chile after augusto pinochet’s coup to russia after the collapse of the soviet union from baghdad under the us “shock and awe” attack to new orleans after hurricane katrina
21,the term “shock doctrine” describes the quite brutal tactic of systematically using the public’s disorientation following a collective shockwars coups terrorist attacks market crashes or natural disastersto push through radical procorporate measures often called “shock therapy” though trump breaks the mold in some ways his shock tactics do follow a script one familiar from other countries that have had rapid changes imposed under the cover of crisis
22,during trump’s first week in office when he was signing that tsunami of executive orders and people were just reeling madly trying to keep up i found myself thinking about the human rights advocate halina bortnowska’s description of poland’s experience when the us imposed economic shock therapy on her country in the midst of communism’s collapse
23,she described the velocity of change her country was going through as “the difference between dog years and human years” and she observed that “you start witnessing these semipsychotic reactions
24,you can no longer expect people to act in their own best interests when they’re so disoriented they don’t knowor no longer carewhat those interests are” from the evidence so far it’s clear that trump and his top advisers are hoping for the sort of response bortnowska described that they are trying to pull off a domestic shock doctrine
25,the goal is allout war on the public sphere and the public interest whether in the form of antipollution regulations or programs for the hungry
26,in their place will be unfettered power and freedom for corporations
27,it’s a program so defiantly unjust and so manifestly corrupt that it can only be pulled off with the assistance of divideandconquer racial and sexual politics as well as a nonstop spectacle of media distractions
28,and of course it is being backed up with a massive increase in war spending a dramatic escalation of military conflicts on multiple fronts from syria to north korea alongside presidential musings about how “torture works” trump’s cabinet of billionaires and multimillionaires tells us a great deal about the administration’s underlying goals
29,exxonmobil for secretary of state
30,general dynamics and boeing to head the department of defense
31,and the goldman sachs guys for pretty much everything that’s left
32,the handful of career politicians who have been put in charge of agencies seem to have been selected either because they do not believe in the agency’s core mission or do not think the agency should exist at all
33,steve bannon trump’s apparently sidelined chief strategist was very open about this when he addressed a conservative audience in february 2017 the goal he said was the “deconstruction of the administrative state” by which he meant the government regulations and agencies tasked with protecting people and their rights
34,and “if you look at these cabinet nominees they were selected for a reason and that is deconstruction” much has been made of the conflict between bannon’s christian nationalism and the transnationalism of trump’s more establishment aides particularly his soninlaw jared kushner
35,and bannon may well get voted off this gory reality show entirely before long perhaps by the time you read these words
36,which is why it’s worth underlining that when it comes to deconstructing the state and outsourcing as much as possible to forprofit corporations bannon and kushner are not in conflict but in perfect alignment
37,as this has been unfolding it struck me that what’s happening in washington is not the usual passing of the baton between parties
38,it’s a naked corporate takeover one many decades in the making
39,it seems that the economic interests that have long since paid off both major parties to do their bidding have decided they’re tired of playing the game
40,apparently all that wining and dining of elected officials all that cajoling and legalized bribery insulted their sense of divine entitlement
41,so now they’re cutting out the middlementhose needy politicians who are supposed to protect the public interestand doing what all top dogs do when they want something done right they are doing it themselves
42,which is why serious questions about conflicts of interest and breaches of ethics barely receive a response
43,just as trump stonewalled on releasing his tax returns so he has completely refused to sell or to stop benefiting from his business empire
44,that decision given the trump organization’s reliance on foreign governments to grant valuable trademark licenses and permits may in fact contravene the united states constitution’s prohibition on presidents receiving gifts or any “emolument” from foreign governments
45,indeed a lawsuit making this allegation has already been launched
46,but the trumps seem unconcerned
47,a nearimpenetrable sense of impunityof being above the usual rules and lawsis a defining feature of this administration
48,anyone who presents a threat to that impunity is summarily firedjust ask former fbi director james comey
49,up to now in us politics there’s been a mask on the corporate state’s white house proxies the smiling actor’s face of ronald reagan or the faux cowboy persona of george w bush with dick cheneyhalliburton scowling in the background
50,now the mask is gone
51,and no one is even bothering to pretend otherwise
52,this situation is made all the more squalid by the fact that trump was never the head of a traditional company but has rather long been the figurehead of an empire built around his personal branda brand that has along with his daughter ivanka’s brand already benefited from its merger with the us presidency in countless ways
53,the trump family’s business model is part of a broader shift in corporate structure that has taken place within many brandbased multinationals one with transformative impacts on culture and the job market trends that i wrote about in my first book no logo taking aim at the brand bullies 
54,what this model tells us is that the very idea that there could beor should beany distinction between the trump brand and the trump presidency is a concept the current occupant of the white house cannot begin to comprehend
55,the presidency is in fact the crowning extension of the trump brand
56, as i explored trump’s inextricable relationship with his commercial brand and its implications for the future of politics i began to see why so many of the attacks on him have failed to stickand how we can identify ways of resisting him that will be more effective
57,the fact that such defiant levels of profiteering from public office can unfold in full view is disturbing enough
58,as are so many of trump’s actions in his first months in office
59,but history shows us that however destabilized things are now the shock doctrine means they could get a lot worse
60,the main pillars of trump’s political and economic project are the deconstruction of the regulatory state a fullbore attack on the welfare state and social services rationalized in part through bellicose racial fearmongering and attacks on women for exercising their rights the unleashing of a domestic fossil fuel frenzy which requires the sweeping aside of climate science and the gagging of large parts of the government bureaucracy and a civilizational war against immigrants and “radical islamic terrorism” with everexpanding domestic and foreign theaters
61,in addition to the obvious threats this entire project poses to those who are already most vulnerable it’s also a vision that can be counted on to generate wave after wave of crises and shocks
62,economic shocks as market bubblesinflated thanks to deregulationburst security shocks as blowback from antiislamic policies and foreign aggression comes home weather shocks as our climate is further destabilized and industrial shocks as oil pipelines spill and rigs collapse which they tend to do when the safety and environmental regulations that prevent chaos are slashed
63,all this is dangerous
64,even more so is the way the trump administration can be relied upon to exploit these shocks to push through the more radical planks of its agenda
65,a largescale crisiswhether a terrorist attack or a financial crash would likely provide the pretext to declare some sort of state of exception or emergency where the usual rules no longer apply
66,this in turn would provide the cover to push through aspects of the trump agenda that require a further suspension of core democratic norms such as his pledge to deny entry to all muslims not only those from selected countries his twitter threat to bring in “the feds” to quell street violence in chicago or his obvious desire to place restrictions on the press
67,a largeenough economic crisis would offer an excuse to dismantle programs like social security which trump pledged to protect but which many around him have wanted gone for decades
68,trump may have other reasons for upping the crisis level too
69,as the argentine novelist césar aira wrote in 2001 “any change is a change in the topic” trump has already proven headspinningly adept at changing the subject using everything from mad tweets to tomahawk missiles
70,indeed his air assault on syria in response to a gruesome chemical weapons attack won him the most laudatory press coverage of his presidency in some quarters it sparked an ongoing shift to a more respectful tone
71,whether in response to further revelations about russian connections or scandals related to his labyrinthine international business dealings we can expect much more of this topic changingand nothing has the ability to change the topic quite like a largescale shock
72,we don’t go into a state of shock when something big and bad happens it has to be something big and bad that we do not yet understand 
73,a state of shock is what results when a gap opens up between events and our initial ability to explain them
74,when we find ourselves in that position without a story without our moorings a great many people become vulnerable to authority figures telling us to fear one another and relinquish our rights for the greater good
75,this is today a global phenomenon not one restricted to the united states
76,after the coordinated terrorist attacks in paris in november 2015 the french government declared a state of emergency that banned political gatherings of more than five peopleand then extended that status and the ability to restrict public demonstrations for months
77,in britain after the shock of the brexit vote many said they felt as though they’d woken up in a new unrecognizable country
78,it was in that context that the uk’s conservative government began floating a range of regressive reforms including the idea that the only way for britain to regain its competitiveness is by slashing regulations and taxes on the wealthy so much that it would effectively become a tax haven for all of europe
79,it was also in this context that prime minister theresa may called a snap election against her lowpolling rival clearly in the hope of securing another term in office before the public has a chance to rebel against new austerity measures that are the antithesis of how brexit was originally sold to voters
80, for each of my previous books i spent five or six years deeply researching the subject examining it from many angles and reporting from the regions most impacted
81,the results are hefty tomes with a whole lot of endnotes
82,in contrast i’ve written this book in just a few months
83,i’ve kept it brief and conversational knowing that few of us have time these days for tomes and that others are already writing about parts of this intricate story that they grasp far better than me
84,but i’ve come to realize that the research i’ve done over the years can help shed some light on crucial aspects of trumpism
85,tracing the roots of his business model and of his economic policies reflecting on similar destabilizing moments from history and learning from people who found effective ways to resist shock tactics can go some way toward explaining how we ended up on this dangerous road how we can best withstand the shocks to come and more importantly how we can quickly get to much safer ground
86,this then is the beginning of a road map for shock resistance
87,here’s one thing i’ve learned from reporting from dozens of locations in the midst of crisis whether it was athens rocked by greece’s debt debacle or new orleans after hurricane katrina or baghdad during the us occupation these tactics can be resisted
88,to do so two crucial things have to happen
89,first we need a firm grasp on how shock politics work and whose interests they serve
90,that understanding is how we get out of shock quickly and start fighting back
91,second and equally important we have to tell a different story from the one the shock doctors are peddling a vision of the world compelling enough to compete headtohead with theirs
92,this values based vision must offer a different path away from serial shocksone based on coming together across racial ethnic religious and gender divides rather than being wrenched further apart and one based on healing the planet rather than unleashing further destabilizing wars and pollution
93,most of all that vision needs to offer those who are hurtingfor lack of jobs lack of health care lack of peace lack of hope a tangibly better life
94,i don’t claim to know exactly what that vision looks like
95,i am figuring it out with everyone else and i am convinced it can only be birthed out of a genuinely collaborative process with leadership coming from those most brutalized by our current system
96,in the final chapters of this book i’ll explore some early and very hopeful grassroots collaborations between dozens of organizations and thinkers who have come together to begin to lay out that kind of agenda one capable of competing with rising militarism nationalism and corporatism
97,though still in its early stages it is becoming possible to see the outlines of a progressive majority one grounded in a bold plan for the safe and caring world we all want and need
98,all this work is born of the knowledge that saying no to bad ideas and bad actors is simply not enough
99,the firmest of no’s has to be accompanied by a bold and forwardlooking yesa plan for the future that is credible and captivating enough that a great many people will fight to see it realized no matter the shocks and scare tactics thrown their way
100,noto trump to france’s marine le pen to any number of xenophobic and hypernationalist parties on the rise the world over may be what initially brings millions into the streets
101,but it is yes that will keep us in the fight
102,yes is the beacon in the coming storms that will prevent us from losing our way
103, this book’s argument in a nutshell is that trump extreme as he is is less an aberration than a logical conclusiona pastiche of pretty much all the worst trends of the past half century
104,trump is the product of powerful systems of thought that rank human life based on race religion gender sexuality physical appearance and physical ability and that have systematically used race as a weapon to advance brutal economic policies since the earliest days of north american colonization and the transatlantic slave trade
105,he is also the personification of the merger of humans and corporationsa oneman megabrand whose wife and children are spinoff brands with all the pathologies and conflicts of interest inherent in that
106,he is the embodiment of the belief that money and power provide license to impose one’s will on others whether that entitlement is expressed by grabbing women or grabbing the finite resources from a planet on the cusp of catastrophic warming
107,he is the product of a business culture that fetishizes “disruptors” who make their fortunes by flagrantly ignoring both laws and regulatory standards
108,most of all he is the incarnation of a stillpowerful freemarket ideological projectone embraced by centrist parties as well as conservative onesthat wages war on everything public and commonly held and imagines corporate ceos as superheroes who will save humanity
109,in 2002 george w bush threw a ninetiethbirthday party at the white house for the man who was the intellectual architect of that war on the public sphere the radical freemarket economist milton friedman
110,at the celebration then us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld declared “milton is the embodiment of the truth that ideas have consequences” he was right and donald trump is a direct consequence of those ideas
111,in this sense there is an important way in which trump is not shocking
112,he is the entirely predictable indeed clichéd outcome of ubiquitous ideas and trends that should have been stopped long ago
113,which is why even if this nightmarish presidency were to end tomorrow the political conditions that produced it and which are producing replicas around the world will remain to be confronted
114,with us vice president mike pence or house speaker paul ryan waiting in the wings and a democratic party establishment also enmeshed with the billionaire class the world we need won’t be won just by replacing the current occupant of the oval office
115,about that word we  as you read you may notice that i sometimes say we about the united states and sometimes about canada
116,one reason for that is pretty simple
117,i am a citizen of both countries with deep ties and relationships on both sides of the border
118,my parents are american and my extended family all lives in the united states
119,but i was raised in canada and i choose to live here
120,on election night i got a text from my father “aren’t you glad we already moved to canada” most of my journalism however and much of my political work is in the states where i’ve participated in countless meetings and debates about how we can collectively rise to the responsibility of this moment
121,another reason i sometimes say we about the us has nothing to do with passports
122,the fact is the us presidency impacts everyone on earth
123,no one is fully protected from the actions of the world’s largest economy the planet’s secondlargest emitter of greenhouse gases and the nation with the world’s largest military arsenal
124,those on the receiving end of trump’s missiles and monstrous bombs bear the greatest burdens and risks by far
125,but with powers so vast and policies so reckless everyone on this planet is potentially in the blast zone the fallout zone and certainly in the warming zone
126,there’s no one story that can explain everything about how we arrived at this juncture no one blueprint for how to fix thingsour world is far too braided and complicated for that
127,this is but one attempt to look at how we got to this surreal political moment how in concrete ways it could get a lot worse and how if we keep our heads we might just be able to flip the script and arrive at a radically better future
128,to get started we first need to understand what we’re saying no to because that no on the cover is not just to an individual or even a group of individuals though it is that too
129,we’re also saying no to the system that has elevated them to such heights
130,and then let’s move to a yesa yes that will bring about change so fundamental that today’s corporate takeover will be relegated to a historical footnote a warning to our kids
131,and donald trump and his fellow travelers will be seen for what they are a symptom of a deep sickness one that we decided collectively to come together and heal
132,note a small portion of the writing here has appeared in previous essays books and speeches the vast majority however is appearing for the first time

137,“beyond vietnam” 1967 chapter one how trump won by becoming the ultimate brand the night donald trump was declared the winner of the 2016 election and fortyfifth president of the united states was particularly disorienting for me because it wasn’t a night at all
138,i was in sydney australia on a lecture tour and because of the time difference it was late morning on wednesday november 9 where i was
139,for almost everyone in my life it was tuesday night and friends were sending texts from drunken electionnight viewing parties
140,but for australians it was the start of a normal workday which for me just contributed to the overall feeling of vertigo when the results started coming in
141,at the time i was in a meeting with around fifteen heads of various australian environmental labor and social justice organizations
142,we were having a discussion that circled around a key insight
143,up to now the fights against global warming racism inequality violations of indigenous migrant and women’s rights as well as many other progressive battles have often been broken up into their own boxes or silos
144,but we had been asking as so many movements are today how do they intersect
145,what root causes connect them
146,how can these issues be tackled in tandem at the same time
147,what values would govern such a movement
148,and how could it translate into political power
149,with a group of colleagues i had been working on how to build that kind of crossmovement “people’s platform” in north america through a project called the leap manifestowhich i’ll come back to in the final chapterand there were many australian groups who were interested in exploring a similar approach
150,for the first hour or so it was a pretty upbeat meeting with lots of excitement about what was possible
151,people were feeling totally relaxed about the us elections
152,like many progressives and liberals and even many traditional conservatives we were sure trump would lose
153,then everyone’s phones started to buzz
154,and the room grew quieter and quieter and everyone around the lightfilled boardroom began to look increasingly panicked
155,all of a sudden the reason for gathering the idea that we could help spark an integrated leap forward on climate action racial justice decent jobs and morefelt utterly absurd
156,it was as if everyone instantly understood without even having to speak that we were about to be blasted backward by a gale force wind and all we could do now was try to hold our ground
157,the idea of forward momentum on any one of the pressing crises on the table seemed to evaporate before our eyes
158,then without anyone calling it to a close the meeting dispersed with colleagues barely saying goodbye to one another
159,cnn was calling out like some sort of irresistible homing device and we all silently went in search of bigger screens
160,most us voters did not cast a ballot for donald trump hillary clinton received nearly 29 million more votes a fact that continues to torment the sitting president
161,that he won at all is the result of an electoral college system originally designed to protect the power of slave owners
162,and on the rest of the planet overwhelming majorities of people told pollsters that if they had been magically able to vote in this pivotal election they would have cast a ballot for clinton
163,a notable exception to this global trend was russia where trump enjoyed strong support
164,within this very large antitrump camp we all have different stories about how we felt on that nightday
165,for many the defining emotion was shock that this could happen in the united states
166,for a great many others it was grief at seeing longheld knowledge about the depth of us racism and misogyny so vividly confirmed
167,for others the feeling was one of loss at watching the first female candidate for united states president lose her chance to become a role model for their children
168,still others were flooded with feelings of rage that such a compromised candidate was ever put forward against trump in the first place
169,and for millions inside the us and out the primary emotion was feara raw bodily knowledge that trump’s presidency would act as a catalyst to unleash extreme acts of racism violence and oppression
170,many people experienced a mixture of these emotions and more
171,and many also understood that this election result was not only about one man in one country
172,trump is but one strand of a seemingly global contagion
173,we are seeing a surge of authoritarian xenophobic farright politicsfrom marine le pen in france to narendra modi in india to rodrigo duterte in the philippines to the uk independence party to recep tayyip erdoğan in turkey and all of their counterparts some explicitly neofascist threatening to take power around the world
174,the reason i am sharing my own experience of election daynight in sydney is that i can’t shake the feeling that there is something important to learn from the way trump’s win was able to cut short our conversation how it severed plans for a forwardlooking agenda without so much as a debate
175,it was perfectly understandable that we all felt that way on election day
176,but if we accept the premise that from here on in the battles are all defense all about holding our ground against trumpstyle regressive attacks then we will end up in a very dangerous place indeed
177,because the ground we were on before trump was elected is the ground that produced trump
178,ground many of us understood to constitute a social and ecological emergency even without this latest round of setbacks
179,of course the attacks coming from trump and his kindred demagogues around the world need resisting fiercely
180,but we cannot spend the next four years only playing defense
181,the crises are all so urgent they won’t allow us that lost time
182,on one issue i know a fair amount about climate change humanity has a finite window in which to act after which protecting anything like a stable climate becomes impossible
183,and as we’ll see in chapter 4  that window is closing fast
184,so we need somehow to fight defense and offense simultaneously to resist the attacks of the present day and to find space to build the future we need
185,to say no and yes at the same time
186,but before we can get to what we want instead of trump and all that he and his administration represent we need to take an unflinching look at where we are and how we got here as well as how things will likely get a lot worse in the short term
187,and with respect to the latter be advised the doom is pretty persuasive
188,but we can’t let it be debilitating
189,mapping this territory is tough but it’s the only way to avoid repeating past mistakes and arrive at lasting solutions
190,not a transition but a corporate coup what donald trump’s cabinet of billionaires and multimillionaires represents is a simple fact the people who already possess an absolutely obscene share of the planet’s wealth and whose share grows greater year after yearthe latest figure from oxfam shows eight men are worth as much as half the worldare determined to grab still more
191,according to nbc news in december 2016 trump’s picks for cabinet appointments had a staggering combined net worth of 145 billion not including “special adviser” carl icahn who’s worth more than 15 billion on his own
192,moreover the key figures who populate trump’s cabinet are more than just a representative sample of the ultrarich
193,to an alarming extent he has collected a team of individuals who made their personal fortunes by knowingly causing harm to some of the most vulnerable people on the planet and to the planet itself often in the midst of crisis
194,it almost appears to be some sort of job requirement
195,there’s junk banker steve mnuchin trump’s treasury secretary once chairman and lead investor in “foreclosure machine” onewest which kicked tens of thousands of people out of their homes after the 2008 financial collapse
196,there’s trump’s secretary of state rex tillerson former ceo of exxonmobil the largest private oil company in the world
197,the company he headed bankrolled and amplified junk climate science for decades and lobbied fiercely behind the scenes against meaningful international climate action all while figuring out how exxon could profit from a warming world
198,and there are also military and surveillance contractors and paid lobbyists who make up a staggering number of trump’s defense and homeland security appointments
199,we were on a roll it can be easy to forget but before trump’s election upset regular people were standing up to battle injustices represented by many of these very industries and political forces and they were starting to win
200,bernie sanders’s surprisingly powerful presidential campaign though ultimately unsuccessful had wall street fearing for its bonuses and had won significant changes to the official platform of the democratic party
201,black lives matter and say her name were forcing a national debate about systemic antiblack racism and militarized policing and had helped win a phaseout of private prisons and reductions in the number of incarcerated americans
202,by 2016 no major sporting or cultural eventfrom the oscars to the super bowl could take place without some recognition of how the conversation about race and state violence had changed
203,women’s movements were turning sexual violence into a frontpage issue shining a spotlight on “rape culture” changing the conversation about highprofile men accused of sexual crimes like bill cosby and helping force the ouster of roger ailes from the top job at fox news where he was accused of sexually harassing more than two dozen women allegations he denies
204,the climate movement was also on a roll winning victory after victory against oil pipelines natural gas fracking and arctic drilling very often with resurgent indigenous communities in the lead
205,and more victories were on the way the climate accord negotiated in paris in 2015 contained commitments to keep temperatures at a level that would require trillions of dollars’ worth of extremely profitable fossil fuel assets to stay in the ground
206,for a company like exxonmobil a realization of those goals was an existential threat
207,and as the meeting i attended in sydney suggested there was a growing understanding in the united states and beyond that the pressing task ahead was to connect the dots among these movements in order to build a common agenda and with it a winning progressive coalitionone grounded in an ethic of deep social inclusion and planetary care
208,the trump administration far from being the story of one dangerous and outrageous figure should be understood partly in this contextas a ferocious backlash against the rising power of overlapping social and political movements demanding a more just and safer world
209,rather than risk the possibility of further progress and further lost profits this gang of predatory lenders planet destabilizing polluters war and “security” profiteers joined forces to take over the government and protect their illgotten wealth
210,after decades of seeing the public sphere privatized in bits and pieces trump and his appointees have now seized control of the government itself
211,the takeover is complete
212,granting the corporate wish list in the face of his total lack of government experience trump sold himself to voters with a somewhat novel twopronged pitch
213,first i’m so rich that i don’t need to be bought off
214,and second you can trust me to fix this corrupt system because i know it from the insidei gamed it as a businessman i bought politicians i dodged taxes i outsourced production
215,so who better than me and my equally rich friends to drain the swamp
216,not surprisingly something else has occurred
217,trump and his cabinet of former executives are remaking government at a startling pace to serve the interests of their own businesses their former businesses and their tax bracket as a whole
218,within hours of taking office trump called for a massive tax cut which would see corporations pay just 15 percent down from 35 percent and pledged to slash regulations by 75 percent
219,his tax plan includes a range of other breaks and loopholes for very wealthy people like the ones inhabiting his cabinet not to mention himself
220,he appointed his son inlaw jared kushner to head up a “swat team” stacked with corporate executives who have been tasked with finding new regulations to eliminate new programs to privatize and new ways to make the us government “run like a great american company” according to an analysis by public citizen trump met with at least 190 corporate executives in less than three months in officebefore announcing that visitor logs would no longer be made public
221,pushed on what the administration had accomplished of substance in its first months budget director mick mulvaney cited trump’s hail of executive orders and stressed this “most of these are laws and regulations getting rid of other laws
222,regulations getting rid of other regulations” that they are
223,trump and his team are set to detonate programs that protect children from environmental toxins have told gas companies they no longer need to report all of the powerful greenhouse gases they are spewing and are pushing dozens and dozens of measures along the same lines
224,this is in short a great unmaking
225,which is why trump and his appointees are laughing at the feeble objections over conflicts of interestthe whole thing is a conflict of interest
226,that’s the point
227,and for no one more than donald trump a man who has merged so completely with his corporate brand that he is clearly unable to tell where one stops and the other begins
228,one of the most remarkable aspects of the trump presidency so far is the emergence of mara lago trump’s personal resort in palm beach as a carnivalesque membersonly allforprofit “winter white house” it was even briefly advertised as such on state department websites
229,one club member told the new york times that going to maralago was like “going to disneyland and knowing mickey mouse will be there all day long”only in this exercise in fullcontact branding it’s not disneyland but americaland and the president of the united states is mickey mouse
230,the ultimate brand bully when i read that quote i realized that if i was going to try to understand this presidency i’d have to do something i’d resisted for a long time delve back into the world of corporate marketing and branding that was the subject of my first book no logo 
231,the book focused on a key moment in corporate historywhen behemoths such as nike and apple stopped thinking of themselves primarily as companies that make physical products and started thinking of themselves first and foremost as manufacturers of brands
232,it was in the brandingwhich manufactured a sense of tribal identity that they believed their fortunes lay
233,forget factories
234,forget needing to maintain a huge workforce
235,once they realized that their biggest profits flowed from manufacturing an image these “hollow brands” came to the conclusion that it didn’t really matter who made their products or how little they were paid
236,they left that to the contractors a development with devastating repercussions for workers at home and abroad and one that was also fueling a new wave of anticorporate resistance
237,researching no logo had required four years of total immersion in branded culturefour years of watching and rewatching super bowl ads scouring advertising age for the latest innovations in corporate synergy reading souldestroying business books on how to get in touch with your personal brand values making excursions to niketowns visiting asian sweatshops going to monster malls to branded towns heading out on nighttime billboard raids with ad busters and culture jammers
238,some of it was funi’m far from immune to the allure of good marketing
239,but by the end it was as if i had passed some kind of tolerance threshold and developed a condition close to a brand allergy
240,if starbucks had come up with a new way to “unbrand” their stores or victoria’s secret had appropriated indigenous headdresses on the runway i didn’t want to write about iti had moved on and left that rapacious world behind
241,the trouble is to understand trump you really have to understand the world that made him what he is and that to a very large extent is the world of branding
242,he reflects all the worst trends i wrote about in no logo  from shrugging off responsibility for the workers who make your products via a web of often abusive contractors to the insatiable colonial need to mark every available space with your name
243,which is why i decided to delve back into that glossy world to see what it could tell us about how donald trump rose to the world’s most powerful job and maybe even what it was saying about the state of politics more broadly
244,transcending the world of things the rise of the superbrands like the one trump built around his brash persona has its roots in a single seemingly innocuous idea developed by management theorists in the mid1980s that to be successful corporations must primarily produce brands as opposed to products
245,until that time although it was understood in the corporate world that bolstering one’s brand name through advertising was important the primary concern of every solid manufacturer was the production of goods
246,as a 1938 editorial in fortune magazine put it “the basic and irreversible function of an industrial economy is the making of thingsit is in the factory and on the land and under the land that purchasing power originates” but by the 1980s sales of classic brandname goods like tide levi’s and marlboro had begun to falter
247,the problem seemed to be that the market was flooded with nearly identical products and with the economy in recession many were making decisions based on price not brand name
248,the old tricksbillboards tv adsdidn’t seem to be working anymore it was as if consumers had built up some sort of resistance
249,or as ad executive david lubars memorably put it consumers “are like roachesyou spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while” at around this same time a new kind of corporation began to rival the traditional allamerican manufacturers for market share
250,these were the nikes and apples and later the tommy hilfigers and starbucks and so on
251,these pioneers had a different model create a transcendent idea or brand surrounding your company
252,use it to connect with consumers who share its values
253,then charge a steep premium for products that are less about the objects themselves than about the profound human desire to be part of a tribe a circle of belonging
254,so when kids lined up all night to buy 250 nike sneakers they weren’t exactly buying the sneakers they were buying the idea of “just do it” and the dream of michael jordan who had become a oneman superbrand a term first used to describe the athlete’s growing empire
255,when their parents bought apple computers they were bringing home a piece of a deeply optimistic vision of the future captured in the slogan “think different” the aura of authenticity increased with each revolutionary and artistic icon living or dead whose face graced the campaign gandhi martin luther king picasso mandela the dalai lama
256,and when commuters were suddenly paying four times what they used to for a cup of coffee it was because starbucks wasn’t really selling coffee it was selling according to its ceo the idea of the “third place” not home not work
257,the third place used to be actual community spaces where people would gather without the help of corporations but those spaces were fast disappearing
258,another key development in this period was the notion that since the true product was the brand it could be projected onto any number of seemingly unconnected physical commodities
259,ralph lauren launched a line of paints virgin went into wedding dresses and colas starbucks had a line of jazz cds
260,the possibilities seemed endless
261,many of these highly branded companies made the then bold claim that producing goods was only an incidental part of their operations and that thanks to recent victories in trade liberalization and labor law reform they could have their products produced for them at bargainbasement prices by contractors and subcontractors many of them overseas
262,it didn’t really matter who did the physical work because the real value lay not in manufacturing but in design innovation and of course marketing
263,a consensus soon emerged at the management level that a great many corporations that did not embrace this model were bloated oversized they owned too much employed too many people and were weighed down with too many things
264,the oldfashioned process of producingrunning one’s own factories being responsible for tens of thousands of fulltime permanent employeesbegan to look less like the route to success and more like a clunky liability
265,the goal was to become a hollowbrandown little brand everything
266,pretty soon multinationals were competing in a race toward weightlessness whoever owned the least had the fewest employees on the payroll and produced the most powerful images as opposed to things won the race
267,no space few jobs the meteoric rise of this business model had two immediate impacts
268,our culture became more and more crowded with marketing as brands searched out fresh space and new “brand extensions” with which to project their big ideas and reach their target markets
269,work and workers on the other hand experienced a sharp discounting and were treated as increasingly disposable
270,brands like nike and adidas competed fiercely in the marketing sphere and yet they manufactured their products in some of the same factories with the same workers stitching their shoes
271,and why not
272,making stuff was no longer considered a “core competency” head offices now increasingly being called “campuses” wanted to be as free as possible to focus on what they considered the real business at hand creating a corporate mythology powerful enough to project meaning onto pretty much any object simply by stamping their brand on it
273,in the press this phenomenon was often reported as company x or y deciding to move their factories to a part of the world where labor was cheaper
274,but as i found when i visited sweatshops producing namebrand goods like gap clothing and ibm computers in indonesia and the philippines the truth was somewhat different
275,in most cases these companies were not moving their factories in north america and europe and reopening them in asia but rather closing them down and never reopening them anywhere
276,this period saw a proliferation of very complex supply chains where it became increasingly difficult to sort out where a product was being produced and by whom
277,it also saw a wave of scandals again and again intrepid investigative journalists and labor groups would reveal that say a michael jordan–branded nike shoe or a disneybranded tshirt was being made under horrific sweatshop conditions in haiti or indonesia
278,but when journalists or consumers tried to hold the brand accountable the company would almost invariably declare “we’re as horrified as you are
279,which is why we’re going to stop doing business with that contractor” it’s no secret why this model took off
280,if you did it rightif you made beautiful commercials invested heavily in design and tried to embody your brand identity through countless sponsorship arrangements and crosspromotionsmany people were willing to pay almost anything for your products
281,which is why the success of what came to be called “lifestyle brands” set off a kind of mania with brands competing with one another over who had the most expansive network of brand extensions or who could create the most immersive 3d experiences chances for customers to crawl inside and merge with their favorite brands
282,so what does all this 1990s history have to do with donald trump
283,a great deal
284,trump built an empire by following this formula precisely
285,and then as a candidate he figured out how to profit from the rage and despair it left behind in communities that used to do the kind of wellpaid manufacturing that companies like his long ago abandoned
286,it’s quite a con
287,the trump show in the eighties when trump first became a national figure he was still a fairly traditional real estate developer who happened to have a bottomless desire to see his own name in print and pretty much everywhere else
288,he splashed his name on buildings around new york and atlantic city he worked the press relentlessly and he turned his relationship with his wife and mistress into a liveaction soap opera
289,as a result trump punched above his weight in terms of visibility his face gazed off the cover of magazines from time to gq 
290,he landed cameos in hollywood films and tv shows
291,and he understood something essential about branding early on
292,as he told playboy  “the show is trump and it is soldout performances everywhere” even so the core of his business remained conventional acquiring real estate and running those buildings whether hotels or condo towers or casinos
293,in the nineties that started to change mostly because trump had so mismanaged his atlantic city casinos that his bankers were taking over more and more of his business even before he had his first few bankruptcies under his belt
294,he didn’t lose total control over his properties though
295,investors appeared to be convinced that they needed the trump namehis personal brandto keep the house of cards from crashing down
296,and that proved an important lesson in the realworld value of a studiously promoted name
297,even though he was still primarily a builder trump had seen the way companies like nike were making a killing on the hollowbrand model
298,and gradually he followed suit
299,at the start his innovation was that he branded a part of the economy that had never been branded before highend real estate
300,obviously there were global branded hotel and resort chains before
301,but trump pioneered the idea that where you work an office tower where you live a condominium and where you play your golf club or vacation destination would all be franchises of a single global luxury brand
302,much like celebration floridadisney’s fully branded towntrump was selling the opportunity for people to live inside his brand 247
303,the real breakthrough however came when mark burnett head of a reality tv empire pitched trump on the idea of the apprentice 
304,up until then trump had been busy coping with the fallout from his bankruptcies and the impatience of his bankers
305,now out of the blue he was being offered a chance to leap into the stratosphere of superbrands those rarefied companies earning their enormous profits primarily by building up their brand meaning and then projecting it hither and yon liberated from the burden of having to make their own productsor in trump’s case build his own buildings
306,he understood the potential immediately
307,because the show would put the brightest possible spotlight on his gilded lifestyle with long lingering shots of his palatial homes and his luxury jets it would do wonders to solidify his decadeslong mission to equate the name trump with material success
308,before the first episode even aired he was already lining up deals to license his name for a menswear line
309,he told the network’s publicist that even if the apprentice “doesn’t get ratings it’s still going to be great for my brand” but it did get ratingsimpressive ones
310,and pretty soon he had launched a complete menu of spinoff brandsfrom trump cologne to trump water to trump eyewear to trump mattresses to trump university
311,as far as the current president of the united states was concerned there was no category of product that couldn’t be brought into the trumpbranded bubble
312,most importantly with the apprentice  trump wasn’t paying as other brands do to have his brand featured in a hit network tv show he was getting paid a fortune for priceless free advertising
313,more than that his shows collected millions by promoting other brands
314,in april 2011 for example the celebrity apprentice was paid to promote more products on the air than any other show 120 product placements in all
315,this is the mark of a true superbrand trump built a brand that contains brand multitudes
316,and in bringing his children into the show he even began to breed brands
317,after you have pulled off a feat like that what’s your next trick
318,merge your brand with the ultimate symbol of power and authority the white house
319,oligarch chic but before that could happen trump needed one more thing to complete his transformation
320,he radically changed the core of his business real estate
321,rather than building and owning the structures himself as he had earlier in his career trump realized that he could make far easier money simply by selling his name to developers around the world who would use his celebrity to attract buyers and customers for their office buildings condos and hotels
322,the outside developers would do the construction and carry all the liabilities
323,if the projects failed as they frequently did trump still collected his licensing fee
324,and the fees were enormous
325,according to the washington post  on a single hotelcondo project in panama “trump has earned at least 50 million on the project on virtually zero investment” he still owns a few flagship properties including trump tower in new york and maralago in florida
326,but if you look at the broader network of a great many trumpbranded propertiesfrom the trump international golf club in dubai to the many other trump properties in india canada brazil south korea and new york citywhat you see is that trump either doesn’t own them himself or owns just a piece of them
327,his revenue comes from leasing his name
328,a large part of trump’s international success was timing
329,he entered the global highend real estate market at a time when an unprecedented amount of untaxed private wealth was sloshing around looking for safe places to park as it still is
330,according to james s henry a senior advisor with the ukbased tax justice network in 2015 the estimated private financial wealth of individuals stashed unreported in tax havens around the globe was somewhere between 24 trillion and 36 trillion
331,gilded condos with a flashy aesthetic pitched perfectly to newly minted oligarchs from moscow to colombia fit the bill perfectly
332,but trump’s market wasn’t just the rich
333,his apprentice era brand empire allowed him to appeal to wealthy and middleincome consumers simultaneously
334,for the wellheeled and flashy there was membership at his beach and golf clubs or a unit in a trumpbranded tower with furnishings from the trump homeware collection
335,for the masses who don’t have that kind of cash trump auctioned off little pieces of the dreama glossy red trump tie a trump steak a trump book
336,you are all fired
337,trump won the white house on a campaign that railed ceaselessly against the loss of manufacturing jobsthe same kind of jobs he has outsourced at virtually every opportunity
338,as a businessman he took full advantage of the outsourcing economy as does ivanka’s company
339,and unsurprisingly there have been major investigative reports detailing the appalling conditions under which trump’s ties are made in shengzhou china for instance and the even worse conditions in the chinese factories producing ivanka’s line of footwear
340,in april 2017 the fair labor association a watchdog that grew out of the sweatshop scandals in the nineties issued a report disclosing that workers in a factory in china producing for a major supplier of ivanka’s dresses and blouses put in close to 60 hours a week and earned what works out to a little over 1 an hour well below the average wage for urban chinese manufacturing workers
341,most employees also lacked health and maternity benefitsnot a good look for an advocate of women in the workforce
342,the construction of many trumpbranded hotels and towers has been plagued with similar controversies in the us and abroad
343,an investigation by vice  for instance revealed that the treatment of migrant workers constructing a trumpbranded golf course in dubai stood out even in a city notorious for slavelike labor conditions
344,ben anderson who produced the report describes worker dorms in which “guys live 21 to a room with rats running around above them” and bathrooms that “didn’t look fit for human beings” the trump organization issued a statement about its “zero tolerance policy for unlawful labor practices at any project bearing the ‘trump’ name” needless to say this particular project was being built by an outside company trump had just leased his name
345,some brands would have been badly battered by these types of revelations
346,the trump organization just shrugs them off
347,and that has everything to do with the big branding idea around which donald trump chose to build his empire
348,immune to scandal trump publicly defines his brand identity as quality and luxury
349,but that’s a sleight of hand trump hotels and resorts don’t even make it into the top ten luxury accommodation brands in the world lists that reliably include names such as four seasons and oberoi as if to underline the point maralago was cited for nearly a dozen food safety violations in january 2017
350,the truth which doesn’t sound nearly as glamorous is that the trump brand stands for wealth itself or to put it more crassly money
351,that’s why its aesthetics are dynasty meetslouis xiv
352,it’s why trump’s relationship to gold is the inverse of superman’s relationship to kryptonite trump crumples when he is more than three feet away from something big and shiny
353,donald trump’s personal brand is slightly different but intimately related
354,his brand is being the ultimate boss the guy who is so rich he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants and to whomever he wants including grabbing whichever woman he wants by whichever body part he wants
355,this helps explain why signifiers of trump’s wealth are so important to him
356,gold curtains and shots of his private jets are how trump constantly reinforces his brand as the ultimate capitalist success story power and wealth incarnate
357,it’s why he placed his personal wealth however exaggerated at the center of his campaign for president
358,it’s also why no labor scandal is ever going to stick to him
359,in the world he has created he’s just acting like a “winner” if someone gets stepped on they are obviously a loser
360,and this doesn’t only apply to labor scandalsvirtually every traditional political scandal bounces off trump
361,that’s because trump didn’t just enter politics as a socalled outsider somebody who doesn’t play by the rules
362,he entered politics playing by a completely different set of rulesthe rules of branding
363,according to those rules you don’t need to be objectively good or decent you only need to be true and consistent to the brand you have created
364,that’s why brand managers are so obsessed with discipline and repetition once you have identified what your core brand is your only job is to embody that brand project that brand and repeat its message
365,if you stay focused very little can touch you
366,that’s a problem when applied to a sitting us president especially because over many many years and with a startling level of consistency donald trump created a brand that is entirely amoral
367,on the campaign trail trump was able to shrug off almost every conventional “gotcha” caught dodging federal taxes
368,that’s just being “smart” wouldn’t reveal his tax returns
369,who’s going to make him
370,he was only half joking on the campaign trail when he said “i could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldn’t lose any voters” in trump’s world impunity even more than lots of gold is the ultimate signifier of success
371,this has grave implications for any hope of preventing this administration from acting as an open kleptocracy
372,but as we will see in the next chapter there are ways to pierce trump’s brand bubble
373,you just have to know where to place the needle
374,chapter two the first family of brands donald trump may never have thought he had a chance of winning the white house very few people did
375,but after he won the republican nomination he clearly realized he had the ultimate branding tool within reach the us presidency
376,every single minute he is president his brand value and the value of his ongoing businesses is increasing and he is therefore directly and significantly profiting from public officeprecisely what conflictofinterest rules are designed to prevent
377,so now we are in entirely uncharted territory because let’s face it human megabrands are a relatively new phenomenon
378,there’s no rulebook that foresaw any of this
379,people keep askingis he going to divest
380,is he going to sell his businesses
381,is ivanka going to
382,but it’s not at all clear what these questions even mean because their primary businesses are their names
383,you can’t disentangle trump the man from trump the brand those two entities merged long ago
384,every time he sets foot in one of his propertiesa golf club a hotel a beach club white house press corps in tow he is increasing his overall brand value which allows his company to sell more memberships rent more rooms and increase fees
385,the logic of how the trump family sees the relationship between branding and political office was laid bare in the lawsuit melania trump launched just before she became first lady
386,she demanded 150 million in damages from the company that owns the daily mail website for falsely implying she worked in the past as an escort
387,and she had every right to sue for damages for that
388,but what was the basis for saying she had lost a staggering 150 million given that she barely has a business of her own
389,the core of her legal case was that as first lady she would have builtin the futurea valuable brand “in multiple product categories each of which could have garnered multimilliondollar business relationships for a multiyear term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world” the daily mail settled apologizing to trump and paying out an undisclosed sum
390,it’s not unprecedented for first wives to parlay their political profile into a lifestyle brand
391,samantha cameron wife of david waited just five months after her husband stepped down as british prime minister before announcing her own “working women” clothing line
392,but what is striking about melania’s nowsettled lawsuit is that she seemed to be trying to skip the stage of actually launching a serious brand and instead went straight to claiming the money
393,moreover those original court filings make plain how the trumps see public office as a short term investment to enormously swell the value of your commercial brand in the long run
394,we can also see this with ivanka whose products have notoriously been hawked by taxpayerfunded public employees including her father via twitter and his adviser kellyanne conway who went on national television to do what she described as a “commercial” telling viewers to “go buy ivanka’s stuff” the conflicts tipped into self parody on april 6 2017 when the associated press reported “ivanka trump’s company won provisional approval from the chinese government for three new trademarks giving it monopoly rights to sell ivanka brand jewellery bags and spa services in the world’s second largest economy” but that’s not the only thing that happened that day
395,“that night the first daughter and her husband jared kushner sat next to the president of china and his wife for a steak and dover sole dinner at maralago” a political summit whose details had been arranged by none other than jared kushner
396,asked about these kinds of conflicts ivanka invariably stresses that just as her father has supposedly distanced himself from the trump organization by putting it in the hands of his sons while he still collects the profits ivanka has put her company in the hands of “independent trustees”her husband’s brother and sister while she still collects the profits
397,this goes well beyond nepotism it’s the us government as a forprofit family business
398,we know that trump’s presidency has made the family of brands more valuable because ivanka’s business reported record sales after kellyanne conway made her televised pitch
399,maralago has already increased its membership fees to 200000 a year from 100000
400,and why not
401,now for your fee you might find yourself witnessing a highstakes conversation about national security over dinner
402,you might get to hobnob with a visiting head of state
403,you might even get to witness trump announcing that he has just launched an air assault on a foreign country
404,and of course you might even get to meet the president himself and have the chance to quietly influence him
405,no public records are kept of who comes and goes from the club so who knows
406,for decades trump has been selling the allure of proximity to wealth and powerit is the meaning of his brand
407,but now he’s able to offer to his paying customers the real deal
408,trump’s ownership of maralago is telling in itself
409,a decade before trump purchased the property in 1985 the owner of the estate socialite marjorie merriweather post had bequeathed it to the us government in the hopes that it could be used as a presidential retreat or a “winter white house” but no president used it and it was eventually returned
410,long before the 2016 election trump had enjoyed boasting about the fact that he lived in a house intended for presidents
411,indeed in retrospect it is as if he was playing at being president for three decades
412,and now with the 2016 elections that fantasy has become a realityor is it reality that has been swallowed whole by trump’s fantasy
413,as with all things trump it’s genuinely difficult to tell
414,trump may call his palm beach estate the “winter white house” or the “southern white house” but it is of course no such thing
415,the white house is a public institution maralago remains a private forprofit membersonly club with the proceeds flowing directly to trump and his family
416, any president who refused to sell his business would face potential conflicts of interest since the actions of the us government can impact everything from stock prices to as we will see in a couple of chapters the price of oil
417,but brandbased companies like trump’s are different beasts entirely
418,the conflicts of interest are not only tied to specific policies or actions
419,rather the conflicts are omnipresent and continuous embedded in the mere fact of trump being president
420,that’s because the value of lifestyle brands fluctuates wildly depending on the space they occupy in the culture
421,so anything that increases donald trump’s visibility and the perception of him as allpowerful actively increases the value of the trump brand and therefore increases how much clients will pay to be associated with itto slap it on their new condo development say or on a smaller scale to play on his golf courses or buy one of his ties
422,and there is no sign that trump is backing off exploiting that fact to its fullest advantage
423,according to a new york times report in april 2017 “mr
424,trump’s enterprise now run by his two adult sons has 157 trademark applications pending in 36 countries” what exactly are the trump boys selling
425,in january 2017 donald trump’s son eric went on a trip to uruguay to meet with a developer who is buying the right to use the trump name on his new tower
426,at the time the public scandal was how much us taxpayers’ money went to pay for the secret service and other government staff who traveled with eric on that trip around 100000 in hotel costs a direct public subsidy to trump’s private dealings
427,but the deeper scandal is what they were in uruguay to promote the trump brand which had just been made so much more valuable by the fact that its owner was about to be sworn in as us president
428,and this says nothing about the potential for corruption which is dizzying
429,given that what the trump sonseric and donald jrare selling is ephemeral a name a buyer could pay 6 million for it or could pay 60 million
430,who’s to judge what constitutes a fair market value price
431,more worryingly who’s to say what services are being purchased when a private company pays millions to lease the trump brand
432,do they really think it’s that valuable to their condo tower or do they think that by throwing in an extra 5 million they might be looked on more favorably in other dealings that require a friendly relationship with the white house
433,it’s very difficult to see how any of this can be untangled
434,a brand is worth whatever buyers are willing to pay for it
435,that’s always been the appeal of building a business on this modelthat something as ephemeral as a name could be vested with such realworld monetary value
436,the trump organization has said it will not make any new deals for foreign properties to prevent an appearance of impropriety
437,but this isn’t just an international question
438,if a us city or state government grants a trump development a break on taxes or regulations are they really doing it because they think this particular business will help their communityor because they want something from the white house
439,same goes for any government or businessforeign or domesticthat chooses a trump property for an event or as a place for employees to stay
440,do they really think it’s the best option or are they trying to curry favor
441,what’s fascinating about these ethics questions is that they are so similar to the scandals surrounding the clinton foundation which may well have contributed to hillary’s electoral loss
442,there were many thorny questions about what a private company or foreign government thought they were getting when they made a hefty donation to the clinton foundation
443,were they being purely philanthropic moved by the scourge of infectious diseases and childhood obesity
444,or were they also making a calculation that their donation would pay some dividends because hillary clinton was secretary of state and looked likely to become the next us president
445,those were valid concerns and trump didn’t hesitate to raise them about his rival
446,but with the money the trump sons are collecting from leasing their father’s name and the favors they are negotiating the potential for influence peddling is of a different order we now have money flowing to the family of a sitting president not a projected president and with not even the pretext of philanthropy which the clinton foundation at least had
447,this is not to exonerate the clintons far from it
448,the decades bill and hillary spent blurring ethical lines at the foundation are part of what set the stage for trump to annihilate those lines altogether more on that in chapter 6 
449,reagan’s prophecy fulfilled a few months into the new administration the cover of the new yorker featured an illustration of trump whacking golf balls at the white house shattering window after window
450,it’s a striking image in large part because it slowly dawns that the broken windows are not at maralago or trump tower but the publicly owned building where trump’s own family has assiduously avoided living
451,and this points to a difficult truth
452,with every alleged ethics violation with every brazen lie with every deranged tweet this administration leaves the public sphere more broken and degraded
453,even if corruption or treason ultimately costs trump the white house what will be left behind will be wreckageproof of the fundamental premise of trump’s political project that government is not just a swamp it’s a burden
454,that there is nothing worth protecting
455,that private is better than public
456,and if that’s all true why not wreck the place before you leavefiguratively if not literally
457,it’s a reminder that trump’s political career would have been impossible without the degradation of the whole idea of the public sphere which has been unfolding over decades
458,it could never have happened without the idea that “government is not the solution it is the problem” as ronald reagan famously put it
459,and it could never have happened had that message not been followed up with decades of deregulation that essentially legalized bribery with outrageous sums of corporate money flowing into politics
460,it’s absolutely true that the system is corrupt
461,it is a swamp
462,and people know it
463,they know that the rewriting of the rules in favor of a small group of corporate interests and the one percent has been a bipartisan processthat it was bill clinton who deregulated the banks setting the stage for the 2008 collapse and it was obama who chose not to prosecute the bankers and that the democratic candidate running against trump would almost surely have done no different
464,sure it’s preposterous for a selfdescribed billionaire sitting on a golden throne to pass himself off as a savior of the working class
465,but a pitch as patently irrational as “trust me because i cheated the system” could only have sold to a significant portion of the american public because what passed for “business as usual” in washington well before trump looked a whole lot like corruption to everyone else
466,that’s why so many people have been happy to treat electoral politics as macabre entertainment
467,once politics has reached such a debased state why bother protecting it from a boor like trump
468,it’s a cesspool anyway so let the games begin
469,as a resident of toronto this is a pathology that i’ve lived through before
470,our former mayor rob ford was something of a municipal rehearsal for trump
471,ford who died in 2016 created a performancebased image that was impossible to shamebecause his brand was being shameless
472,even when he was caught on tape smoking crack it didn’t finish him off because it was still the wacky rob ford show and his supporters were his semiironic loyal audience taking it all in like a saturday night live sketch
473,but as with trump the overthetop performance and the personal scandals distracted from a sinister agenda a pseudopopulism that specialized in handouts to corporations a blank check for police and eroded services for the most vulnerable
474,i didn’t foresee branding culture going this far when i started writing about it twenty years ago
475,but i’m also not surprised
476,back then i saw branding as a colonial process it seeks to absorb ever more space and real estate and create a selfenclosed bubble
477,what’s extraordinary about donald trump’s presidency is that now we are all inside the trump branded world whether we want to be or not
478,we have all become extras in his forprofit reality tv show which has expanded to swallow the most powerful government in the world
479,is there any escape
480,the essential immorality of trump’s brand does present unique barriers to holding this administration accountable
481,and yet there is hope
482,in fact trump’s animating life forcethe quest for moneymay actually make him more vulnerable than any president before
483,jam the trump brand back when i published no logo  we used to call it “culture jamming” and the trick was always the same identify the big bold idea a company is selling and then expose the dirty reality behind the shine
484,the ability of consumers and activists to impact the behavior of a commercial brand has been demonstrated many times most recently by the successful campaign to push bill o’reilly off the air at fox news following revelations that he and his employer had paid out 13 million to settle sexual harassment allegations without admission of guilt
485,realizing that there was no shaming the o’reilly brand color of change a racial justice organization alongside several women’s groups took a backdoor approach they went after the show’s advertisers informing them that they were now considered accomplices in what seemed to be a longterm strategy of buying women’s silence
486,the advertisers heard the same from thousands of customers online and off and they began fleeing from the show in droves
487,within less than three weeks of the settlement revelations breaking in the new york times  and despite having the highest rated show on us cable news o’reilly was off the air though with a golden handshake reportedly worth as much as 25 million
488,the campaign showed that any brand can be jammed even one as defiantly amoral as trump’syou just need to understand its weak points
489,since trump’s personal brand is being “the boss” who does what he wants one way to mess with it is to make him look like a puppet
490,it doesn’t really matter who is yanking the strings
491,once they’re exposed trump’s carefully nurtured image begins to slip
492,and this tactic clearly works trump was driven so mad by the persistent jokes about presidentbannon that he took to twitter to proclaim himself the supreme decider and the status of his once allpowerful chief strategist seemed to rapidly decline
493,since the trump brand is all about having bags and bags of money the other way to jam it is to make him less rich
494,and as with the o’reilly strategy the best way to do that is by sending his branding empire into crisis
495,grabyourwallet the clearinghouse for boycotts of trump’s web of brands has been on this since before trump was elected and has successfully helped to pressure several chains to drop various trump brands
496,in the grand scheme of trump’s branding empire these are dents
497,the main source of revenue for the trump organization is selling and renting office and condo units and leasing trump’s name to real estate companies around the world
498,trump was clearly betting that being president would drive up the price
499,but what if he is proven wrong
500,what if he starts losing commercial renters because they are coming under pressure for their association with his brand several boycott campaigns like this are already under way
501,and what if developers come under so much public pressure that they decide having trump’s name on their façade is actually costing them revenue
502,already in new york city tenants of trump place demanded that their building manager take the trump name off their home
503,as one resident said she was tired of feeling “disgust” each time she walked into her building
504,the manager complied and trump’s name was removed
505,and when the trump sons went to vancouver to celebrate the opening of the latest trump temple they were met with protests and boycotts from local politicians
506,if these kinds of protests spread more developers could decide to detrump themselves
507,and it’s a fair bet that if his golden name starts disappearing off giant phallic symbols from vancouver to manila trump would not take it well nor would his sons who are reportedly already worried about the damage that senior advisors like steve bannon may have done to the family name
508,in a parallel tactic when the white house closed down its callin comment lines in january 2017 one group whitehouseincorg  suggested voters phone trump hotels and resorts and tell whoever answered that they were upset about the president’s plans to take away their health insurance or any other policy grievances they had
509,it was a smart tactic
510,tens of thousands reportedly made the calls and one month later the white house reopened the lines
511,if any of this seems unfair consider this the whole reason we expect politicians to divest their financial holdings or put them in a real blind trust is that having active business holdings while serving in office creates all kinds of opportunities for conflicts of interest and backdoor influence
512,trump has chosen not to divest
513,his adviser daughter has made the same choice
514,which is why it’s perfectly legitimate to use those choices to try to influence the hell out of them
515,if his branding empire loses enough revenue and his personal boss image is sufficiently battered trump might just coursecorrect on some of his more inflammatory policies
516,at the very least jamming his central pitch to voters“trust me i’m a successful billionaire”will hurt his chances in 2020 but before we get there we are all going to be subjected to a lot more of the trump show
517,chapter three the maralago hunger games ronald reagan was once asked what it was like to be president after being an actor and he reportedly said “how can a president not be an actor” you can imagine trump thinking the same thing about being a reality tv star
518,trump’s mastery of the genre was pivotal in the construction of his branded empire and it was essential to his successful run for president
519,and now trump is using those same skills he learned on the apprentice the belief that he can cut edit and reshape reality to fit a largely prescripted selfaggrandizing outcometo transform not just the white house but large parts of the world
520,the king of liveaction trickledown the colonization of network television by reality tv at the turn of the millennium happened at a speed that few could have predicted
521,in very short order north americans went from deriving entertainment from scripted shows with the same recurring characters and dramas week after week season after season to watching seemingly unscripted shows where the drama came from people’s willingness to eject one another from whatever simulation of reality happened to be on display
522,tens of millions were glued to their sets as participants were voted off the island on survivor  voted out of the mansion on the bachelor and eventually fired by donald trump
523,the timing makes sense
524,the first season of survivor so wildly successful that it spawned an army of imitatorswas in 2000 that was two decades after the “freemarket revolution” had been kicked into high gear by ronald reagan and margaret thatcher with its veneration of greed individualism and competition as the governing principles of society
525,it was now possible to peddle as mass entertainment the act of watching people turn on each other for a pot of gold
526,the whole genrethe alliances the backstabbing the one person left standingwas always a kind of capitalist burlesque
527,before the apprentice  however there was at least the pretext that it was about something else how to survive in the wilderness how to catch a husband how to be a housemate
528,with donald trump’s arrival the veneer was gone
529,the apprentice was explicitly about the race to survive in the cutthroat “jungle” of late capitalism
530,the first episode began with a shot of a homeless person sleeping rough on the streeta loser in other words
531,then the camera cut to trump in his limo living the dreamthe ultimate winner
532,the message was unmistakable you can be the homeless guy or you can be trump
533,that was the whole sadistic drama of the showplay your cards right and be the one lucky winner or suffer the abject humiliation of being berated and then fired by the boss
534,it was quite a cultural feat after decades of mass layoffs declining living standards and the normalization of extremely precarious employment mark burnett and donald trump delivered the coup de grâce they turned the act of firing people into mass entertainment
535,life’s a bitch every week to millions of viewers the apprentice delivered the central sales pitch of freemarket theory telling viewers that by unleashing your most selfish and ruthless side you are actually a hero creating jobs and fueling growth
536,don’t be nice be a killer
537,that’s how you help the economy and more importantly yourself
538,in later seasons the underlying cruelty of the show grew even more sadistic
539,the winning team lived in a luxurious mansiondrinking champagne in inflatable pool loungers zipping off in limos to meet celebrities
540,the losing team was deported to tents in the backyard nicknamed “trump trailer park” the tentdwellers whom trump gleefully deemed the “havenots” didn’t have electricity ate off paper plates and slept to the sounds of howling dogs
541,they would peek through a gap in the hedge to see what decadent wonders the “haves” were enjoying
542,in other words trump and burnett deliberately created a microcosm of the very real and everwidening inequalities outside the show the same injustices that have enraged many trump votersbut they played those inequalities for kicks turning them into a spectator sport
543,there was a slight hunger games quality to it though hemmed in by network television restrictions on nonsimulated violence
544,on one show trump told the tent team that “life’s a bitch” so they’d better do everything possible to step over the losers and become a winner like him
545,what’s interesting about this particular piece of televised class warfare which aired in 2007 is that the pretense sold to a previous generationcapitalism was going to create the best of all possible worldsis completely absent
546,no this is a system that generates a few big winners and hordes of losers so you’d better make damn sure you are on the winning team
547,this reflects the fact that for well over a decade now the ideological and intellectual side of the neoliberal project has been in severe crisis
548,in 2016 credit suisse estimated that there is roughly 256 trillion in total global wealthwith a staggeringly unequal distribution “while the bottom half collectively own less than 1 percent of total wealth the wealthiest top 10 percent own 89 percent of all global assets” which is why there just aren’t many serious people left who are willing to argue with a straight face that giving more to the wealthy is the best way to help the poor
549,trump’s pitch has always been different
550,from the start it was i will turn you into a winnerand together we can crush the losers
551,in a realworld nightmare dreams sell it’s worth remembering that trump’s breakthrough to national celebrity status came not via a real estate deal but a book about making real estate deals
552,the art of the deal  marketed as holding the secrets to fabulous financial wealth was published in 1987the peak of the reagan era
553,it was followed up over the years with crasser variations on the same theme think like a billionaire think big and kick ass trump 101  and how to get rich 
554,trump first started selling the notion that he held the ticket to joining the top one percent of income earners at the precise moment when many of the ladders that provided social mobility between classeslike free quality public educationwere being kicked away and just as the social safety net was being shredded
555,all of this meant that the drive to magically strike it rich to win big to make it to that safe economic stratum became increasingly frantic
556,trump who was born wealthy expertly profited off that desperation across many platforms but most infamously through trump university
557,in one ad for the scandalplagued and nowdefunct “university” actually a series of dodgy seminars in hotel meeting rooms trump declared “i can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor including you” and then there were the casinos a large chunk of trump’s us real estate portfolio
558,the dream at the center of the casino economy is not so different from the dream for sale at trump university or in how to get rich  you may be on the verge of personal bankruptcy today but if you literally play your cards right you could be living large by morning
559,this is central to how trump built his brand and amassed his wealth by selling the promise that “you too could be donald trump”at a time when life was becoming so much more precarious if you weren’t in the richest one percent
560,he then turned around and used that very same pitch to votersthat he would make america a country of winners againexploiting those deep economic anxieties and using all the realitysimulation skills that he had picked up from years at the helm of a toprated tv show
561,after decades of hawking howtoget rich manuals donald trump understands exactly how little needs to be behind the promisewhether on renegotiating trade deals or bringing back manufacturingif the desperation is great enough
562,reveling in the fake on the road to the white house well before trump’s rise elections had already crossed over into ratingsdriven infotainment on cable news
563,what trump did was to exponentially increase the entertainment factor and therefore the ratings
564,as a veteran of the form he understood that if elections had become a form of reality tv then the best contestant which is not the same thing as the best candidate would win
565,maybe they wouldn’t win the final vote but they would at least win walltowall coverage which from a branding perspective is still winning
566,as trump said when he was contemplating a presidential run in 2000 he decided against it “it’s very possible that i could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it” since the election we’ve heard a few mea culpas from media executives acknowledging that they helped trump’s electoral rise by giving him such an outsized portion of their coverage
567,and that’s true they helped enormously but the handwringing doesn’t go nearly far enough
568,they are also responsible because the biggest gift to trump was not just airtime but the entire infotainment model of covering elections which endlessly plays up interpersonal dramas between the candidates while largely abandoning the traditional journalistic task of delving into policy specifics and explaining how different candidates’ positions on issues such as health care and regulatory reform will play out in voters’ lives
569,the tyndall report found that through the entire election the three major nightly network news shows combined spent a total of just 32 minutes on “issues coverage”down from an already paltry 220 minutes in the 2008 election
570,the rest was the reality show of who said what about whom and who was leading which poll where
571,for millions of viewers the result was highly entertaining
572,which is likely why french media followed a markedly similar formula to cover its highstakes 2017 elections
573,this is worth underlining trump didn’t create the problemhe exploited it
574,and because he understood the conventions of fake reality better than anyone he took the game to a whole new level
575,fake fights real stakes trump didn’t just bring reality tv expertise to electoral politicshe mashed that up with another blockbuster entertainment genre that is also based on a cartoonishly fake performance of reality professional wrestling
576,it’s hard to overstate trump’s fascination with wrestling
577,he has performed as himself the ultrarich boss in world wrestling entertainment wwe appearances at least eight times enough to earn him a place in the wwe hall of fame
578,in a “battle of the billionaires” he pretended to pound wrestling kingpin vince mcmahon and then celebrated victory by publicly shaving mcmahon’s head in front of the cheering throngs
579,he also dropped thousands of dollars in cash into the audience of screaming fans
580,now he has appointed the former ceo of wwe linda mcmahon wife of vince to his cabinet as head of the small business administration a detail that has largely been lost amidst the daily deluge
581,as with the apprentice  trump’s side career in pro wrestling exposed and endeared him to a massive audiencein stadiums on tv and online
582,pro wrestling might be largely invisible as a cultural force to most liberal voters but wwe generates close to a billion dollars in annual revenue
583,and trump did more than pick up votes from this experiencehe also picked up tips
584,as matt taibbi pointed out in rolling stone  trump’s entire campaign had a distinctly wwe quality
585,his carefully nurtured feuds with other candidates were pure pro wrestling especially the way he handed out insulting nicknames  “little marco” “lyin’ ted”
586,and most wrestlinglike of all was the way trump played ringmaster at his rallies complete with overthetop insultchants  “lock her up” “killary” and directing the crowd’s rage at the arena’s designated villains journalists and demonstrators
587,outsiders would emerge from these events shaken not sure what had just happened
588,what happened is that they had just been to a bizarre cross between a prowrestling match and a white supremacist rally
589,what reality television and professional wrestling have in common is that they are forms of mass entertainment that are relatively new in american culture and they both establish a curious relationship with realityone that is both fake and still somehow genuine at the same time
590,with wwe every fight is fixed everybody knows that it’s rehearsed
591,but that doesn’t lessen the enjoyment in any way
592,the fact that everyone is in on the joke that the cheers and boos are part of the show increases the fun
593,the artifice is not a drawbackit’s the point
594,wrestling and reality tv both thrive on the spectacle of extreme emotion conflict and suffering
595,they both involve people screaming at each other and pulling each other’s hair out and in the case of wrestling beating the crap out of each other
596,but at the same time as you’re watching it you know it’s not real so you don’t have to care you get to be part of the drama without having to feel any empathy
597,nobody cries when wrestlers get slammed and humiliated any more than we were meant to cry for the apprentice contestants when trump fired or humiliated them
598,it’s a safe place to laugh at suffering
599,and it was all part of preparing the ground for that igor of all things fake donald trump
600,fake body parts fake wrestling fakereality tv fake news and his whole fake business model
601,and now trump has grafted this same warped relationship to reality onto his administration
602,he announces that obama wiretapped him in the same way that a wrestler declares he’s going to annihilate and humiliate his opponent
603,whether or not it’s true is beside the point
604,it’s part of rousing the crowd part of the theater
605,the apprentice may be off the air and trump may have retired his wwe career but the show is still on
606,indeed it never stops
607,newt gingrich who has been a pretty faithful cheerleader of donald trump was asked shortly before inauguration what he thought of the presidentelect’s decision to keep his position as executive producer of celebrity apprentice 
608,his answer was quite revealing
609,he said trump was making a mistake because he “is going to be the executive producer of a thing called the american government
610,he’s going to have a huge tv show called ‘leading the world’ ” and that’s exactly what’s happening
611,the trump show is now broadcasting live from the oval office
612,and from maralago which is even more like a tv show because its wellheeled members provide a builtin live studio audience
613,and it’s clear that this is precisely how trump sees his presidency too as the executive producer of a country always with an eye on the ratings
614,responding to the suggestion that he might fire his gaffemachine of a press secretary he reportedly said “i’m not firing sean spicer
615,that guy gets great ratings
616,everyone tunes in” it’s with the same brash showmanship that trump is now navigating or failing to navigatethe promises he made to bring back the bygone days of booming factories and bluecollar jobs that paid middleclass wages promises that he would impose a “buy american hire american” policy never mind that his own empire is built on outsourcing and exploited labor
617,this posture is as authentic as the violence he enacted when he appeared to take on a wwe wrestler in the ring or when he was choosing from among contestants on celebrity apprentice 
618,trump knows as well as anyone that the idea of american corporations returning to 1970sstyle manufacturing is a cruel joke
619,he knows this because as his own business practices attest a great many us companies are no longer manufacturers at all but hollow shells buying their own products from a web of cheap contractors
620,he may be able to bring back a few factories or claim that he did but the numbers will be minuscule compared with the need
621,there is a real way to create a great many wellpaying jobsbut it looks nothing like the trump approach
622,it requires looking to the future not the past as we’ll see in the final chapter
623,trump’s game plan which is already under way is to approach the unemployment and underemployment crisis in the same way he approaches everythingas a spectacle
624,he will claim credit for a relatively small number of jobsmost of which would have been created anywayand then market the hell out of those supposed success stories
625,it won’t matter one bit whether the job numbers support his claims
626,he’ll edit reality to fit his narrative just as he learned to do on the apprentice  and just as he did on his very first day as president insisting against all objective evidence that his inauguration crowds had been historic
627,this is what trump does and has always done
628,in 1992 when his empire was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy thanks to a series of bad investment decisions he didn’t deal with the situation by getting his finances in order
629,instead he threw an elaborate “comeback party” for his investors and financiers at the trump taj mahal in atlantic city which culminated in trumpwearing satin boxing shorts and red boxing glovespunching through a paper wall to the theme song from rocky 
630,this is a man who thinks he can solve anything with the right stagemanaged performance and very often in the past he’s been proven right
631,so just as he spun and performed his way out of bankruptcy he is convinced he can do the same with the country’s economy
632,fake news alternative facts and the big lie if we know anything for certain it’s that hard facts don’t matter in donald trump’s world
633,with trump it’s not so much the big lie as the constant lies
634,yes he tells big ones like the time he implied ted cruz’s dad had a role in assassinating jfk and his years of lies about obama’s place of birth
635,but it’s the continuous stream of lies notoriously offered to us as “alternative facts”that is most dizzying
636,according to a politico investigation this is quite deliberate “white house staffers do much of their lying for sport rather than to further any larger agenda” even competing over who can “smuggle the biggest whoppers into print” though these claims are based on anonymous sources and so may themselves be lies the story fits with what we know about trump what good is reaching the pinnacle of power if you can’t bend reality to your will
637,in trump’s world and according to the internal logic of his brand lying with impunity is all part of being the big boss
638,being tethered to fixed boring facts is for losers
639,and so far it seems to be working at least with his base
640,some liberals have seized upon this apparent tolerance for “alternative facts” to dismiss his workingclass voters as “suckers” but it’s worth remembering that a large portion of barack obama’s base was quite happy to embrace the carefully crafted symbols his administration createdthe white house lit up like a rainbow to celebrate gay marriage the shift to a civil erudite tone the spectacle of an incredibly appealing first family free of major scandals for eight years
641,and these were all good things
642,but too often these same supporters looked the other way when it came to the drone warfare that killed countless civilians or the deportations of roughly 25 million immigrants without documents during obama’s term or his broken promises to close guantanamo or shut down george w bush’s mass surveillance architecture
643,obama positioned himself as a climate hero but at one point bragged that his administration had “added enough new oil and gas pipelines to encircle the earth and then some” in canada many liberals are displaying the same kind of selective blindness
644,dazzled by the progressive messaging of our handsome prime minister they are letting him hang on to many of his predecessor’s disastrous policies from the indefinite detention of many immigrants to ramming through tar sands pipelines more on that later
645,politically justin trudeau is very different from donald trump but for his staunchest supporterswho often behave a lot like fanshis celebrity has a similarly distorting effect
646,this new “trudeaumania” reminds us that conservatives aren’t the only ones capable of confusing engaged citizenship with brand loyalty
647,of course trump’s successful attempt to sell his white working class voters on the dream of a manufacturing comeback will eventually come crashing down to earth
648,but what is most worrying is what trump will do then once it’s no longer possible to hide the fact that coal jobs aren’t coming back and neither are the factory jobs that paid workers enough to provide their families with a middleclass life
649,in all likelihood trump will then fall back on the only other tools he has he’ll double down on pitting white workers against immigrant workers do more to rile up fears about black crime more to whip up an absurd frenzy about transgendered people and bathrooms and launch fiercer attacks on reproductive rights and on the press
650,and then of course there’s always war
651,the apocalypse show acknowledging that trump’s presidency is being produced like a reality show in no way diminishes the danger it representsquite the opposite
652,people have already died in this showin yemen in afghanistan in syria in the united statesand many more will meet the same fate before it goes off the air
653,in march alone a ukbased monitoring group recorded allegations of more than 1500 civilian deaths from usled coalition airstrikes in iraq and syria higher than ever recorded under obama
654,but that doesn’t mean it’s not a show
655,bloodsport reality tv is after all a sciencefiction cliché
656,think of the hunger games  with its reality tv spectacle in which all the players die but one
657,or the running man  another film about a televised event where the stakes are life or death
658,wilbur ross trump’s commerce secretary reportedly described the bombing of syria as maralago’s “after dinner entertainment” the most chilling part is that as i write trump has only just started playing his version of the maralago hunger games with the full arsenal of us military power as his propsand he is getting plenty of encouragement to keep upping the ante
659,when trump launched tomahawk missiles on syria msnbc host brian williams declared the images “beautiful” just one week later trump went for more spectacle dropping the largest nonnuclear weapon in the us arsenal on a cave complex in afghanistan an act of violence so indiscriminate and disproportionate that analysts struggled to find any rationale that could resemble a coherent military strategy
660,because there was no strategythe megatonnage is the message
661,mass communication through bombs
662,given that trump ordered the use of a weapon that had never been deployed in combat before and given that he did this just twelve weeks into his presidency and with no obvious provocation there is little reason to hope he will be able to resist putting on the show of showsthe televised apocalyptic violence of a fullblown war complete with its guaranteed blockbuster ratings
663,well before trump we had wars fought as televised entertainment
664,the 1990 gulf war was dubbed the first videogame war complete with its own logo and theme music on cnn
665,but that was nothing compared with the show put on during the 2003 iraq invasion based on a military strategy called “shock and awe” the attacks were designed as a spectacle for cable news consumers but also for iraqis to maximize their sense of helplessness to “teach them a lesson” now that fearsome technology is in the hands of the first reality tv president
666,we need to get ready a subject i’ll return to in chapter 9 
667,hollow man if there is one real aspect to the festival of fakery that is the trump presidency it’s the hunger at the heart of it
668,the sheer insatiability
669,trump likes to talk about how he doesn’t need more moneyhe has more than enough
670,yet he just can’t help selling his products at every opportunity can’t stop working every angle
671,it’s as if he suffers from some obscure modern illnesslet’s call it a brand personality disorder that causes him to slip into brand promotion almost involuntarily
672,he’ll be giving a political speech and then suddenly he’s talking about how beautiful and expensive the marble is at a trump hotel or gratuitously telling his interviewer when discussing how he ordered a lethal bombing of syria that the chocolate cake at maralago is “the most beautifulyou’ve ever seen” that unquenchable hunger that hollowness at the center does speak to something realto a profound emptiness at the heart of the very culture that spawned donald trump
673,and that hollowness is intimately connected to the rise of lifestyle brands the shift that gave trump an everexpanding platform
674,the rise of the hollow brands selling everything owning next to nothinghappened over decades when the key institutions that used to provide individuals with a sense of community and shared identity were in sharp decline tightly knit neighborhoods where people looked out for one another large workplaces that held out the promise of a job for life space and time for ordinary people to make their own art not just consume it organized religion political movements and trade unions that were grounded in facetoface relationships publicinterest media that strove to knit nations together in a common conversation
675,all these institutions and traditions were and are imperfect often deeply so
676,they left many people out and very often enforced an unhealthy conformity
677,but they did offer something we humans need for our wellbeing and for which we never cease to long community connection a sense of mission larger than our immediate atomized desires
678,these two trendsthe decline of communal institutions and the expansion of corporate brands in our culturehave had an inverse seesawlike relationship to one another over the decades as the influence of those institutions that provided us with that essential sense of belonging went down the power of commercial brands went up
679,i’ve always taken solace from this dynamic
680,it means that while our branded world can exploit the unmet need to be part of something larger than ourselves it can’t fill it in any sustained way you make a purchase to be part of a tribe a big idea a revolution and it feels good for a moment but the satisfaction wears off almost before you’ve thrown out the packaging for that new pair of sneakers that latest model iphone or whatever the surrogate is
681,then you have to find a way to fill the void again
682,it’s the perfect formula for endless consumption and perpetual selfcommodification through social media and it’s a disaster for the planet which cannot sustain these levels of consumption
683,but it’s always worth remembering at the heart of this cycle is that very powerful forcethe human longing for community and connection which simply refuses to die
684,and that means there is still hope if we rebuild our communities and begin to derive more meaning and a sense of the good life from them many of us are going to be less susceptible to the siren song of mindless consumerism and while we’re at it we might even spend less time producing and editing our personal brands on social media
685,as we’ll see in part iv  many movements and theorists are working toward just this kind of shift in culture and values
686,before we get to that though there are a few more important trails we need to follow to help us understand how we ended up here
687,part ii where we are now climate of inequality i imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense once hate is gone that they will be forced to deal with pain 
688,james baldwin notes of a native son  1955 chapter four the climate clock strikes midnight let’s rewind a bit to the week trump won
689,at that moment i was reeling from witnessing not one catastrophe but two
690,and i don’t think we can understand the true danger of the trump disaster unless we grapple with both of them
691,as i mentioned i was in australia for work but i was also very conscious that because of the carbon involved in that kind of travel i might not be able to return for a long time
692,so i decided to visit for the first time in my life the great barrier reef off the coast of queensland a world heritage site and the earth’s largest natural structure made up of living creatures
693,it was simultaneously the most beautiful and the most frightening thing i had ever seen
694,i spent a lot of time underwater as a kid
695,my father taught me to snorkel when i was six or seven and those are some of my happiest memories
696,there was always something amazing to me about the intimacy of the interactions with ocean life
697,when you first swim up to a reef the fish mostly scatter
698,but if you hang out for a few minutes they stop seeing you as an intruder and you become part of the seascape to themthey’ll swim right up to your mask or nibble on your arm
699,as an anxious kid i always found these experiences wonderfully dreamlike and peaceful
700,as the australian trip approached i realized that my feelings about seeing the reef were tied up in my being the mother of a fouryearold boy toma
701,as parents we can sometimes make the mistake of exposing kids too early to all the threats and dangers facing the natural world
702,the first book about nature that a lot of children read is dr seuss’s the lorax  which is all about pollution and beautiful places being turned into garbage and all the animals dying and disappearing and choking
703,it’s really scary
704,i read it to toma when he was two and watched the terror cross his face
705,and i thought “no this is completely wrong” now we read stories about fasttalking squirrels and books that celebrate nature’s beauty and wonder
706,even if i know these books are about species that are on the brink of extinction toma doesn’t need to worry about that yet
707,i figure that my job is to try to create as many positive experiences as possible that will attach him to the natural world
708,you need to love something first before you can protect and defend it
709,i also wanted to go to the reef in my role as a journalist
710,over the previous two years something unprecedented in recorded history had happened
711,because of recordbreaking temperatures more than 90 percent of the great barrier reef had been impacted by what’s known as a “mass bleaching event” it’s hard to stress just how cataclysmic the bleaching has been
712,when coral is bleached those beautiful intensely colored creaturesan ecosystem as rich and teeming as the amazon rain forestturn ghostly and bonewhite
713,bleached coral can recover if temperatures quickly go back down to normal levels
714,this time they hadn’t gone back downso almost a quarter of the reef has died
715,it’s worth underlining how little warming it took to bring about such a radical change
716,ocean temperatures went up just one degree celsius higher than the levels to which these incredible species are adapted and that was enough for a massive dieoff
717,unlike many other climate changerelated events this wasn’t some dramatic storm or wildfire just silent watery death
718,when we got to the reef there was still an air of unreality about the whole thing the port douglas boats packed with tourists were still going out the surface of the water was blue and beautiful there were stretches of spectacular turquoise
719,but the ocean has a way of hiding humanity’s worst secrets a lesson i first learned covering bp’s deepwater horizon disaster and seeing how quickly the spill disappeared from the headlines once the oil began to sink though the damage below continued unabated
720,we went out on the reef with a team of extraordinarily dedicated marine biologists all of whom were emotionally shattered by what they had been documenting and a film crew from the guardian 
721,we started filming the parts of the reef that are still alive and we managed to get toma to put on a snorkel
722,to be honest i wasn’t sure he was going to be able to focus on the coral at all he had just learned to swim and was wearing floaties
723,but the scientists were incredibly patient with him and there were about five solid minutes when he really was able to pull it off and have a flash of true wonderhe “saw nemo” he saw a sea cucumber
724,i think he even saw a sea turtle
725,these parts of the reef the ones that are neither bleached nor dead are only a fraction of the whole but they are still gloriousa riot of life of electriccolored coral and fish sea turtles and sharks swimming by
726,we didn’t take toma on the boat when we filmed the dead and bleached parts of the reef
727,and it was a graveyard
728,it was as if a cosmic switch had been flipped and suddenly one of the most beautiful places on earth had been turned into one of the ugliest
729,the coral bones were covered in a goo of decaying lifea brown goo
730,you just wanted to get away from there
731,our wetsuits stank of death
732,we chose to film the reef in this state because for many people there is a sense that climate change is a distant crisis that there’s still a bit of time to procrastinate before we get serious
733,we wanted to show that radical changes to our planet including parts we count on to be brimming with life are not far off in the futurethey are happening right now
734,and the impacts are enormous including the fact that roughly one billion people around the world rely on the fish sustained by coral reefs for food and income
735,and i wanted to try to show the disaster through toma’s eyes too
736,because one of the most unjust aspects of climate disruption and there are many is that our actions as adults today will have their most severe impact on the lives of generations yet to come as well as kids alive today who are too young to impact policykids like toma and his friends and their generation the world over
737,these children have done nothing to create the crisis but they are the ones who will deal with the most extreme weatherthe storms and droughts and fires and rising seasand all the social and economic stresses that will flow as a result
738,they are the ones growing up amidst a mass extinction robbed of so much beauty and so much of the companionship that comes from being surrounded by other life forms
739,it is a form of theft of violencewhat the author and theorist rob nixon calls “slow violence” a clean vibrant planet is the birthright of all living beings
740,that’s why the great barrier reef is classified as a world heritage site
741,it belongs to the world and it is dying on our watch
742,i realized that the story i wanted to tell is about intergenerational theft and intergenerational justice
743,that’s why i decided to put toma on camera for the first time i was reluctant but i just couldn’t tell that story without him
744,by the end of the day we were all completely wiped out
745,we had seen so much death so much loss but my son had also had this special experience
746,that night tucking him into bed in our port douglas motel room i said “toma today is the day when you discovered there is a secret world under the sea” and he just looked up at me with an expression of pure bliss and said “i saw it” i burst into tears some mixture of joy and heartbreak at the knowledge that just as he is becoming aware of this beauty in the world all this magic it is being drained away
747,i have to admit i was angry too
748,that whole day i had not been able to stop thinking about exxonmobilabout how this company it has now been documented knew about climate change as far back as the seventies
749,according to a groundbreaking investigation by insideclimate news nominated for a pulitzer prize exxon did its own cuttingedge empirical research taking co 2 samples off its oil tankers and building stateofthe art climate models that predicted the coming changes such as sealevel rise
750,it also received warnings from its own senior scientists including james black who was categorical in his reports to his employer about the “general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels” he also wrote that “man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical” that was in 1978 by the time rex tillerson took over the job of general manager of the central production division of exxon usa these facts had long been known in the company including the uncomfortable one about how little time remained
751,despite this exxonmobil has since then lavished more than 30 million on think tanks that systematically spread doubt through the press about the reality of climate science
752,mobil before its merger with exxon even took out its own fullpage ads in the new york times casting doubt on the science
753,exxonmobil is currently under investigation by the attorneys general of new york california and massachusetts for these alleged deceptions
754,because of this campaign of misinformation promoted by the entire fossil fuel sector humanity lost key decades when we could have been taking the actions necessary to move to a clean economythe same decades in which exxonmobil and others opened up vast frontiers for oil and gas
755,if we had not lost that time the great barrier reef might still be healthy today
756,but my time at the reef didn’t leave me feeling entirely helpless
757,because there are dogged communities and growing movements around the world determined to get their governments to wake up and stop drilling new oil and gas fields and digging new coal mines
758,we rushed like mad to turn the film around in four days so it could be out on the eve of the us elections thinking it might play some tiny part in motivating people to vote and then in fueling the pressure to get hillary clinton to do more on climate
759,and we made itwe posted the video on november 7 the next day trump won
760,and then exxonmobil’s ceo was named secretary of state
761,truth time the stakes in the 2016 election were enormously high for a great many reasons from the millions who stood to lose their health insurance to those targeted by racist attacks as trump fanned the flames of rising white nationalism from the families that stood to be torn apart by cruel immigration policies to the prospect of women losing the right to decide whether or not to become mothers to the reality of sexual assault being normalized and trivialized at the highest reaches of power
762,with so many lives on the line there is nothing to be gained by ranking issues by urgency and playing “my crisis is bigger than your crisis” if it’s happening to you if it’s your family being torn apart or you who is being singled out for police harassment or your grandmother who cannot afford a lifesaving treatment or your drinking water that’s laced with leadit’s all a fivealarm fire
763,climate change isn’t more important than any of these other issues but it does have a different relationship to time
764,when the politics of climate change go wrongand they are very very wrong right now we don’t get to try again in four years
765,because in four years the earth will have been radically changed by all the gases emitted in the interim and our chances of averting an irreversible catastrophe will have shrunk
766,this may sound alarmist but i have interviewed the leading scientists in the world on this question and their research shows that it’s simply a neutral description of reality
767,the window during which there is time to lower emissions sufficiently to avoid truly catastrophic warming is closing rapidly
768,lots of social movements have adopted samuel beckett’s famous line “try again
769,fail again
770,fail better” as a lighthearted motto
771,i’ve always liked the attitude we can’t be perfect we won’t always win but we should strive to improve
772,the trouble is beckett’s dictum doesn’t work for climatenot at this stage in the game
773,if we keep failing to lower emissions if we keep failing to kick start the transition in earnest away from fossil fuels and to an economy based on renewables if we keep dodging the question of wasteful consumption and the quest for more and more and bigger and bigger there won’t be more opportunities to fail better
774,nearly everything is moving faster than the climate change modeling projected including arctic seaice loss icesheet collapse ocean warming sealevel rise and coral bleaching
775,the next time voters in countries around the world go to the polls more sea ice will have melted more coastal land will have been lost more species will have disappeared for good
776,the chance for us to keep temperatures below what it would take for island nations such as say tuvalu or the maldives to be saved from drowning becomes that much slimmer
777,these are irreversible changeswe don’t get a doover on a drowned country
778,the latest peerreviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities in my son’s lifetimeincluding metropolises like new york city and mumbaithen we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed
779,a paper from oxford university that came out during the campaign published in the applied energy journal concluded that for humanity to have a fiftyfifty chance of meeting the temperature targets set in the climate accord negotiated in paris at the end of 2015 every new power plant would have to be zero carbon starting in 2018 that’s the second year of the trump presidency
780,for most of usincluding methis is very hard information to wrap our heads around because we are used to narratives that reassure us about the inevitability of eventual progress
781,martin luther king jr said “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice” it’s a powerful idea that sadly doesn’t work for the climate crisis
782,the wealthy governments of the world have procrastinated for so long and made the problem so much worse in the meantime that the arc has to bend very very fast nowor the shot at justice is gone for good
783,we are almost at midnight on the climate clock
784,not just another election cycleepic bad timing during the democratic primaries i was really struck by the moment when a young woman confronted hillary clinton on the campaign trail and asked her ifgiven the scale of the global warming crisisshe would pledge not to take any more money from the fossil fuel interests that are supercharging it
785,up to that point clinton’s campaign had received large sums of money from employees and registered lobbyists of fossil fuel companiesabout 17 million according to greenpeace’s research
786,clinton looked disgusted and snapped at the young woman saying she was “so sick” of this issue coming up
787,a few days later in an interview clinton said young people should “do their own research” the woman who had asked the question eva resnickday worked as a campaigner for greenpeace
788,she had done her research she insisted “and that is why we are so terrified for the future
789,what happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species” for me her words cut to the heart of why this was not just another election cycle
790,why it was not only legitimate but necessary to question hillary’s web of corporate entanglements
791,resnickday’s comments also highlight one of the big reasons why trump’s presidency is harrowing the most powerful man in the world is a person who says global warming is a hoax invented by the chinese and who is feverishly trashing the already inadequate restraints on fossil fuels that his country had put in place encouraging other governments to do the same
792,and it’s all happening at the worst possible time in human history
793,we have so far warmed the planet by just one degree celsius and from that we are already seeing dramatic results the mass coral die off balmy arctic weather leading to severe ice loss the breaking apart of antarctic ice sheets
794,if we continue on our current pollution trajectory we are set to warm the planet by four to six degrees celsius
795,the climate scientist and emissions expert kevin anderson says that four degrees of warming is “incompatible with any reasonable characterization of an organized equitable and civilized global community” that is why governments came together in paris and drew up an agreement to make their best efforts to get off this dangerous course and try to limit warming to “well below” 2 degrees pursuing efforts to keep it below 15 degrees
796,the high end of that temperature target represents double the warming we have already experienced so it’s by no means safe
797,which is why we have to try very hard to hit the lower end of that target
798,and that’s tough
799,according to a september 2016 study by the washingtonbased think tank oil change international if governments want a solid chance of keeping temperature increases below two degrees celsius then all new and undeveloped fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground
800,the problem is even before trump no major economy was doing what was required
801,they were all still trying to have it all waysintroducing some solid green policies but then approving expanded fossil fuel extraction and new pipelines
802,it’s like eating lots of salad and a whole lot of junk food at the same time and expecting to lose weight
803,in the united states obama introduced the clean power plan which was set to accelerate the retirement of the country’s aging coal plants and to require new ones to capture some of their carbon emissions but he was simultaneously presiding over a boom in natural gas fracking and fracked oil in the bakken
804,in canada the government has introduced national carbon pricing and a coal phaseout but it is also allowing the tar sands to expand and approved a massive new liquid gas export terminalpretty much guaranteeing that it won’t hit its paris goals
805,even so the fact that so many governments signed the paris accord to great fanfare and at least paid lip service to the need to achieve its ambitious temperature targets gave the climate movement a lot of leverage to push for policies that were in step with the stated goal
806,we were trying to hold them to their word in paris and we were making some progress
807,but now trump is saying leave all that money in the ground
808,are you nuts
809,a very oily administration on the campaign trail trump’s standard stump speech reliably hit all the crowdpleasers build the wall bring back the jobs law and order crooked hillary
810,climate change denial usually didn’t make the list though trump would spout off if asked
811,but if the issue seemed peripheral during the campaign that changed as soon as trump began making appointments
812,and since his inauguration taking aim at any and all climate protections has been a defining feature of the trump administration
813,as if in a race against time he and his team have set out to systematically tick off every single item on the fossil fuel industry’s wish list
814,his top appointments his plans to make severe budget cuts and gut environmental regulations his conspiratorial denials of climate change and even his entanglements with russia they all point in the same direction a deep and abiding determination to kick off a noholdsbarred fossil fuel frenzy
815,there are many plots and intrigues swirling around washington most notoriously claims about the trump team conspiring with russia to influence the 2016 election outcomeand these are being investigated as they should be
816,but make no mistake trump’s collusion with the fossil fuel sector is the conspiracy hiding in plain sight
817,within days of taking office he pushed through the dakota access pipeline cutting off an environmental review and against the powerful opposition of the standing rock sioux
818,he’s cleared the way to approve the keystone xl pipeline from alberta which obama rejected in part because of the climate impacts
819,he has issued an executive order to roll back obama’s moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands and has already announced plans to expand oil and gas drilling on the gulf coast
820,he’s also killing obama’s clean power plan
821,and as the administration rubberstamps new fossil fuel projects they’re getting rid of all kinds of environmental regulations that made digging up and processing this carbon less profitable for companies like exxonmobil
822,as a result these projects already disastrous from a climate perspective are more likely to lead to industrial accidents like the deepwater horizon disasterbecause that’s what happens when regulators are missing in action
823,as i write it’s not yet clear whether the us will officially withdraw from the paris accord there is some disagreement about this within the administration
824,but whether the country stays or leaves it’s undeniable that the trump administration is shredding the commitments made under the accord
825,in addition to rex tillerson trump has stacked his administration with fossil fuel executives and political figures with extensive ties to the industryseveral of whom are opposed or at best indifferent to the mandates of the agencies they’re now in charge of running
826,scott pruitt is trump’s head of the environmental protection agencybut as attorney general of oklahoma he sued the epa multiple times and perhaps not coincidentally has received tens of thousands of dollars from fossil fuel companies
827,trump’s pick for energy secretary rick perry had myriad ties to the oil industry including serving on the boards of two of the companies behind the dakota access pipeline
828,back in 2011 while running for the gop nomination perry campaigned on eliminating the energy department entirely
829,don’t ask don’t tell together this group of men is doing favors for oil gas and coal companies on multiple fronts
830,for instance trump has killed a new program that required oil and gas companies to report how much methanea very powerful greenhouse gastheir operations were releasing including from leaks
831,industry hated the program which was only finalized in the last weeks of obama’s administration in part because it was poised to blow the lid off the claim that natural gas is in any way a climate change solution
832,trump is handing the industry a big gift by effectively saying don’t tell us we don’t want to know
833,from here on in the rest of the world will have to guess the extent to which the us is a climate renegade because a key piece of the data won’t exist
834,by far the biggest threat this industry faces is the demand for real action on climate change being voiced by people around the world and the mounting consensus that taking the crisis seriously means a halt on new fossil fuel projects
835,that prospect strikes terror in the hearts of fossil fuel executives and in the governments of petrostates like russia because it means that trillions of dollars’ worth of proven reservescurrently propping up share pricescould become worthless overnight
836,this is sometimes referred to as “the carbon bubble” and by 2016 it was already beginning to deflate
837,think of trump as the guy running to the rescue with a bicycle pump signaling to the industry that he’s going to fill their bubble with a few more years’ worth of toxic air
838,how
839,easy
840,by making climate change disappear
841,we can see it all playing out with a kind of absurd clarity
842,on day one the white house website was cleansed of many of the references to climate change
843,there are plans to cut the nasa program that uses satellites to accumulate basic data on how the earth is changing including disappearing glaciers and rising seas
844,the white house’s budget director mick mulvaney was pretty blunt about all this “regarding the question as to climate change i think the president was fairly straightforwardwe’re not spending money on that anymore
845,we consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that” they are so determined to erase the reality of climate change that they are even aiming to wipe out programs that help communities cope with its impacts
846,trump proposed cutting a national oceanic and atmospheric association program that helps communities protect their coasts
847,he also wanted to slash the federal emergency management agency fema  the agency charged with responding to largescale natural disasters and cut entirely its key program designed to help communities prepare for future crises
848,his plan to reduce the environmental protection agency’s epa budget by over 30 percent would lay off thousands of people and eliminate the entire environmental justice program
849,the latter helps lowincome communitiesoverwhelmingly africanamerican latino and indigenousdeal with some of the impacts of having the most toxic industries in their backyards
850,and it’s worth noting that many of the measuresincluding cuts to programs dealing with lead poisoning from pipeswould disproportionately hurt children in marginalized communities
851,a congressional budget deal has delayed the worst of the epa cuts until 2018 so trump’s rescue plan for the fossil fuel sector is multipronged bury the evidence that climate change is happening by stopping research and gagging agencies cut the programs that are tasked with coping with the realworld impacts of climate disruption and remove all barriers to an acceleration of the very activities that are fueling the crisisdrilling for more oil and gas mining and burning more coal
852,some of this backsliding can be balanced out by bold action in large states such as california and new york which are pledging to rapidly roll out renewables regardless of trump’s profossil fuel policies
853,but there is one other crucial factor that may determine whether the exxonmobil subsidiary known as the trump administration is able to unleash an irreversible catastrophe
854,price is everything there is one thing above all that is currently restraining fossil fuel companies from launching large new extraction projects and it’s not a piece of legislation that obama introduced and trump can reverse
855,what’s holding them back is the price of oil and gas
856,as i write this in 2017 the price is much lower than when obama took office because there’s an oversupplymore oil and gas is available than consumers want
857,the reason price is such an issue for new projects is that the cheap and easytoaccess fossil fuels have been steadily running out particularly in the us
858,so what’s left
859,stuff that’s hard and expensive to get to
860,it costs a lot of money to drill in the arctic or in very deep water or to dig up and refine the semisolid oil found in canada’s alberta tar sands
861,when the price of oil was soaring as it was as recently as 2014 fossil fuel companies were making multibillion dollar investments in order to go after those expensive fuel sources
862,with oil at 100 a barrel they could still turn a hefty profit even with the high costs for extraction
863,and the development in this sector did spur economic growth and it did create a lot of jobs
864,but the environmental costs were enormous the deepwater horizon disaster in the gulf of mexico was intimately connected to the fact that these companies are drilling deeper than they ever have before
865,the reason the tar sands in alberta are so controversial is that indigenous lands and waterways have been badly contaminated by the invasive and carbonintensive process of mining for that heavy crude
866,rex tillerson’s exxonmobil went wild buying up highcost heavyoil reserves it reached the point where fully onethird of the company’s reserves were located in the alberta tar sands
867,when the price of oil collapsed it came as a major shock
868,oil prices began to crash in 2014 with brent crudethe global benchmark for oilplummeting from 100 a barrel to 50 in just six months and the price has hovered at around 55 a barrel ever since
869,as a result we’ve seen a lot of companies pulling back from extreme energy projects
870,fracking for oil and gas in the united states has cooled off with devastating human costs an estimated 170000 oil and gas workers have lost their jobs after the 2014 price collapse
871,investment in the alberta tar sands dropped by an estimated 37 percent in the year following and continues to fall
872,shell pulled back from the arctic and has sold most of its tar sands reserves
873,the french oil company total has retreated from the tar sands as well
874,even exxonmobil has been forced to write off nearly 35 million barrels of tar sands oil because the market considered these reserves to be no longer worth extracting at current oil prices
875,deepwater drilling is also in a lull
876,for the big oil companiesparticularly those that gambled on the price of oil staying highall of this has been a disaster
877,and no oil major has suffered more than exxonmobil
878,when prices were high with tillerson at the helm the company broke the record for the highest corporate profits ever reported in the united states earning 45 billion in 2012 compare that to 2016 when exxon’s profits fell well shy of 8 billion
879,that’s a more than 80 percent drop in profits in a span of just four years
880,what does all this mean
881,it means that oil majors like exxonmobil and the banks that underwrote their bad bets desperately want the price of oil to go back upto get their superprofits back and to get the fossil fuel frenzy back on
882,so a very big question that needs answering is this what is the trump administrationaka team exxonmobil going to do to achieve that
883,we are already seeing some policies that appear designed to drive up oil prices
884,for instance trump moved to eliminate the obamaera requirement that vehicles become more fuelefficientwhich means more trips to the gas station for consumers
885,trump’s budget plan meanwhile aimed to completely eliminate funding for new public transit projects and kill funding for longdistance train services
886,so far though the market isn’t responding at least not by much
887,the price of oil got a little bump after trump was elected but has held pretty steady since
888,from a climate perspective this is good news cheap gas may encourage shortterm consumption but it discourages a lot of the longterm investments that lock us into a disastrous future
889,the concernand it is a real oneis that trump and co may well have more tricks up their sleeves to try to push up oil prices and realize their goal of setting off a fossil fuel frenzy
890,the reason we need to have our eyes firmly fixed on this dynamic is that nothing drives up the price of oil quite like war and other major shocks to the world marketa scenario we’ll dig into in chapter 9 
891,what conservatives understand about global warming and liberals don’t for many years i wondered why some people were so determined to deny global warming
892,it’s strange at first glance
893,why would you work so hard to deny the scientific facts that have been affirmed by 97 percent of climate scientistsfacts whose effects we see all around us with more confirmation in the news we consume every day
894,that question led me on a journey that informed my book this changes everything and i think some of what i discovered when writing that book can help us make sense of the centrality of climate vandalism to the trump administration
895,what i found is that when hardcore conservatives deny climate change they are not just protecting the trillions in wealth that are threatened by climate action
896,they are also defending something even more precious to them an entire ideological projectneoliberalism which holds that the market is always right regulation is always wrong private is good and public is bad and taxes that support public services are the worst of all
897,there is a lot of confusion around the word neoliberalism  and about who is a neoliberal
898,and understandably so
899,so let’s break it down
900,neoliberalism is an extreme form of capitalism that started to become dominant in the 1980s under ronald reagan and margaret thatcher but since the 1990s has been the reigning ideology of the world’s elites regardless of partisan affiliation
901,still its strictest and most dogmatic adherents remain where the movement started on the us right
902,neoliberalism is shorthand for an economic project that vilifies the public sphere and anything that’s not either the workings of the market or the decisions of individual consumers
903,it is probably best summarized by another of reagan’s famous phrases “the nine most terrifying words in the english language are i’m from the government and i’m here to help” under the neoliberal worldview governments exist in order to create the optimal conditions for private interests to maximize their profits and wealth based on the theory that the profits and economic growth that follow will benefit everyone in the trickle down from the topeventually
904,if it doesn’t work and stubborn inequalities remain or worsen as they invariably do then according to this worldview that must be the personal failing of the individuals and communities that are suffering
905,they must have “a culture of crime” say or lack a “work ethic” or perhaps it’s absentee fathers or some other racially tinged excuse for why government policy and public funds should never be used to reduce inequalities improve lives or address structural crises
906,the primary tools of this project are all too familiar privatization of the public sphere deregulation of the corporate sphere and low taxes paid for by cuts to public services and all of this locked in under corporatefriendly trade deals
907,it’s the same recipe everywhere regardless of context history or the hopes and dreams of the people who live there
908,larry summers when he was chief economist of the world bank in 1991 summed up the ethos “spread the truththe laws of economics are like the laws of engineering
909,one set of laws works everywhere” which is why i sometimes call neoliberalism “mcgovernment” the 1989 collapse of the berlin wall was interpreted as the signal to take the campaign global
910,with socialism in decline there was seemingly no longer any need to soften capitalism’s edges anywhere
911,as thatcher famously declared “there is no alternative” another way of thinking about this is that neoliberalism is simply capitalism without competition or capitalism lying on the couch in its undershirt saying “what are you going to do leave me” neoliberalism is a very profitable set of ideas which is why i am always a little hesitant to describe it as an ideology
912,what it really is at its core is a rationale for greed
913,that’s what the american billionaire warren buffett meant when he made headlines a few years ago by telling cnn that “there’s been class warfare going on for the last twenty years and my class has wonthe rich class” he was referring to the tremendous tax cuts the wealthy have enjoyed in this period but you could extend that to the whole neoliberal policy package
914,so what does this have to do with the widespread refusal by the right to believe that climate change is happening a refusal deeply embedded in the trump administration
915,a lot
916,because climate change especially at this late date can only be dealt with through collective action that sharply curtails the behavior of corporations such as exxonmobil and goldman sachs
917,it demands investments in the public spherein new energy grids public transit and light rail and energy efficiencyon a scale not seen since the second world war
918,and that can only happen by raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations the very people trump is determined to shower with the most generous tax cuts loopholes and regulatory breaks
919,responding to climate change also means giving communities the freedom to prioritize local green industriesa process that often clashes directly with the corporate free trade deals that have been such an integral part of neoliberalism and which bar “buy local” rules as protectionist
920,trump campaigned against those parts of free trade deals but as we will see in chapter 6  he has no intention of rescinding those rules
921,in short climate change detonates the ideological scaffolding on which contemporary conservatism rests
922,to admit that the climate crisis is real is to admit the end of the neoliberal project
923,that’s why the right is in a rebellion against the physical world against science which is what prompted hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to participate in the march for science in april 2017 collectively defending a principle that really shouldn’t need defending that knowing as much as possible about our world is a good thing
924,but there is a reason why science has become such a battle zonebecause it is revealing again and again that neoliberal business as usual leads to a speciesthreatening catastrophe
925,what mainstream liberals have been saying for decades by contrast is that we simply need to tweak the existing system here and there and everything will be fine
926,you can have goldman sachs capitalism plus solar panels
927,but the challenge is much more fundamental than that
928,it requires throwing out the neoliberal rulebook and confronting the centrality of everexpanding consumption in how we measure economic progress
929,in one sense then the members of trump’s cabinetwith their desperate need to deny the reality of global warming or belittle its implicationsunderstand something that is fundamentally true to avert climate chaos we need to challenge the capitalist ideologies that have conquered the world since the 1980s
930,if you are the beneficiary of those ideologies you are obviously going to be very unhappy about that
931,that’s understandable
932,global warming really does have radical progressive implications
933,if it’s realand it manifestly isthen the oligarch class cannot continue to run riot without rules
934,stopping them is now a matter of humanity’s collective survival
935,if we fail the death i saw at the great barrier reef will spread to all corners of our collective home in ways we can scarcely imagine
936,chapter five the grabberinchief since trump took office there’s been a lot of talk about how we all need to stop “relitigating the 2016 election”that it’s time to look forward not backward
937,to be honest i’m tired of looking backward as well because the tensions during the election and in particular during the democratic primary were almost unbearable
938,for a long time i couldn’t look at social media because all i saw were people who used to like each other warring over “bernie bros” and “hillary bots” i lost friends over it as others did on all sidespeople who blame me and people like me for hillary’s defeat because we did not publicly endorse her or because we were so hard on her corporate entanglements during the primary
939,and i have trouble forgiving people like the liberal economist paul krugman who has written so much of such great importance about economic inequality and bank fraud over the years and yet used his influential platform in the new york times to repeatedly attack the only candidate bernie sanders who was serious about battling income inequality and taking on the banks
940,it’s perfectly understandable that people don’t want to rehash those ugly battles they were miserable
941,we all cope with fear and uncertainty differently
942,a great many conservatives are dealing with their fears about a changing and destabilizing world by attempting to force back the clock
943,but if the right specializes in turning backward the left specializes in turning inward and firing on each other in a circular hail of blame
944,still i’m suspicious of the speed with which we are being told to move on
945,because we do need to build as broad a coalition as possible against trump and forces like him wherever we livebut we also need to avoid repeating the same mistakes that have created the conditions for the rise of trumpism and its counterparts around the world
946,and unfortunately there’s some evidence that the only lesson a lot of establishment democrats are learning is don’t let russians hack your email
947,so i think we should take a deep breath and dare to look back if only brieflynot to reopen old wounds but just to see what there is to learn
948,because we can’t get off the road we are on if we aren’t honest about the factors that landed us here
949,foul mood rising if there is a single overarching lesson to be drawn from the foul mood rising around the world it may be this we should never ever underestimate the power of hate
950,never underestimate the appeal of wielding power over “the other” be they migrants muslims blacks mexicans women the other in any form
951,especially during times of economic hardship when a great many people have good reason to fear that the jobs that can support a decent life are disappearing for good
952,trump speaks directly to that economic panic and simultaneously to the resentment felt by a large segment of white america about the changing face of their country about positions of power and privilege increasingly being held by people who do not look like them
953,the intensity and irrationality of the rage trump and his strongest supporters reserved for barack obama the years of feverish desire to strip him of his americanness by “proving” he was kenyan thereby rendering him “other” cannot be explained by anything but race hatred
954,this is the “whitelash” that cnn commentator van jones named on election night and there is no doubt that for a considerable segment of trump’s voters it is a ferocious force
955,much of the rage directed at hillary clinton during the campaign came from a similarly primal place
956,here was not just a female candidate but a woman who identifies with and is a product of the movement for women’s liberation and who did not package her quest for power in either cuteness or coyness
957,as the maniacal chants of “lock her up” made clear for many in america it was quite simply unbearable
958,i am no fan of many of clinton’s policies
959,but her policies are not what provoked the seething hatred she encounteredthat came from a deeper place
960,it is not insignificant i think that one of the first big controversies of the campaign was trump’s comment that then fox news anchor megyn kelly who had dared to ask him a tough question about previous sexist comments had “blood coming out of her wherever” this basest of insultsinvoking the ancient idea that women’s menstruation makes them unfit for public lifewas an early clue that the blind rage at women overstepping their allotted boundaries would become a driving force of the campaign
961,it was a hint too about the glue that connects a proud playboy like donald trump with a sexual scold like mike pence who apparently won’t have a meal alone with a female coworker a shared belief that women’s bodies exist to serve men whether as objects of sexual gratification or as babymaking machines
962,and it was a preview of the rooms packed with white men who would soon be making fateful decisions about women’s health and reproductive freedoms
963,the ranking of human life in the 2016 us presidential elections we heard the roar of men who believe they and they alone have the right to rulein public and in private behind closed doors
964,one of the most chilling details about the men who surround trump and who support him most publicly in the media is the number of them who have been accused of beating harassing or sexually abusing women
965,the list includes steve bannon whose exwife told police that he physically and verbally abused her the case was dismissed when his exwife couldn’t be found by prosecutors to act as a witness trump’s original pick for labor secretary andrew puzder whose exwife claimed in court documents that he caused permanent injuries after “striking her violently about the face chest back shoulders and neck without provocation or cause”though she later recanted bill o’reilly of course one of trump’s most powerful champions in the media and roger ailes who worked as an adviser to the trump campaign after being forced to leave fox news following allegations of sexual harassment by more than two dozen women many at his own network and who like o’reilly denied the allegations
966,and the list would be incomplete without trump himself who has been accused by multiple women including in lawsuits of sexual assault and harassment he denies all allegations and whose first wife ivana reportedly swore in a deposition that her husband raped her in 1989 like andrew puzder’s exwife she recanted
967,there is no shortage of sexual predators on the liberal side of the political spectrum but the litany of allegations accusations and hush money that swirls around trump’s inner circle is unlike anything we have seen before
968,no matter the allegation it is met with a wall of denial of powerful men vouching for other powerful men sending a message to the world that women are not to be believed
969,perhaps this shouldn’t come as a surprise given trump’s brand he’s the boss who does what he wantsgrabs what and whomever he wants mocks shames and humiliates whomever he wants whenever he wants
970,that is what the grabberinchief is selling
971,and there is clearly a rather large market for it
972,the problem with “jobs voters” many of trump’s voters were not primarily driven by “whitelash” or “malelash” sentiments
973,plenty of them said they voted for trump because they liked what he said about trade and jobs or because they wanted to stick it to the “swamp” of dc elites
974,but there’s a problem with these stories
975,you cannot cast a ballot for a person who is openly riling up hatred based on race gender or physical ability unless on some level you think those issues aren’t important
976,that the lives of the people being put in tangible danger by this rhetoric and the policies that flow from it matter less than your life and the lives of people who look more like you
977,you just can’t do it unless you are willing to sacrifice those other categories of people for your hopedfor gain
978,to put it bluntly a vote for trump might not reflect active hatred but there is still at best a troubling indifference behind the act
979,the racial and gender resentments that did so much to bring trump to power are not new
980,they have been omnipresent through history rising and falling with additional stresses and provocations
981,there are however deep structural reasons why trump’s version of a very old tactic is resonating so powerfully now at this particular moment
982,some of them have to do with those changes in white male status but that tells only part of the story
983,what really won it for trump was how those losses in social status were layered on top of losses in basic economic security
984,the people who have been hit hardest by neoliberal policies such as slashed social services and banking deregulation are not trump’s white votersnot by a long shot
985,these policies have done far more to compromise the financial status of black and latino families and it is within communities of color that the deepest service cuts have been inflicted
986,moreover the flip side of neoliberal economic policies that exile whole segments of the population from the formal economy has been an explosion of the state apparatus aimed at control and containment militarized police fortressed borders immigration detention and mass incarceration
987,the forty years since the neoliberal revolution began have seen the number of people behind bars in the united states increase by approximately 500 percenta phenomenon once again that disproportionately affects black and brown people though whites are most certainly swept up in the system as well
988,it’s also important to note that trump’s base wasn’t mostly poor it was solidly middleincome with most of his voters earning between 50000 and 200000 a year with a concentration at the lower end of that range
989,since so many trump voters are not destitute some argue that their vote can’t be motivated by economic stress
990,but that misses an important factor
991,a cnn analysis of exit polls found that trump won 77 percent of the vote among those who said that their financial situation was “worse today” than it had been four years earlier
992,in other words they may have been doing well compared with the country’s average but many had lost ground
993,and indeed the losses began long before that
994,insecure on every front over the past three decades but accelerating since the 2008 financial crisis pretty much everyone apart from the one percent has been losing job security as well as whatever feeble safety net used to exist
995,that means a lost job has greater implications now for one’s ability to pay for health care or hold on to a home
996,this state of affairs hurts trump’s workingclass white male voters just as it does so many others
997,on the other hand because many of trump’s bluecollar voters had a notably better deal until fairly recentlyable to access wellpaid unionized manufacturing jobs that supported middleclass lives these losses appear to come as more of a shock
998,this is reflected in a marked rise in deaths among white middle aged americans without college degrees mainly from suicide prescription drug overdoses and alcoholrelated illnesses
999,and this is particular to whites mortality rates for black and hispanic americans in similar demographic brackets are falling
1000,anne case and angus deaton the princeton economists who noticed this trend dating back to 1999 and authored a landmark paper on what they term “deaths of despair” explain the discrepancy as coming down to different prior experiences and expectations or “the failure of life to turn out as expected” another way of thinking about it is when a building starts to collapse it’s the people on the higher floors who have further to fall that’s just physics
1001,on top of those losses there are also the groundshifting uncertainties associated with living in a changing country a nation rapidly becoming more ethnically diverse and where women are gaining more access to power
1002,that’s part of progress toward equality the result of hardfought battles but it does mean that white men are losing economic security which everyone has a right to and their sense of a superior status which they never had a right to at the same time
1003,in the rush to condemn the latter form of entitlement we shouldn’t lose sight of something important not all forms of entitlement are illegitimate
1004,all people are entitled to a dignified life
1005,in wealthy countries it is not greedy or an expression of unearned privilege to expect some basic security in your job when you work hard for decades some certainty that you will be taken care of in old age that you won’t be bankrupted by illness and that your kids will have access to the tools they need to excel
1006,in a decent society people should feel entitled to those things
1007,that’s human privilege
1008,and yet those sorts of entitlements have been under vicious attack by the right for four decades to the extent that the word entitlementsreferring to pensions and health careis a slur in washington dc
1009,it is this complex mix of factors that allowed trump to come along and say i will champion the beleaguered working man
1010,i will get you those manufacturing jobs back
1011,i’ll get rid of these free trade agreements
1012,i’ll return your power to you
1013,i’ll make you a real man again
1014,free to grab women without asking all those boring questions
1015,oh and the most potent part of trump’s promise to his base i will take away the competition from brown people who will be deported or banned and black people who will be locked up if they fight for their rights
1016,in other words he would put white men safely back on top once again
1017,the power of that promise is part of why trump’s election win was like a batsignal for hatemongers of all kinds
1018,the southern poverty law center reported close to a tripling of antimuslim hate groups in 2016 alone
1019,in the month after trump’s election there were more than a thousand reported incidents of hate targeting people of color
1020,thirty twoyearold srinivas kuchibhotla an immigrant engineer from india was shot dead at a bar in olathe kansas by a white man who reportedly yelled “get out of my country” before opening fire
1021,in the first two months of 2017 seven transgender people were murdered prompting calls for a federal hate crimes investigation
1022,to a terrifying degree skin color and gender conformity are determining who is physically safe in the hands of the state who is at risk from vigilante violence who can express themselves without constant harassment who can cross a border without terror and who can worship without fear
1023,the identity blame game which is why it’s shortsighted not to mention dangerous to call for liberals and progressives to abandon their focus on “identity politics” and concentrate instead on economics and classas if these factors could in any way be pried apart
1024,railing against socalled identity politics and political correctness is standard fare on fox news and breitbart news but those aren’t the only places it’s coming from and the critics have only become more vocal since the election
1025,the lesson a great many liberal democrats seem to have taken away from hillary clinton’s defeat is that her direct appeals to women and minorities on the campaign trail made white workingclass men feel left out driving them to trump
1026,columbia university professor mark lilla expressed this most prominently in a postelection essay in the new york times 
1027,he chided clinton for “calling out explicitly to africanamerican latino lgbt and women voters at every stop
1028,this was a strategic mistake” this focus on the traditionally marginalized groups and the “moral panic about racial gender and sexual identityhas distorted liberalism’s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing” unity apparently requires that all those noisy minorities combined an overwhelming majority actually need to pipe down about their individual grievances so democrats can get back to “it’s the economy stupid” the mantra of bill clinton’s 1992 winning presidential campaign
1029,except this is exactly the wrong conclusion to draw from the 2016 elections
1030,clinton’s failure was not one of messaging but of track record
1031,specifically it was the stupid economics of neoliberalism fully embraced by her her husband and her party’s establishment that left clinton without a credible offer to make to those white workers who had voted for obama twice and decided this time to vote trump
1032,true trump’s plans weren’t credible but at least they were different
1033,similarly if there was a problem with her focus on gender sexuality and racial identity it was that clinton’s brand of identity politics does not challenge the system that produced and entrenched these inequalities but seeks only to make that system more “inclusive” so yes to marriage equality and abortion access and transgender bathrooms but forget about the right to housing the right to a wage that supports a family clinton resisted the calls for a 15 minimum wage the universal right to free health care or anything else that requires serious redistribution of wealth from top to bottom and would mean challenging the neoliberal playbook
1034,on the campaign trail clinton mocked her opponent’s “trumpedup trickledown economics” but her own philosophy is what we might call “trickle down identity politics” tweak the system just enough to change the genders colors and sexual orientation of some of the people at the top and wait for the justice to trickle down to everyone else
1035,and it turns out that trickledown works about as well in the identity sphere as it does in the economic one
1036,we know this because it’s been tried
1037,there have been historic symbolic victories for diversity in recent yearsan africanamerican first family two black attorneys general hollywood pushed into recognizing black directors and actors out gays and lesbians working as news anchors and heading fortune 500 companies hit tv shows built around transgender characters an overall increase in the number of women in management positions to name just a few
1038,these victories for diversity and inclusion matter they change lives and bring in viewpoints that would otherwise be absent
1039,it was immensely important that a generation of kids grew up seeing obama in the most powerful office in the world
1040,and yet this topdown approach to change if it is not accompanied by bottomup policies that address systemic issues such as crumbling schools and lack of access to decent housing is not going to lead to real equality
1041,not even close
1042,in the united states the significant gains made for greater diversity and inclusion at the top in recent years have occurred at a time of mass deportations of immigrants and as the wealth gap between black and white americans actually increased
1043,according to the urban institute between 2007 and 2010 the average wealth of white families fell by 11 percent a huge amount but black families saw their wealth fall by 31 percent
1044,in other words blacks and whites became more unequal during a period of tremendous symbolic advancements not less
1045,part of this is because black families were disproportionately targeted for subprime loans so they were hit the hardest when the market collapsed in 2008 during this same period young black men continued to be shot and killed by police at an obscene rate five times higher than white men of the same age bracket according to a study by the guardian  their murders often captured on video and seared into the imaginations of stilldeveloping young minds
1046,it is against this backdrop that black lives matter has become this generation’s civil rights movement
1047,as keeangayamahtta taylor author of from blacklivesmatter to black liberation  writes “the black political establishment led by president barack obama had shown over and over again that it was not capable of the most basic task keeping black children alive
1048,the young people would have to do it themselves” similarly while there are a great many women in positions of powernot enough but substantially more than a generation agolowincome women are working longer hours often at multiple jobs without security just to pay the bills
1049, twothirds of minimumwage workers in the states are women
1050,in the world economic forum’s annual global rankings on the economic gender gap the us fell from the 28th spot in 2015 all the way down to 45th place in 2016 while white trump voters responded to their precariousness by raging at the world many traditional liberals seem to have responded by tuning out
1051,when hillary clinton called out identifiable groups at every rally declaring that she would “stand up” for each of them it was too tepid an offering to build the groundswell of support she needed
1052,so while white identity politics pumped up trump’s base trickledown identity politics fell flat for his opponent
1053,in crucial states such as iowa ohio and wisconsin clinton drew 15 to 20 percent fewer democratic voters than barack obama had in 2012 and that depressed progressive turnout is a big part of how trump managed to eke out an electoral win despite losing the popular vote
1054,so perhaps this is another lesson to draw from 2016 fear of “the other” may be an animating force for many supporters of farright parties but “inclusion” of the other within an inherently unjust system will not be powerful enough to defeat those forces
1055,it wasn’t inspiring enough to galvanize the demoralized democratic base in 2016 or to defeat brexit and there is no reason to believe that dynamic will change anytime soon
1056,instead the overarching task before us is not to rank our various issuesidentity versus economics race versus genderand for one to vanquish all the others in some sort of oppression cage match
1057,it is to understand in our bones how these forms of oppression intersect and prop each other up creating the complex scaffolding that allowed a kleptocratic thug to grab the world’s most powerful job as if it were a hostess at a strip club
1058,“racial capitalism” this is a good time to remember that manufacturing false hierarchies based on race and gender in order to enforce a brutal class system is a very long story
1059,our modern capitalist economy was born thanks to two very large subsidies stolen indigenous land and stolen african people
1060,both required the creation of intellectual theories that ranked the relative value of human lives and labor placing white men at the top
1061,these church and state–sanctioned theories of white and christian supremacy are what allowed indigenous civilizations to be actively “unseen” by european explorersvisually perceived and yet not acknowledged to have preexisting rights to the landand entire richly populated continents to be legally classified as unoccupied and therefore fair game on an absurd “finders keepers” basis
1062,it was these same systems of human ranking that were deployed to justify the mass kidnapping shackling and torturing of other humans in order to force them to work that stolen landwhich led the late political theorist cedric robinson to describe the market economy that gave birth to the united states not simply as capitalism but as “racial capitalism” the cotton and sugar picked by enslaved africans was the fuel that kickstarted the industrial revolution
1063,the ability to discount darker people and darker nations in order to justify stealing their land and labor was foundational and none of it would have been possible without those theories of racial supremacy that gave the whole morally bankrupt system a patina of legal respectability
1064,in other words economics was never separable from “identity politics” certainly not in colonial nations like the united statesso why would it suddenly be today
1065,as the civil rights lawyer michelle alexander wrote in her book the new jim crow  the politics of racial hierarchy have been the ever present accomplices to the market system as it evolved through the centuries
1066,elites in the united states have used race as a wedge she writes “to decimate a multiracial alliance of poor people”first in the face of slave rebellions supported by white workers then with jim crow laws and later during the socalled war on drugs
1067,every time these multiethnic coalitions have become powerful enough to threaten corporate power white workers have been convinced that their real enemies are darkerskinned people stealing “their” jobs or threatening their neighborhoods
1068,and there has been no more effective way to convince white voters to support the defunding of schools bus systems and welfare than by telling them however wrongly that most of the beneficiaries of those services are darkerskinned people many of them “illegal” out to scam the system
1069,in europe fearmongering about how migrants are stealing jobs exploiting social services and eroding the culture has played a similarly enabling role
1070,ronald reagan kicked this into high gear in the united states with the myth that food stamps were being collected by furwearing cadillacdriving “welfare queens” and used to subsidize a culture of crime
1071,and trump was no small player in this hysteria
1072,in 1989 after five black and latino teenagers were accused of raping a white woman in central park he bought fullpage ads in several new york daily papers calling for the return of the death penalty
1073,the central park five were later exonerated by dna evidence and their sentences were vacated
1074,trump refused to apologize or retract his claims
1075,no wonder then that his justice department under the direction of attorney general jeff sessions is arguing that social services and infrastructure in cities such as new york and chicago are “crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime”conveniently moving the subject away from years of neoliberal neglect toward the supposed need to crack down on crime and to bar these cities from declaring themselves “sanctuaries” for immigrants
1076,divide and conquer in truth nothing has done more to help build our present corporate dystopia than the persistent and systematic pitting of workingclass whites against blacks citizens against migrants and men against women
1077,white supremacy misogyny homophobia and transphobia have been the elite’s most potent defenses against genuine democracy
1078,a divideandterrorize strategy alongside ever more creative regulations that make it harder for many minorities to vote is the only way to carry out a political and economic agenda that benefits such a narrow portion of the population
1079,we also know from history that white supremacist and fascist movementsthough they may always burn in the backgroundare far more likely to turn into wildfires during periods of sustained economic hardship and national decline
1080,that is the lesson of weimar germany whichravaged by war and humiliated by punishing economic sanctionsbecame ripe for nazism
1081,that warning was supposed to have echoed through the ages
1082,after the holocaust the world came together to try to create conditions that would prevent genocidal logic from ever again taking hold
1083,it was this combined with significant pressure from below that formed the rationale for generous social programs throughout europe
1084,western powers embraced the principle that market economies needed to guarantee enough basic dignity that disillusioned citizens would not go looking for scapegoats or extreme ideologies
1085,but all that has been discarded and we are allowing conditions eerily similar to those in the 1930s to be recreated today
1086,since the 2008 financial crisis the international monetary fund imf the european commission and the european central bank known as the “troika” have forced country after country to accept “shock therapy”– style reforms in exchange for desperately needed bailout funds
1087,to countries such as greece italy portugal and even france they said “sure we’ll bail you out but only in exchange for your abject humiliation
1088,only in exchange for you giving up control over your economic affairs only if you delegate all key decisions to us only if you privatize large parts of your economy including parts of your economy that are seen as central to your identity like your mineral wealth
1089,only if you accept cuts to salaries and pensions and health care” there is a bitter irony here because the imf was created after world war ii with the express mandate of preventing the kinds of economic punishment that fueled so much resentment in germany after world war i and yet it was an active part of the process that helped create the conditions for neofascist parties to gain ground in greece belgium france hungary slovakia and so many other countries
1090,our current financial system is spreading economic humiliation all over the world and it’s having the precise effects that the economist and diplomat john maynard keynes warned of a century ago when he wrote that if the world imposed punishing economic sanctions on germany “vengeance i dare predict will not limp” i understand the urge to boil trump’s election down to just one or two causes
1091,to say it is all simply an expression of the ugliest forces in the united states which never went away and roared to the foreground when a demagogue emerged who tore off the mask
1092,to say it is all about race a blind rage at the loss of white privilege
1093,or to say that it’s all attributable to womenhatred since the very fact that hillary clinton could have been defeated by so vile and ignorant a figure as trump is a wound that for a great many women refuses to heal
1094,but the reduction of the current crisis to just one or two factors at the exclusion of all else won’t get us any closer to understanding how to defeat these forces now or the next time out
1095,if we cannot become just a little bit curious about how all these elementsrace gender class economics history culturehave intersected with one another to produce the current crisis we will at best be stuck where we were before trump won
1096,and that was not a safe place
1097,because already before trump we had a culture that treats both people and planet like so much garbage
1098,a system that extracts lifetimes of labor from workers and then discards them without protection
1099,that treats millions of people excluded from economic opportunity as refuse to be thrown away inside prisons
1100,that treats government as a resource to be mined for private wealth leaving wreckage behind
1101,that treats the land water and air that sustain all of life as little more than a bottomless sewer
1102,lovelessness as policy the author and intellectual cornel west has said that “justice is what love looks like in public” i often think that neoliberalism is what lovelessness looks like as policy
1103,it looks like generations of children overwhelmingly black and brown raised amidst an uncaring landscape
1104,it looks like the ratinfested schools of detroit
1105,it looks like water pipes leaking lead and poisoning young minds in flint
1106,it looks like foreclosed mortgages on homes that were built to collapse
1107,it looks like famished hospitals that feel more like jailsand overstuffed jails that are humanity’s best approximation of hell
1108,it looks like trashing the beauty of the planet as if it had no value at all
1109,it is much like trump himself greed and carelessness incarnate
1110,while our global economic model is failing the vast majority of people on the planet it is not failing all of us equally
1111,the hatred that trump and his team are helping to direct at the most vulnerable is not a separate project from their economic pillage on behalf of the ultra rich their corporate coupthe former enables the latter
1112,trump’s ugliness on race and gender serves a specific set of wildly profitable goals as identitybased hatreds always have
1113,fortunately the fastestgrowing grassroots political formations of our erafrom the movement to end violence against women to the movement for black lives from workers calling for a living wage to indigenous rights and climate justice movementsare rejecting a singleissue approach
1114,they have embraced the “intersectionality” framework articulated by feminist and civil rights advocate kimberlé williams crenshaw
1115,that means identifying how multiple issues race gender income sexuality physical ability immigration status languageintersect and overlap within an individual’s life experience and also within structures of power
1116,the trump administration does not choose between amping up law and order attacking women’s reproductive rights escalating foreign conflicts scapegoating immigrants setting off a fossil fuel frenzy and otherwise deregulating the economy in the interests of the superrich
1117,they are proceeding on all these fronts and others simultaneously knowing them to be component parts of the singular project of “making america great again” which is why any opposition that is serious about taking on trump or other farright forces like him around the world must embrace the task of telling a new history of how we ended up here in this perilous moment
1118,a history that compellingly shows the role played by the politics of division and separation
1119,racial divisions
1120,class divisions
1121,gender divisions
1122,citizenship divisions
1123,and a false division between humans and the natural world
1124,only then will it become possible to truly come together to win the world we need
1125,chapter six politics hates a vacuum there have been a lot of lowlights in trump’s short presidency so far from candlelit ballistic missile summits at maralago to unfiltered angry tweets about department stores
1126,but from a resistance perspective it’s still hard to beat the low reached on trump’s first full day at the office on the monday after inauguration
1127,that’s when a group of smiling us union leaders strolled out of the white house and up to a bank of waiting cameras and declared their allegiance to donald trump
1128,sean mcgarvey president of north america’s building trades unions reported that trump had taken the delegation representing more than half a dozen unions on a tour of the oval office showing a level of respect that was “nothing short of incredible” more praise came from doug mccarron president of the united brotherhood of carpenters
1129,he described trump’s inaugural addressjudged by most to have been a belligerent spokentweet stormas “a great moment for working men and women” it was hard to watch
1130,trump was already waging war on the most vulnerable workers in the economy and there was talk of budget cuts so draconian they would mean mass layoffs for public sector workers like bus drivers
1131,so why were these labor leaders representing around a quarter of all unionized workers in the united states breaking the most sacred principle of the union movementsolidarity with other workers
1132,most of the unions whose leaders toured the white house had been loyal to the democrats for decades
1133,why choose this moment when so many were in pain to heap praise on donald trump
1134,well they explained that part of their deal with the devil had to do with trump’s energy plansall those pipelines
1135,and some of it had to do with trump’s pledge to spend on infrastructure though it went unsaid they may even have been buoyed by talk of spending 21 billion on the border wall with mexico
1136,but the clincher the union heads were clear was that here finally was a president who had their backs on free trade
1137,indeed trump had wasted no time on that front
1138,that same day shortly before meeting with the union delegation he signed an executive order withdrawing the united states from the transpacific partnership the elevencountry trade deal that he’d railed against on the campaign trail as the “rape of our country” at the signing ceremony where the us officially left the tpp trump announced “it’s a great thing for the american worker” subsequently a few people wrote to me to ask if this might be the silver lining in trump’s presidency
1139,wasn’t it a good thing that trade deals that many progressives had been criticizing for decades were now on the chopping block or like the north american free trade agreement set to be reopened and renegotiated to “bring the jobs back”
1140,i understand the desire to find bright sides to the daily chaos unfolding in the white house
1141,but trump’s trade plans are not one of them
1142,the whole thing reminds me of all the liberal hawks who backed george w bush’s invasion of iraq because the war coincided with their desire to liberate iraqis from saddam husseinthe “humanitarian intervention” argument
1143,there was nothing in the bush cheney track record or worldview to suggest there would be anything democratic or humanitarian about their invasion and occupation of iraqand sure enough the occupation rapidly became the site of killing fields and torture committed by the us military and its contractors as well as outofcontrol war profiteering
1144,so what is there in trump’s track record in his treatment of his own workers in the appointments he has made in the procorporate policies he has already pushed through that should cause anyone to believe that the way he will renegotiate trade deals or “bring back the jobs” will in any way be in the interests of workers or the environment
1145,rather than hope that trump is going to magically transform into bernie sanders and choose this one arena in which to be a genuine advocate for anyone who isn’t related to him we would do far better to ask some tough questions about how it’s been possible for a gang of unapologetic plutocrats with open disdain for democratic norms to hijack an issue like corporate free trade in the first place
1146,the race to the bottom trump has made trade deals a signature issue for two reasons
1147,the first on full display that day at the white house is that it’s a great way to steal votes from the democrats
1148,the rightwing pundit charles krauthammerno fan of unionsdeclared on fox news that trump’s cozy union summit was a “great act of political larceny” the second reason is that trumpwho we know believes his own supernegotiator prhas said he can negotiate better deals than his predecessors
1149,but here’s the catch by “better” he doesn’t mean better for unionized workers and certainly not better for the environment
1150,he means better in the same way he always means betterbetter for him and his corporate empire better for the bankers and oil executives who make up his administration
1151,in other words trade rules if trump gets his way are about to get a lot worse for regular peoplenot just in the united states but around the world
1152,you only have to look at what trump has done since taking office
1153,on the same day he flattered the union leaders by giving them a private tour he also met with business leaders and announced plans to cut regulations by 75 percent and cut taxes for corporations to 15 percent
1154,it’s workers who pay the price for policies like this
1155,without regulations their jobs become more unsafe with more onthejob injuries and it’s workers who use the services that are getting slashed to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy
1156,trump has already reneged on his promise to make sure the keystone xl pipeline would be built with american steel an early indication of the depth of his commitment to “buy american hire american” there is also every reason to suspect that the administration’s plans to attract manufacturing back to the states will rely on rolling back many of the protections that unions have won over the last century including the remaining protections for the right to bargain collectively
1157,many around trump have pushed hard to make it more difficult for unions to organize particularly with socalled rightto work legislation and with republicans in control of the house and senate that priority will remain on the agenda
1158,the long list of gifts the trump administration has already handed out to corporate america makes it clear that trump’s strategy for “making america great again” by reviving manufacturing is to make american manufacturing cheap again
1159,without all those pesky regulations with far lower corporate tax rates with trump’s allout assault on environmental protections american workers will indeed be closer to competing on cost with workers in lowwage countries like mexico
1160,trump told us all we needed to know about his attitude toward workers with his first pick for labor secretary the cabinet post that is supposed to protect the us workforce
1161,he chose andrew puzdera nomination that ultimately failed but one so egregious that it’s worth recalling as a marker of trump’s intentions
1162,puzder is the ceo of a restaurant empire that includes the fastfood chains hardee’s and carl’s jr and he is widely considered to be among the most abusive employers in the country
1163,dozens of lawsuits have alleged that his company and its franchises have failed to pay workers for overtime and other work leading to millions in settlements
1164,the correct term for this is wage theft 
1165,he has also mused publicly about the benefits of working with machines instead of workers “they never take a vacation they never show up late there’s never a slipandfall or an age sex or race discrimination case” he told business insider 
1166,senate minority leader charles schumer called puzder worth an estimated 45 million “probably the most antiworker” choice ever
1167,what trump’s admiration for puzder suggests is that his real plan for luring back manufacturing is to suppress rights wages and protections to such a degree that working in a factory will be a lot like working at hardee’s under andrew puzder
1168,in other words it’s yet another plan to take from the vulnerable to benefit the already outrageously rich
1169,what we are witnessing is not a silver lining of any sort
1170,it’s the push to the finish line in the “race to the bottom” that opponents of these corporate trade deals always feared
1171,yes it’s possible to make bad trade deals worse trump is not planning to remove the parts of trade deals that are most damaging to workersthe parts for instance that prohibit policies which are designed to favor local over foreign production
1172,or the parts that allow corporations to sue national governments if they introduce lawsincluding laws designed to create jobs and protect workersthat businesses deem to be unfairly cutting into their profits
1173,contrary to campaign pledges to penalize companies that move production outside the united states the actual plan seems to be to expand protections for corporations that move production offshore
1174,this is not speculation
1175,just two months into the new presidency a draft letter was leaked of the administration’s notice to congress stating its intent to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement nafta 
1176,according to public citizen’s global trade watch’s analysis the administration plans to take the worst elements of the transpacific partnership and add them to or strengthen them in nafta while not even scrapping the language that denies the us the right to implement “buy american” rules
1177,as lori wallach director of global trade watch put it “for those who trusted trump’s pledge to make nafta ‘much better’ for working people it’s a punch in the face” one of the most insidious parts of many trade deals is the aggressive protection they provide for patents and trademarks which often puts lifesaving drugs and critical technologies out of reach for the poor
1178,the trumps have built a global empire that relies above all else on being granted trademarks and licenses and having them fiercely protected so we can expect the parts of deals concerning intellectual property to become more harmful not less
1179,the strongest evidence of trump’s plans is the person he has chosen to oversee his trade negotiations
1180,his commerce secretary is wilbur ross a former banker and billionaire venture capitalist who made a fortune taking over firms and restructuring them to make them more profitablea feat almost invariably accomplished by laying off workers and moving production to cheaper locations
1181,in 2004 for example he bought cone mills an american textile company
1182,after less than a decade of restructuring corporate mergers and outsourcing the us workforce in one north carolina factory dropped from over 1000 to just 300 while ross expanded production in china and mexico
1183,putting a ceo like ross in charge of trade is just one more example of the corporate coupcutting out any pretense of a neutral government mediator and instead placing corporations directly in charge of the final stage of the decimation of the public sphere and the public interest
1184,if this agenda is fully realized workers in the united states will find themselves with fewer protections than they have had at any point since the dickensian nightmares of the gilded age
1185,but resistance is rising
1186,andrew puzder was forced to withdraw his nomination for labor secretary in part because of organizing by restaurant workers across the country
1187,and when trump was invited to address a convention of two thousand members of north america’s building trades unions the organization that had sung his praises at the white house a group of workers decided they were fed up with their union’s decision to cozy up to the “billionaireinchief” when trump spoke to the room packed with union members they stood up turned their backs on him and held up signs that said resistuntil they were removed by security
1188,not all trade unions have fallen for trump’s trade swindle
1189,most labor leaders particularly those representing multiracial workforces including national nurses united unions representing public transit workers and the service employees international unionunderstand that trump represents an existential threat to their movement and are organizing accordingly
1190,and yet the earlier question remains how could trump’s transparently absurd posture as a champion of the working man find a ready audience with a notinsubstantial part of the us labor movement in the first place
1191,a large part of the answer has to do with the fact that much of this political battleground has been ceded by liberals to the right
1192,remembering a powerful global movement beginning in the 1990s i was part of a global movement warning that corporate free trade agreements and the model of global commerce they accelerated were leading to a level of human dispossession and environmental destruction that would rapidly be untenable
1193,it was a multigenerational movement that spanned dozens of countries and sectors bringing together nonprofit organizations radical anarchists indigenous communities churches trade unions and more
1194,it was messy ideologically inchoate imperfectbut it was also large and for a time powerful enough to clock some major wins
1195,indeed it came close to being in some important ways the kind of broadbased coalition that is needed at the present moment to take on the pseudopopulist right
1196,so now seems like a good time to look at the lessons of our movement’s riseand fall
1197,because if that movement had been able to translate its street power into more policy victories it would have been unthinkable for trump and his corporate cabinet to tap into the rage at unfair global trade rules and wrap themselves in the cloak of “fair trade” in the late 1990s through to the early 2000s from london to genoa to mumbai to buenos aires quebec city and miami there could not be a highlevel gathering to advance the neoliberal economic agenda without count erdem onstr atio ns
1198,that’s what happened in seattle during a summit of the world trade organization where the city was completely shut down by protesters derailing the meetings
1199,it happened a few months later at the annual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington and at summits to push the free trade area of the americas a deal that would have stretched from alaska to tierra del fuego
1200,and this movement was no small thing by july 2001 roughly 300000 people were on the streets of genoa during a g8 meeting
1201,unlike today’s hypernationalist rightwing movements that rail against “globalism” our movement was proudly international and internationalist using the novelty of a stillyoung internet to organize easily across national borders online and face to face
1202,finding common ground in how those deals were increasing inequality and looting the public sphere in all our countries we called for open borders for people the liberation of medicines seeds and crucial technologies from restrictive patent protections and far more controls over corporations
1203,at its core the movement was about deep democracy from local to global and it stood in opposition to what we used to call “corporate rule”a frame more relevant today than ever
1204,our objection was obviously not to trade cultures have always traded goods across borders and always will
1205,we objected to the way transnational institutions were using trade deals to globalize procorporate policies that were extremely profitable for a small group of players but which were steadily devouring so much of what used to be public and commonly held seeds water rights public health care and much more
1206,one of the early fights that typified what was at stake involved the bolivian city of cochabamba and the american corporation bechtel
1207,as part of the push to privatize the city’s services bechtel won a contract to run the local water system
1208,as a result prices for this most essential of services soared and it was even deemed illegal to collect rainwater without special permission
1209,residents of cochabamba rose up in what became known as “the water war” and threw bechtel out of the country
1210,but then bechtel turned around and sued bolivia for 50 million in damages and lost revenue
1211,so even when the people reclaimed their democratic rights over this corporation they were still vulnerable to brutal claims in trade court
1212,which is why we saw trade policy as such a core fight between democracy and oligarchy
1213,anyone who has paid attention during trump’s first months in office or seen who he has surrounded himself with knows that he is not going to reverse these trends but accelerate them
1214,teamsters and turtlestogether at last
1215,one area of concern was how these deals were leading to devastating job losses leaving behind rust belts from detroit to buenos aires while companies such as ford and toyota looked for evercheaper places to produce
1216,but for the most part our opposition was not grounded in trumpstyle protectionism it was trying to stem the beginning of what already looked like a race to the bottom a new world order that was negatively impacting workers and the environment in every country
1217,we were arguing for a model of trade that would start with the imperative to protect people and the planet
1218,that was crucial thenit’s urgent now
1219,the movement was even starting to win
1220,we defeated the proposed free trade area of the americas
1221,we brought world trade organization negotiations to a standstill
1222,and the world bank and the international monetary fund could no longer speak of “structural adjustment”meaning forcing neoliberalism on poor countriesin the open
1223,looking back one of the reasons we succeeded was that we stopped fixating on our differences and came together across sectors and national borders to fight for a common goal
1224,there were plenty of conflicts over tactics and environmentalists and trade unionists still had large areas of disagreement
1225,in spite of that however on the streets of seattle you had trade unions like the teamsters marching alongside environmentalists under the banner teamsters and turtles together at last
1226,that’s a long way from those trade union leaders outside the white house cheering on trump
1227,shocked out of the way so what the hell happened
1228,the short answer is shock happened
1229,the september 11 attacks and the whole era of the socalled war on terror pretty much wiped our movement off the map in north america and european experience that started me off on an exploration of the political uses and misuses of crisis that has gripped me ever since
1230,of course the movement never disappeared completely and many organizations and good people continued to work diligently to raise the alarm about new unfair trade deals
1231,in latin america opposition forces came into government in such countries as bolivia and ecuador and set up their own “fair trade” networks
1232,but in the global north we rapidly ceased to be an unignorable mass movement that changed the conversation in dozens of countries
1233,after september 11 2001 we suddenly found ourselves under attack from politicians and media commentators equating rowdy anticorporate street demonstrations and yes there had been battles with the police and broken store windows with the deranged forces that had staged the attacks on the world trade center
1234,it was a vile comparison entirely without basis
1235,but it didn’t matter
1236,our movement had always been a very big tenta “movement of movements” as we called it a phrase that has come back into the lexicon
1237,but after september 11 large parts of the coalition got spooked by the “with us or with the terrorists” rhetoric
1238,the nonprofits who rely on large foundations feared losing their funding and withdrew as did some key unions
1239,almost overnight people went back to their singleissue silos and this remarkable if imperfect cross sectoral alliance which had brought together such a diversity of people under a prodemocracy umbrella virtually disappeared
1240,this left a vacuum for trump and farright parties in europe to step in exploit the justified rage at loss of control to unaccountable transnational institutions direct it toward immigrants and muslims and anyone else who makes an easy target and take the project of corporate rule into new and uncharted waters
1241,many stayed active in this period and joined other broad coalitions but by comparison these were thin and tactical “defeat bush” “stop the war” the deeper analysis of the global economic forces we were all up against regardless of which party was in power was largely lost
1242,vacuum meet trump this is important to remember because there’s a real risk today of repeating those mistakesof coming together around lowest commondenominator demands such as “impeach trump” or “elect democrats” and in the process losing our focus on the conditions and politics that allowed trump’s rise and are fueling the growth of far right parties around the world
1243,one thing we know for certain from the bush years is that saying no is not enough
1244,i’ll never forget that just a few days after the september 11 attacks the national post a rightwing paper in canadaran a story headlined antiglobalization is so yesterday 
1245,they couldn’t wait to bury our movement
1246,but they were spectacularly wrongthere is nothing “yesterday” about the alarm we raised
1247,the pain and dislocation didn’t go away just because the media decided it was time to talk about terrorism 247
1248,on the contrary the crises deepened forcing millions to leave their homes in search of a better life
1249,a 2017 study from the center for economic and policy research found that mexico’s poverty rate has risen since the 1994 implementation of nafta  with 20 million additional people now living in povertya major factor pushing mexican migration to the united states
1250,meanwhile in north america and europe white workers grew progressively more pissed off at having their voices ignored
1251,this opened the space for demagogues like trump to step in and direct workers’ rage away from plutocrats like him who had profited so lavishly from the outsourcing opportunities enabled by these deals and at mexican migrants instead victims of the same policies that were hollowing out their communities the very same bad deals
1252,this is the space the brexit campaign usurped under its slogan “take back control” and it is the same rage that france’s marine le pen of the farright front national speaks to when she tells crowds that globalization has meant “manufacturing by slaves for selling to the unemployed” around the world farright forces are gaining ground by harnessing the power of nostalgic nationalism and anger directed at remote economic bureaucracieswhether washington nafta  the wto or the euand mixing it with racism and xenophobia offering an illusion of control through bashing immigrants vilifying muslims and degrading women
1253,it’s a toxic combination and it was an avoidable one
1254,confronting the cruelties of a system designed by and for the wealthiest interests on earth is terrain that rightly belongs to the left
1255,but the hard truth is that after september 11 large parts of the progressive side of the political spectrum got spooked and that left the economicpopulist space open to abuse
1256,politics hates a vacuum if it isn’t filled with hope someone will fill it with fear
1257, the good news is that the progressive antifreetrade coalition has finally started to revive in the past couple of years
1258,in europe particularly in germany france and belgiumthere has been a big recent surge of unions and environmentalists coming together to oppose corporate trade deals with the united states and canada
1259,bernie sanders meanwhile came out powerfully against the trans pacific partnership slamming it as “part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and wall street by outsourcing jobs undercutting worker rights dismantling labor environmental health food safety and financial laws and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system” if sanders had run against trump on that message he might well have peeled away some of the white and latino workers who ended up voting republican in 2016 but sanders didn’t run against trump hillary clinton did
1260,and with her long history of both backing and personally negotiating precisely these sorts of deals she had no credibility when she criticized them on the campaign trail
1261,whenever she tried it became one more opportunity to paint her as a typical shifty politician
1262,the perils of ceding the populist ground tired of the betrayals some gave up on centrist parties and voted for selfstyled “outsiders” and “insurgents” like trump
1263,many more around the world have just given up periodstaying home during elections disengaging from electoral politics convinced that the whole system is rigged and is never going to help improve their lives
1264,this phenomenon was most evident in the united states in the 2016 elections when despite unprecedented walltowall coverage despite the presence of a flamboyant and dangerous demagogue in the race and despite the chance to make history by voting in the first woman president approximately 90 million eligible votingage americans shrugged and decided to stay home instead
1265,far more wouldbe voters chose not to voteroughly 40 percentthan chose to cast a ballot for either hillary clinton or donald trump who each got roughly 25 percent of total eligible voters
1266,that is a staggering level of disengagement in a democracy
1267,which brings us back to those labor leaders at the white house
1268,yes it was a deal with the devil
1269,but the mere fact that these union heads were willing to align themselves with an administration as regressive as trump’s reflects the systemic neglect of and disdain for workers that has characterized both the democratic and republican parties for decades
1270,no oprah and zuckerberg will not save us trump’s path to the white house was partially paved by two men who are beloved by many us liberalsbill clinton and bill gates
1271,that may seem counterintuitive but bear with me
1272,donald trump stood before the world and proclaimed he had one qualification to be president i’m rich 
1273,to be more specific he said “part of the beauty of me is that i’m very rich” he presented his wealth as evidence that he was “very smart” and indeed superior in every respect
1274,so magical were the powers that flowed from the mere fact of having accumulated this much cash how much we don’t know that it would surely compensate for complete political inexperience or lack of the most basic administrative or historical knowledge
1275,once in office he extended this logic to other members of the superrich club filling his government with individuals whose sole qualification for public office was their enormous often inherited wealth
1276,above all trump extended the equation of wealth with magical powers to members of his own dynastic family bestowing on sonin law jared kushner a real estate developer born a multimillionaire a portfolio so overstuffed with weighty responsibilities it rapidly became a media joke
1277,tallying up the duties so farbrokering middle east peace planning the maralago summit with china monitoring us activities in iraq ordering drone strikes on yemen making government run more like a business new york times columnist frank bruni wondered “why don’t we just stitch him a red cape put him in spandex affix a stylized ‘s’ to his chest and be done with it
1278,superjared has taken flight” it would be reassuring if we could pin this billionaireassavior complex on trump’s twitteraddled brain or on his advisers at the heritage foundation with their ayn randian worship of “free enterprise” and men who build tall things
1279,but the fact is trump and kushner are not the first to imagine that their great wealth endows them with marvel comiclike superpowers nor the first to be encouraged in their delusions
1280,for two decades now elite liberals have been looking to the billionaire class to solve the problems we used to address with collective action and a strong public sectora phenomenon sometimes called “phila nthro capit alism” billionaire ceos and celebritiesbill gates richard branson michael bloomberg mark zuckerberg oprah and always for some reason bonoare treated less like normal people who are gifted in their fields and happen to be good at making a great deal of money and more like demigods
1281,business insider ran a listicle in 2011 headlined “10 ways bill gates is saving the world”a perfect distillation of the enormous powers and responsibilities being delegated to and projected upon this tiny clique and their charitable foundations
1282,the gates foundation alone is worth 40 billion making it the largest charitable organization in the world
1283,in key sectors including agriculture in africa infectious diseases and the us education system the foundation’s power rivals that of major united nations and us government agencies
1284,and yet despite this unprecedented influence the foundation’s inner workings are notoriously secretive with key decisions made by bill his wife melinda his father william gates and fellow multibillionaire warren buffett a nepotistic hiring policy worthy of the trumps
1285,and it’s worth remembering that gates was not always seen as a world savior
1286,indeed in the 1990s gates was widely regarded as a corporate villain known for exploitative employment practices and for building what looked like a predatory software monopoly
1287,then with flashlike speed he reinvented himself as a global superhero one who could singlehandedly fix the most intractable of social crises
1288,never mind whether gates has any specific expertise in the areas in question or that many of the gates foundation’s silverbullet fixes have backfired badly
1289,gates and his fellow worldsaving billionaires are part of what has come to be known as “the davos class” named for the annual world economic summit held at the top of a mountain in davos switzerland
1290,this is the hyperconnected network of banking and tech billionaires elected leaders who are cozy with those interests and hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous
1291,at davos’s 2017 summit for example shakira spoke about her charitable work on education in colombia and celebrity chef jamie oliver discussed his plan to fight diabetes and obesity
1292,gates featured prominently as always announcing with other partners a new 460million fund to fight the spread of infectious disease
1293,the power of the davos class exploded in the 1990s with us president bill clinton and uk prime minister tony blair as charter members
1294,once out of office both blair and clinton continued their involvement
1295,the clinton foundation established the annual clinton global initiative a kind of “davos on the hudson” featuring a continuous parade of oligarchs who rather than pay their taxes at a fair rate publicly shared their plans to fix the world out of the goodness of their hearts
1296,for many the clinton foundation was the embodiment of the public merger of the democratic partythe traditional party of workers and unionswith the wealthiest interests in the world
1297,its mission can be summarized like this there is now so much private wealth sloshing around our planet that every single problem on earth no matter how large can be solved by convincing the ultrarich to do the right things with their loose change
1298,naturally the people to convince them to do these fine things were the clintons the ultimate relationship brokers and deal makers with the help of an entourage of alist celebrities
1299,for those involved it no doubt seemed righteous
1300,and yet for multitudes around the world the whole davos class came to symbolize the idea that success was a party to which they were not invited and they knew in their hearts that this rising wealth and power was somehow connected to their growing debts and powerlessness and the increasing precariousness of their children’s futures
1301,the fact that politicians who promised to protect working people’s interests were so entangled with the davos class only increased the rage
1302,the debate over barack obama accepting 400000 for a speech to a wall street audience needs to be understood in this context
1303,trump didn’t run with the davos crowd indeed he tapped into the rage against it
1304,and many from that glamorous liberalleaning world are horrified by the trump presidency
1305,yet the precedents set by mountaintop dogooderism are part of the reason it became fathomable for trump to run in the first place and for millions of americans to vote to hand over their government directly to a man whose sole qualification for the job was his wealth
1306,this is not just about those who cast ballots for trump
1307,a great many of us who would never have voted for him have grown numbly accustomed to the notion that the mere fact of an individual having a large bank account or many bank accounts lots of them hidden offshore somehow means they have bottomless expertise
1308,indeed governments of all stripes have been happy to hand over more and more of what used to be seen as public policy challenges to a tiny group of very highnet worth individuals
1309,trump’s assertion that he knows how to fix america because he’s rich is nothing more than an uncouth vulgar echo of a dangerous idea we have been hearing for years that bill gates can fix africa
1310,or that richard branson and michael bloomberg can solve climate change
1311,the breaking point bailing out the banks the divide between the davos class and everyone else has been widening since the 1980s
1312,but for a lot of people the breaking point came with the 2008 financial crisis
1313,after forcing decades of grinding austerity on people treasury secretaries and finance ministers and chancellors of the exchequer suddenly found trillions of dollars to rescue the banks people witnessed their governments printing vast sums of money
1314,they had given up so muchpensions wages decent schoolswhen in fact contrary to what margaret thatcher claimed there were alternatives
1315,all of a sudden it turned out that governments can do all kinds of things to interfere in the market and have seemingly unlimited resources with which to help you out if only you are rich enough
1316,at that moment everyone on earth saw that they had been lied to
1317,the implications of this unmasking are still reverberating
1318,the anger that is roiling electorates on both the right and left sides of the political spectrum is not only about what’s been lost
1319,it’s also about the injustice of it all knowing that the wrenching losses of our era are not being shared that the davos class were never really looking after those at the bottom of the mountain
1320,which means that defeating the rising pseudopopulist right is not just a matter of electoral strategy not just about finding the right candidates
1321,it’s about being willing to engage in a battle of ideas during and more importantly between electionsthat will take on the corrosive and deeply bipartisan wealthworshiping worldview that created the backlash in the first place
1322,unless progressives learn to speak to the legitimate rage at the grotesque levels of inequality that exist right now the right is going to keep winning
1323,there is no superhero enlightened billionaire coming to save us from the villains in power
1324,not oprah not zuckerberg and not elon musk
1325,we’re going to have to save ourselves by coming together as never before
1326,and in 2016 we caught a glimpse of that potential
1327,chapter seven learn to love economic populism bernie sanders is the only candidate for us president i have ever openly backed
1328,i’ve never felt entirely comfortable with candidate endorsements
1329,i made an exception in 2016 because for the first time in my voting life there was a candidate inside the democratic party primaries who was speaking directly to the triple crises of neoliberalism economic inequality and climate change
1330,the fact that his campaign caught fire in that context where he could not be smeared as a spoiler or votesplitter though many tried anyway is what made his campaign different
1331,bernie was not a protest candidate once he pulled off an early upset by winning new hampshire the game was on
1332,it was suddenly clear that contrary to all received wisdom including my own sanders had a shot at beating hillary clinton and becoming the presidential candidate for the democratic party
1333,in the end he carried more than twenty states with 13 million votes
1334,for a selfdescribed democratic socialist that represents a seismic shift in the political map
1335,many national polls showed that sanders had a better chance of beating trump than clinton did though that might have changed had he won the primary and faced a full rightwing onslaught
1336,bernie was incredibly well suited to this moment of popular outrage and rejection of establishment politics
1337,he was able to speak directly to the indignation over legalized political corruption but from a progressive perspectivewith genuine warmth and without personal malice
1338,that’s rare
1339,he championed policies that would have reined in the banks and made education affordable again
1340,he railed against the injustice that the bankers had never been held accountable
1341,and after a lifetime in politics he was untainted by corruption scandals
1342,that’s even more rare
1343,precisely because bernie is about as far as you can get from the polished world of celebrity reality tv it would have been hard to find a better foil for trump and the excesses of the maralago set
1344,during the campaign one of the early images that went viral was of sanders on a plane white hair disheveled crammed into an economy class middle seat
1345,running that kind of candidate against a man in a private jet with big gold letters on the side would have been the campaign of the century
1346,and it’s clear that people are still drawn to the contrast two months into trump’s term a fox news poll found that sanders had the highest net favorability rating of any politician in the country
1347,the reason it’s worth going over these facts is that when a candidate like that presents him or herself and when that candidate proves that with the right backing and support they could conceivably win it’s worth understanding what stood in the wayso that the mistakes aren’t repeated
1348,because in 2016 there wasalmosta transformative option on the ballot and there could actually be one next time
1349,fear of the unruly masses and unruly tresses
1350,this is not an argument about whether or not people should have voted for hillary against trump
1351,this is about whether there could have been a candidate on the ballot not just more capable of beating trump but more capable at getting at some of the underlying forces that supercharged trump’s rise
1352,for me the tragedy of trump is not only that the united states is now led by a man who represents the worst of all that the culture is capable of all of it bundled into one human being
1353,it’s that the country was within reach of the best and most hopeful political possibility to emerge in my lifetime imperfect as sanders is and just as the climate clock was about to strike midnight
1354,so why couldn’t he connect with enough voters to go over the top
1355,i get that staunch neoliberals in the democratic party didn’t want sanders
1356,he’s a threat to that whole model and his economic populism caused deep discomfort in many high places
1357,so i won’t spend time here rehashing how the democratic national committee sabotaged bernie’s campaign exchanging information and strategy with the clinton camp to serve that purpose
1358,but his campaign was also forcefully attacked by people who are progressive
1359,some looked in the eye of a candidate who was promising to materially and seriously improve the lives of working people across the country and turn climate change into a generational mission and chose to back clinton the candidate of an untenable status quo instead
1360,the hostility of so many powerful us liberals to bernie sanders and the determination to hold him back when he was on a winning streakwas both troubling and revealing
1361,because we so often hear that while they personally support bolder policies to fight inequality those policies aren’t worth championing because the american public is too conservative too procapitalist and would never support them
1362,so they back establishment candidates in the name of pragmatism choosing the person with the best chance of winning against republicans
1363,yet bernie showed that positions previously dismissed as too radical for anything but the fringe leftsuch as universal public health care and breaking up the banks and forgiving student debt and free college tuition and keeping fossil fuels in the ground and getting to 100 percent renewable energywere wildly popular in the most capitalist country on earth supported by millions of people
1364,he showed that transformational change was not a pipe dream after all
1365,on the other hand what was considered the “safe” choicehillary clintonturned out to be a very dangerous choice
1366,whose revolution
1367,it’s urgent that we figure out why sanders failed to galvanize significant numbers of progressive intellectuals and important social movements that were far from thrilled with clinton and establishment democrats
1368,some backed sanders tepidly or chose not to back any candidate in the race convinced that no one had earned their vote and that bernie’s “political revolution” didn’t truly include them
1369,though i did endorse bernie i recognize that there were legitimate reasons why many people of color and women made a different choice
1370,though clinton thought her nods to identity politics could substitute for substantial economic change it often appeared as if bernie thought that economics could paper over the unique needs and histories of black people women and other traditionally marginalized groups
1371,yes he faced unfair smears in this regard
1372,but the more important lesson is that without bernie’s weaknesses on race and gender he could have won no matter how hard the democratic party establishment tried to hold him back
1373,he would have won if he had persuaded more middleaged and older women that he understood how important and precarious reproductive rights still are and that he fully grasped the urgency of the epidemic of violence against women
1374,in key states such as pennsylvania and new york he could have won if he had been able to win the support of just half of black voters
1375,but to do that he would have needed to clearly and compellingly connect the dots between the country’s deepest economic inequalities and the persistent legacy of slavery jim crow laws and housing and financial discrimination
1376,tanehisi coates writing in the atlantic  pointed out that when it came to confronting that legacy the boldness and radicalism sanders displayed when taking on wall street suddenly petered out
1377,asked whether he supported some form of reparations for slavery he dismissed the idea as politically impractical and unnecessarily “divisive” saying that big investments in communities of color would have the same effect
1378,but as coates rightly pointed out the whole point of sanders’s candidacy was to push the envelope of what is considered politically possibleso where was that same boldness when it came to racial equality
1379,“the spectacle of a socialist candidate opposing reparations as ‘divisive’ there are few political labels more divisive in the minds of americans than socialist is only rivalled by the implausibility of sanders posing as a pragmatist” coates wrote
1380,despite his strong critique coates publicly said he would be voting for sanders in the primary as “the best option that we have in the race” michelle alexander author of the new jim crow  came out strongly against clinton during the primaries arguing that her track record on criminal justice and welfare meant she did not deserve the black vote
1381,but she also chose not to publicly endorse sanders
1382,the most urgent message of the 2016 election she told me is “if progressives think they can win in the long run without engaging meaningfully with black folks and taking racial history more seriously they better get elon musk on speed dial and start planning their future home on mars because this planet will be going up in smoke” it’s a message we need to learn fast
1383,because if left populist candidates keep missing the mark and democrats keep putting up establishment candidates in their place there is every reason to expect an increasingly belligerent right to keep on winning
1384,a toxic cocktail around the world trump thundered all is hell
1385,and clinton answered all is wellwe just need a few minor tweaks here and there to make it more inclusive
1386,“love trumps hate” was clinton’s final slogan
1387,but love alone wasn’t up to the job it needed something stronger to help it out something like justice
1388,as a candidate hillary clinton was in no position to speak to the mounting popular rage that defines our times
1389,she had helped negotiate trade deals like the tpp that so many see as a threat the first clinton administration had deregulated the banks and derivatives market laying the groundwork for the financial crash she never came out against the move and had taken notinsignificant speaking fees from those banks herself
1390,so she tried to paper over the popular distresswith the results we know
1391,in the absence of a progressive alternative trump had a free hand to connect with skeptical voters by saying i feel your pain
1392,you have been screwed
1393,on the campaign trail he directed some of the rage at the corporations who had pushed for these policiesbut that’s mostly forgotten now
1394,most of his wrath was saved for the various racist bogeymen he conjured up the immigrants coming to rape you the muslims coming to blow you up the black activists who don’t respect our men in uniform and the black president who messed everything up
1395,the brexit campaign spoke to that same toxic cocktail of real economic pain and genuinely eroded democracy combined with identitybased entitlement
1396,and just as hillary clinton had no compelling answer to trump’s fake economic populism the remain campaign had no answer to nigel farage and ukip  when they said that people’s lives were out of control and public services were underfunded even as their proposed solution was poised to make things even worse
1397,the crucial lesson of brexit and of trump’s victory is that leaders who are seen as representing the failed neoliberal status quo are no match for the demagogues and neofascists
1398,only a bold and genuinely redistributive progressive agenda can offer real answers to inequality and the crises in democracy while directing popular rage where it belongs at those who have benefited so extravagantly from the auctioning off of public wealth the polluting of land air and water and the deregulation of the financial sphere
1399,we need to remember this the next time we’re asked to back a party or candidate in an election
1400,in this destabilized era statusquo politicians often cannot get the job done
1401,on the other hand the choice that may at first seem radical maybe even a little risky may well be the more pragmatic one in this volatile era
1402,and from the perspective of our warming planet it’s worth remembering that radical political and economic change is our only hope of avoiding radical change to our physical world
1403,whatever happens the next few years are going to be rocky
1404,so before we focus on how to win the world we want and need we first have to get ready for the next wave of crises coming from the trump white house shocks that could well reverberate the world over
1405,part iii how it could get worse the shocks to come history is important
1406,if you don’t know history it’s as if you were born yesterday
1407,and if you were born yesterday anybody up there in a position of power can tell you anything and you have no way of checking up on it 
1408,howard zinn you can’t be neutral on a moving train  2004 documentary chapter eight masters of disaster doing an end run around democracy there have been times in my reporting from disaster zones when i have had the unsettling feeling that i was seeing not just a crisis in the here and now but a glimpse of our collective futurea preview of where the road we are all on is headed unless we somehow grab the wheel and swerve
1409,when i listen to trump speak with his obvious relish in creating an atmosphere of chaos and destabilization i often think i’ve seen this before i’ve seen it in those strange moments when portals seemed to open up into our collective future
1410,one of those moments arrived in new orleans after hurricane katrina as i watched hordes of private military contractors descend on the flooded city to find ways to profit from the disaster even as thousands of the city’s residents abandoned by their government were treated like dangerous criminals just for trying to survive
1411,i watched another such dystopian window open in 2003 in baghdad shortly after the invasion
1412,at that time the us occupation had carved the city in two
1413,at its heart behind enormous concrete walls and bomb detectors there was the green zonea little chunk of the united states rebuilt in iraq with bars serving hard liquor fast food joints gyms and a pool where there seemed to be a party 247
1414,and thenbeyond those wallsthere was a city bombed to rubble where there was often no electricity for hospitals and where violence between iraqi factions and us occupation forces was spiraling out of control
1415,that was the red zone
1416,the green zone at the time was the fiefdom of paul bremer former assistant to henry kissinger and director of kissinger’s consulting firm whom george w bush had named as the chief us envoy to iraq
1417,since there was no functioning national government that essentially made him iraq’s supreme leader
1418,bremer’s was an entirely privatized empire
1419,dressed in combat boots and a sharp business suit bremer was always protected by a phalanx of blackclad mercenaries working for the nowdefunct company blackwater and the green zone itself was run by halliburtonone of the largest oil field companies in the world previously headed by then vice president dick cheneyalong with a network of other private contractors
1420,when us officials made forays outside the green zone or the “emerald city” as some journalists called it they did so in heavily armored convoys with soldiers and mercenaries pointing machine guns outward in all directions guided by an ethic of “shoot first ask questions later” regular iraqis supposedly being liberated by all this weaponry had no protection except for the kind provided by religious militias in exchange for loyalty
1421,the message broadcast by the convoys was loud and clear some lives count a hell of a lot more than others
1422,from deep inside his green zone fortress bremer issued decree after decree about how iraq should be remade into a model free market economy
1423,come to think of it it was a lot like donald trump’s white house
1424,and the edicts were pretty similar too
1425,bremer ordered for instance that iraq should have a 15 percent flat tax quite similar to what trump has proposed that its stateowned assets should be rapidly auctioned off under consideration by trump and that government should be dramatically downsized trump again
1426,the pace was frantic
1427,bremer with an eye on the fossil fuel fields of iraq and beyond was determined to get his country makeover done before iraqis went to the polls and had any kind of say in what their “liberated” future would look like
1428,in one particularly surreal chapter bremer and the state department brought in advisers from russia who had led that country’s disastrous experiment with “economic shock therapy” the corruptionladen deregulation and privatization frenzy which produced that country’s notorious class of oligarchs
1429,inside the green zone the visitorsincluding yegor gaidar known as russia’s “dr
1430,shock”lectured the usappointed iraqi politicians about how important it was to radically remake the economy all at once and without hesitating before iraq’s population recovered from the war
1431,iraqis would never have accepted these policies if they’d had a say and they did in fact reject many of them later
1432,it was only the extreme crisis that made bremer’s plan conceivable
1433,in fact bremer’s open determination to auction off iraq’s state owned assets under cover of crisis did a lot to confirm the widespread perception that the invasion was more about liberating iraq’s wealth for foreign companies than about liberating its people from despotism
1434,the country spiraled into violence
1435,the us military and its private contractors responded with more violence more shocks
1436,unfathomable sums of money disappeared into the black hole of the contractor economymoney that came to be known as “iraq’s missing billions” it wasn’t just the seamless merger of corporate power and open warfare that felt like a glimpse into the dystopian future imagined so many times in science fiction and hollywood films
1437,it was also the clear mechanism of using crisis to ram through policies that would never have been feasible in normal times
1438,it was in iraq that i developed the thesis for the shock doctrine 
1439,originally the book was going to focus exclusively on bush’s war but then i started to notice the same tactics and the same contractors such as halliburton blackwater bechtel in disaster zones around the world
1440,first came an intense crisisnatural disaster terrorist attackthen came the blitzkrieg of procorporate policies
1441,often the strategy of crisis exploitation was discussed right out in the openno dark conspiracy theories required
1442,as i delved deeper i realized that this strategy had been a silent partner to the imposition of neoliberalism for more than forty years
1443,that “shock tactics” follow a clear pattern wait for a crisis or even in some instances as in chile or russia help foment one declare a moment of what is sometimes called “extraordinary politics” suspend some or all democratic normsand then ram the corporate wish list through as quickly as possible
1444,the research showed that virtually any tumultuous situation if framed with sufficient hysteria by political leaders could serve this softeningup function
1445,it could be an event as radical as a military coup but the economic shock of a market or budget crisis would also do the trick
1446,in the midst of hyperinflation or a banking collapse for instance the country’s governing elites were frequently able to sell a panicked population on the necessity for attacks on social protections or enormous bailouts to prop up the financial private sectorbecause the alternative they claimed was outright economic apocalypse
1447,the shock doctor’s handbook shock tactics were first deployed in the service of neoliberalism in the early 1970s in latin america and they are still being used today to extract “freemarket” concessions against the popular will
1448,we’ve seen it happen recently before trump in us cities including detroit and flint where looming municipal bankruptcy became the pretext for dissolving local democracy and appointing “emergency managers” it is unfolding in puerto rico where the ongoing debt crisis has been used to install the unaccountable “financial oversight and management board” an enforcement mechanism for harsh austerity measures including cuts to pensions and waves of school closures
1449,it is being deployed in brazil where the highly questionable impeachment of president dilma rousseff in 2016 was followed by the installation of an unelected zealously probusiness regime that has frozen public spending for the next twenty years imposed punishing austerity and begun selling off airports power stations and other public assets in a frenzy of privatization
1450,and it is happening in blatant form under the presidency of donald trump
1451,on the campaign trail he did not tell his adoring crowds that he would cut funds for mealsonwheels a vital source of nutrition for the elderly and disabled or admit that he was going to try to take health insurance away from millions of americans
1452,he said the very opposite as on so many other issues
1453,since taking office he’s never allowed the atmosphere of chaos and crisis to let up
1454,the outrages come so fast and furious that many are understandably struggling to find their footing
1455,experiencing trump’s tsunami of oval office decreesseven executive orders in his first eleven full days plus eleven presidential memoranda issued in that same periodhas felt a little like standing in front of one of those tennis ball machines
1456,opponents might swat back a ball or two but we’re all still getting hit in the face over and over again
1457,even the widespread belief among many or is it hope
1458,that trump will not last his full term contributes to the collective vertigo nothing about the current situation is stable or static which is a very difficult position from which to strategize or organize
1459,democracy suspended until further notice the last half century shows how deliberatelyand effectivelythe shock doctrine strategy has been deployed by governments to overcome democratic resistance to profoundly damaging policies
1460,and some kind of democracyavoidance strategy is needed because many neoliberal policies are so unpopular that people reliably reject them both at the polls and in the streets
1461,with good reason as the tremendous hoarding and hiding of vast sums of wealth by a small and unaccountable global class of virtual oligarchs makes clear those who benefit most from these radical social restructurings are a small minority while the majority see their standard of living stagnate or slip even in periods of rapid economic growth
1462,which is why for those who are determined to push through these policies majority rule and democratic freedoms aren’t a friendthey are a hindrance and a threat
1463,not every neoliberal policy is unpopular of course
1464,people do like tax cuts for the middle class and working poor if not for the super rich as well as the idea of cutting “red tape” at least in theory
1465,but they also on the whole like their taxes to pay for statefunded health care clean water good public schools safe workplaces pensions and other programs to care for the elderly and disadvantaged
1466,politicians planning to slash these kinds of essential protections and services or to privatize them are rightly wary of putting those plans at the center of their electoral platforms
1467,far more common is for neoliberal politicians to campaign on promises of cutting taxes and government waste while protecting essential services and then under cover of some sort of crisis real or exaggerated claim with apparent reluctance and wringing of hands that sorry we have no choice but to go after your health care
1468,doing it fast and all at once the bottom line is that hardcore free marketers or “libertarians” as the billionaire koch brothers describe themselves are attracted to moments of cataclysm because nonapocalyptic reality is actually inhospitable to their antidemocratic ambitions
1469,speed is of the essence in all this since periods of shock are temporary by nature
1470,like bremer shockdrunk leaders and their funders usually try to follow machiavelli’s advice in the prince “for injuries ought to be done all at one time so that being tasted less they offend less” the logic is straightforward enough people can develop responses to sequential or gradual change
1471,but if dozens of changes come from all directions at once the hope is that populations will rapidly become exhausted and overwhelmed and will ultimately swallow their bitter medicine
1472,recall the description of poland’s shock therapy as unfolding in “dog years” the shock doctrine was controversial when it came out in 2007 i was challenging a rosy version of history that many of us have grown up withthe version which tells us that deregulated markets and democracy advanced together hand in hand over the second half of the twentieth century
1473,the truth it turns out is much uglier
1474,the extreme form of capitalism that has been remaking our world in this periodwhich nobel prize–winning economist joseph stiglitz has termed “market fundamentalism”very often could advance only in contexts where democracy was suspended and people’s freedoms were sharply curtailed
1475,in some cases ferocious violence including torture was used to keep rebellious populations under control
1476,the late economist milton friedman called his most famous book capitalism and freedom  presenting human liberation and market liberation as flip sides of the same coin
1477,and yet the first country to put friedman’s ideas into practice in unadulterated form was not a democracyit was chile in the immediate aftermath of the cia supported coup that overthrew a democratically elected socialist president salvador allende and installed a farright dictator general augusto pinochet
1478,this was not an accidentthe ideas were just too unpopular to be introduced without the help of a strongarm despot
1479,richard nixon had famously growled after allende won the 1970 elections “make the economy scream” with allende left dead in the bloody coup friedman advised pinochet that he should not blink when it came to economic transformation prescribing what he termed the “shock treatment” approach
1480,under the advice of the famed economist and his former students known in latin america as “the chicago boys” chile replaced its public school system with vouchers and charter schools made health care payasyougo and privatized kindergartens and cemeteries and did many other things us republicans have been eyeing for decades
1481,and recall this was in a country whose people were distinctly hostile to exactly these policiesa country which had before the coup democratically chosen socialist policies
1482,similar regimes were installed in several latin american countries during this period
1483,leading intellectuals in the region drew a direct connection between the economic shock treatments that impoverished millions and the epidemic of torture that ravaged hundreds of thousands in chile argentina uruguay and brazil who believed in a fairer society
1484,as the late uruguayan historian eduardo galeano asked “how can this inequality be maintained if not through jolts of electric shock” latin america received a particularly strong dose of these twin forms of shock
1485,most “freemarket” makeovers were not so bloody
1486,radical political transitions such as the collapse of the soviet union or the end of south african apartheid have also provided disorienting cover for neoliberal economic transformations
1487,the most frequent midwife by far has been largescale economic crisis which time and again has been harnessed to demand radical campaigns of privatization deregulation and cuts to safety nets
1488,but in truth any shock can do the trickincluding natural disasters that require large scale reconstruction and therefore provide an opening to transfer land and resources from the vulnerable to the powerful
1489,the opposite of decency most people are appalled by this kind of crisis exploitation and with good reason
1490,the shock doctrine is the polar opposite of the way decent people left to their own devices tend to respond when they see widespread trauma which is to offer help
1491,think of the staggering 3 billion privately donated in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in haiti or the millions offered in response to the 2015 quake in nepal or the 2004 asian tsunami
1492,these disasters like so many others provoked extraordinary gestures of generosity from individuals around the world
1493,thousands upon thousands of regular people donated money and volunteered their labor
1494,as the american historian and writer rebecca solnit has so eloquently described disasters have a way of bringing out the best in us
1495,it is in such moments that we often see some of the most moving displays of mutual aid and solidarity
1496,in sri lanka after the 2004 tsunami despite decades of interethnic civil war muslims saved their hindu neighbors and hindus saved their buddhist neighbors
1497,in flooded postkatrina new orleans people put their own lives at great risk to rescue and care for their neighbors
1498,after superstorm sandy hit new york a remarkable network of volunteers fanned out across the city under the banner of occupy sandyit grew out of the occupy wall street movementto serve hundreds of thousands of meals help clear out more than a thousand homes and provide clothing blankets and medical care to thousands of people in need
1499,the shock doctrine is about overriding these deeply human impulses to help seeking instead to capitalize on the vulnerability of others in order to maximize wealth and advantage for a select few
1500,there are few things more sinister than that
1501,the art of the steal shock doctrine logic is entirely in keeping with trump’s view of the world
1502,he unabashedly sees life as a battle for dominance over others and he keeps obsessive track of who is winning
1503,in his muchself celebrated negotiations the questions are always the same what’s the most that i can get out of this deal
1504,how do i exploit my adversary’s weakness
1505,in a particularly candid moment on fox  friends in 2011 he described a deal he made with former libyan leader muammar qaddafi like this “i rented him a piece of land
1506,he paid me more for one night than the land was worth for the whole year or for two years and then i didn’t let him use the land
1507,that’s what we should be doing
1508,i don’t want to use the word screwed  but i screwed him
1509,that’s what we should be doing” if trump extracted predatory terms only from despised dictators few tears would be shed
1510,but this is trump’s attitude to all negotiations
1511,in think big  one of his howtobelikeme manuals he describes his negotiation philosophy this way “you hear lots of people say that a great deal is when both sides win
1512,that is a bunch of crap
1513,in a great deal you winnot the other side
1514,you crush the opponent and come away with something better for yourself” this coldblooded enthusiasm for exploiting the weakness of others has shaped trump’s career as a real estate developer and it is a trait he shares with many members of his administration
1515,it’s worrying for what it tells us about not only the atmosphere of chaos his team appears to be consciously cultivating but also far more alarmingly how they might exploit any larger crises yet to come
1516,so far trump’s unending atmosphere of crisis has been sustained largely through his own overthetop rhetoricdeclaring cities “crime infested” sites of “carnage” when in fact the violentcrime rate has been declining nationwide for decades hammering away at a manufactured narrative about an immigrant crime wave and generally insisting that obama destroyed the country
1517,soon enough however trump could well have some crises to exploit that are distinctly more real since crisis is the logical conclusion of his policies on every front
1518,given this it’s well worth taking a close look at the ways in which trump and his team have exploited moments of crisis in the past to achieve their economic and political goals
1519,understanding this track record will make whatever happens next a whole lot less shocking and will ultimately help us to resist these tired tactics
1520,a career forged in shock in the united states the neoliberal revolution got a head start in new york city in the mid1970s
1521,up until this point the city had been a bold if imperfect experiment in social democracy featuring the most generous public services in the united states from libraries to mass transit to hospitals
1522,but in 1975 federal and state cutbacks combined with a national recession pushed new york to the brink of allout bankruptcy and the crisis was seized upon to dramatically remake the city
1523,under cover of crisis came a wave of brutal austerity sweetheart deals to the rich and privatizationswith the end result of turning the city so many of us love into the temple of speculative finance luxury consumption and nonstop gentrification that we know today
1524,in fear city  a recently published book about this littleunderstood chapter in america’s past historian kim phillipsfein meticulously documents how the remaking of new york city in the seventies was a prelude to what would become a global tidal wave one that has left the world sharply divided between the one percent and the restand nowhere more so than in the city donald trump calls home
1525,it’s also a story in which trump plays a starring if unflattering role
1526,in 1975 with no help forthcoming from president gerald ford it looked so likely that the united states’ largest and most storied city would actually go bankrupt that the new york daily news ran a banner headline that said simply ford to city drop dead 
1527,at the time trump was just twentynine years old and still working in the shadow of his wealthy father who had made his fortune building distinctly unflashy middleclass homes in new york’s outer boroughsand who was notorious as a landlord practicing systemic discrimination against african americans
1528,trump had always dreamed of making his mark in manhattan and with the debt crisis he saw his big chance
1529,the opening came in 1976 when the famed commodore hotel a historic midtown landmark announced that it was losing so much money that it might have to close down
1530,the city government was panicked at the prospect of this iconic building sitting empty broadcasting a message of urban decay and depriving the city of tax revenue
1531,they needed a buyer quick and the mood was sufficiently desperate that as one local television broadcast put it “beggars can’t be choosers” enter trump proto–disaster capitalist
1532,partnering with the hyatt corporation trump had a plan to replace the commodore’s classic brick facade with “a new skin” of reflective glass and to reopen it as the grand hyatt hotel this was in the brief window before the future us president began insisting that all his developments bear his name
1533,he extracted extraordinary terms from a city in crisis
1534,as phillipsfein explains trump would be allowed to purchase the property from the railroad for 95 million
1535,then he would sell it for a dollar to the urban development corporationfinally the udc would lease the property back to trump and the hyatt corporation for ninetynine years allowing the developers to pay taxes far below the normal rate for four decadesa windfall worth hundreds of millions of dollars
1536,as of 2016 trump’s tax break has cost new york city 360 million in uncollected taxes
1537,yes that’s right for 95 million down trump extracted a taxbreak windfall for the property worth 360 million and counting from the city
1538,the new hotel was a blightwhat one architectural critic described as “an outoftowner’s vision of city life” in other words it was vintage trump a man who would go on to sell the world on a russian oligarch’s vision of the united states as filtered through bootleg vhs copies of the eighties soap operas dynasty and dallas 
1539,in phillipsfein’s words donald trump and the developers who exploited the city’s desperation to build their towers had little interest in the rest of new york
1540,the fact that millions of dollars went to subsidize building projects instead of restoring public services or promoting recovery in the poor and working class neighborhoods of the city never registered as a moral concern
1541,what is striking about this story is not simply that a young trump seized on new york’s economic catastrophe to boost his own fortune extracting predatory terms from a government in crisis
1542,it’s also that this was not just any dealit was the one that let trump emerge from his father’s shadow and decisively turned him into a player in his own right
1543,trump’s career was forged in shock shaped by the unique opportunities for profit presented by moments of crisis
1544,right from his breakout moment his attitude toward the public sphere was that it was there to be pillaged to enrich himself
1545,it’s an attitude that has stayed with him ever since
1546,it’s worth remembering that on september 11 2001 shortly after the twin towers came down trump gave an interview to a radio station during which he could not help observing that with the towers gone he now had the tallest building in downtown manhattan
1547,dead bodies were in the street lower manhattan looked like a war zone and yet with only a little encouragement from the radio hosts trump was thinking about his brand advantage
1548,when i asked phillipsfein what lessons she drew from studying trump’s actions during new york’s debt crisis her reply was all about fear
1549,there was she said “this deep level of fear about bankruptcy fear of the future
1550,and it’s that kind of fear that really makes possible the cutbacks of the time and also the sense that the city needs a savior in the first place” since the 2016 election she has been thinking about this a lot
1551,“the way that fear can make things that seem politically impossible suddenly feel as though they’re the only alternative
1552,and so i think that is one of the things that we need to fight at this moment and to find ways to resist that sense of overwhelming fear and chaos and to find forms of solidarity that can counter it” it’s good advice
1553,especially since trump has assembled around him an allstar cast of crisis opportunists
1554,meet the disaster capitalism cabinet senior members of trump’s team have been at the heart of some of the most egregious examples of the shock doctrine in recent memory
1555,what follows is a brief overview of their exploits which by nature of just how many goldman sachs executives trump has appointed is by no means exhaustive
1556,profiting from climate change and war rex tillerson us secretary of state has built his career in large part around taking advantage of the profitability of war and instability
1557,exxonmobil profited more than any oil major from the increase in the price of oil that was the result of the 2003 invasion of iraq
1558,it also directly exploited the iraq war to defy state department advice and make an exploration deal in iraqi kurdistan a move that because it sidelined iraq’s central government could well have sparked a full blown civil war and certainly did contribute to internal conflict
1559,as ceo of exxonmobil tillerson profited from disaster in other ways as well
1560,as we have already seen as an executive at the fossil fuel giant he spent his career working for a company that despite its own scientists’ research into the reality of humancaused climate change decided to fund and spread misinformation and junk climate science
1561,all the while according to an la times investigation exxonmobil both before and after those two companies merged worked diligently to figure out how to further profit from and protect itself against the very crisis on which it was casting doubt
1562,it did so by exploring drilling in the arctic which was melting thanks to climate change redesigning a natural gas pipeline in the north sea to accommodate rising sea levels and supercharged storms and doing the same for a new rig off the coast of nova scotia
1563,at a public event in 2012 tillerson acknowledged that climate change was happeningbut what he said next was revealing “as a species” humans have always adapted
1564,“so we will adapt to this
1565,changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around we’ll adapt to that” he’s quite right humans do adapt when their land ceases to produce food
1566,the way humans adapt is by moving
1567,they leave their homes and look for places to live where they can feed themselves and their families
1568,but as tillerson well knows we do not live at a time when countries gladly open their borders to hungry and desperate people
1569,in fact he now works for a president who has painted refugees from syriaa country where drought was an accelerant of the tensions that led to civil waras trojan horses for terrorism
1570,a president who introduced a travel ban that if it had not been blocked by the courts would have barred syrian migrants from entering the united states
1571,a president who has said about syrian children seeking asylum “i can look in their faces and say ‘you can’t come’ ” a president who has not budged from that position even after he ordered missile strikes on syria supposedly moved by the horrifying impacts of a chemical weapon attack on syrian children and “beautiful babies” but not moved enough to welcome them and their parents
1572,a president who has announced plans to turn the tracking surveillance incarceration and deportation of immigrants into a defining feature of his administration
1573,waiting in the wings biding their time are plenty of other members of the trump team who have deep skills in profiting from all of that
1574,profiting from prisons between election day and the end of trump’s first month in office the stocks of the two largest private prison companies in the usa corecivic formerly the corrections corporation of america and the geo group doubled soaring by 140 percent and 98 percent respectively
1575,and why not
1576,just as exxon learned to profit from climate change these companies are part of the sprawling industry of private prisons private security and private surveillance that sees wars and migration both very often linked to climate stressesas exciting and expanding market opportunities
1577,in the united states the immigration and customs enforcement agency ice incarcerates up to thirtyfour thousand immigrants thought to be in the country illegally on any given day and 73 percent of them are held in private prisons
1578,little wonder then that these companies’ stocks soared on trump’s election
1579,and soon they had even more reasons to celebrate one of the first things jeff sessions did as trump’s attorney general was rescind the obama administration’s decision to move away from forprofit jails for the general prison population
1580,profiting from war and surveillance trump appointed as deputy defense secretary patrick shanahan a top executive at boeing who at one point was responsible for selling costly hardware to the us military including apache and chinook helicopters
1581,he also oversaw boeing’s ballistic missile defense program a part of the operation that stands to profit enormously if international tensions continue to escalate under trump
1582,and this is part of a much larger trend
1583,as lee fang reported in the intercept in march 2017 “president donald trump has weaponized the revolving door by appointing defense contractors and lobbyists to key government positions as he seeks to rapidly expand the military budget and homeland security programsat least 15 officials with financial ties to defense contractors have been either nominated or appointed so far” the revolving door is nothing new of course
1584,retired military brass reliably take up jobs and contracts with weapons companies
1585,what’s new is the number of generals with lucrative ties to military contractors whom trump has appointed to cabinet posts with the power to allocate fundsincluding those stemming from his plan to increase spending on the military the pentagon and the department of homeland security by more than 80 billion in just one year
1586,the other thing that has changed is the size of the homeland security and surveillance industry
1587,this sector grew exponentially after the september 11 attacks when the bush administration announced it was embarking on a neverending “war on terror” and that everything that could be outsourced would be
1588,new firms with tinted windows sprouted up like malevolent mushrooms around suburban virginia outside washington dc and existing ones like booz allen hamilton expanded into brandnew territories
1589,writing in slate in 2005 daniel gross captured the mood of what many called the security bubble “homeland security may have just reached the stage that internet investing hit in 1997 back then all you needed to do was put an ‘e’ in front of your company name and your ipo would rocket
1590,now you can do the same with ‘fortress’ ” that means many of trump’s appointees come from firms that specialize in functions which not so long ago it would have been unthinkable to outsource
1591,his national security council chief of staff for instance is retired lieutenant general keith kellogg
1592,among the many jobs kellogg has had with security contractors since going private was one with cubic defense
1593,according to the company he led “our ground combat training business and focus on expanding the company’s worldwide customer base” if you think “combat training” is something armies used to do all on their own you’d be right
1594,one noticeable thing about trump’s contractor appointees is how many of them come from firms that did not even exist before 911 l1 identity solutions specializing in biometrics the chertoff group founded by bush’s homeland security director michael chertoff palantir technologies a surveillancebig data firm cofounded by paypal billionaire and trump backer peter thiel and many more
1595,security firms draw heavily on the military and intelligence wings of government for their staffing
1596,under trump a remarkable number of lobbyists and staffers from these firms are now migrating back to government where they will very likely push for even more opportunities to monetize the hunt for people president trump likes to call “bad hombres” this creates a disastrous cocktail
1597,take a group of people who directly profit from ongoing war and then put those same people at the heart of government
1598,who’s going to make the case for peace
1599,indeed the idea that a war could ever definitively end seems a quaint relic of what during the bush years was dismissed as “pre–september 11 thinking” profiting from economic crisis ties between the us government and the business world date back to 1776 several of the founding fathers were from wealthy plantation owning families
1600,the revolving door has been spinning ever since regardless of whether a democrat or a republican was in the oval office
1601,the difference with trump as is so often the case is one of volume and shamelessness
1602,as of this writing donald trump has appointed five current or former goldman sachs executives to senior roles in his administration including steve mnuchin as treasury secretary james donovan formerly a goldman sachs managing director as deputy treasury secretary gary cohn formerly goldman’s chief operating officer as director of the white house national economic council and dina powell formerly goldman’s head of impact investing as the white house senior counselor for economic initiatives
1603,even steve bannon once worked at goldman
1604,and that’s not counting trump’s pick to lead the securities and exchange commission jay clayton who served as goldman’s lawyer on multibilliondollar deals and whose wife is a wealth manager with the company
1605,making all these goldman appointments is particularly brazen given trump’s invocation of the bank to attack his opponents
1606,in a typically vicious salvo at his gop rival ted cruz he claimed the goldman guys “have total total control over him
1607,just like they have total control over hillary clinton” it’s also extremely worrying for what it says about the administration’s willingness to exploit the economic shocks that may well reverberate on their watch
1608,of all the major wall street investment banks at the center of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis goldman sachs was among the most predatory
1609,not only did goldman do a huge amount to help inflate the mortgage bubble with complex financial instruments but it then turned around and mid crisis allegedly bet against the mortgage market and earned billions
1610,in 2016 the bank was ordered by the united states justice department to pay a settlement of 5 billionthe largest settlement goldman had ever paidfor these and other malpractices
1611,in 2010 it agreed to a further 550million fine the largest ever paid by a wall street firm in the then 76year history of the securities and exchange commission for its role in the financial crisis
1612,democratic senator carl levin who headed the 2010 senate subcommittee that investigated goldman sachs following the financial crisis summarized their misdeeds the evidence shows that goldman repeatedly put its own interests and profits ahead of the interests of its clients and our communities
1613,goldman sachs didn’t just make money
1614,it profited by taking advantage of its clients’ reasonable expectation that it would not sell products that it didn’t want to succeed and that there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and the customers it had pledged to serve
1615,goldman’s actions demonstrate that it often saw its clients not as valuable customers but as objects for its own profit
1616,this matters because instead of doing well when its clients did well goldman sachs did well when its clients lost money
1617,even among goldman alumni steven mnuchin has distinguished himself by his willingness to profit off misery
1618,after the 2008 wall street collapse and in the midst of the foreclosure crisis mnuchin purchased a california bank
1619,the renamed company onewest earned mnuchin the nickname “foreclosure king” reportedly collecting 12 billion from the government to help cover the losses for foreclosed homes and evicting tens of thousands of people between 2009 and 2014 one attempted foreclosure involved a ninetyyearold woman who was behind on her payments by 27 cents
1620,these predatory practices drew fire during mnuchin’s confirmation hearing for treasury secretary though not enough for republicans to vote against him
1621,oregon democratic senator ron wyden said during the hearing that “while mr mnuchin was ceo the bank proved it could put more vulnerable people on the streets faster than just about anybody” and charged “onewest churned out foreclosures like chinese factories churned out trump suits and ties” profiting from natural disasters and then there’s vice president mike pence seen by many as the grownup in trump’s messy room
1622,yet it is pence the former governor of indiana who actually has the most disturbing track record when it comes to bloodyminded exploitation of human suffering
1623,when mike pence was announced as donald trump’s running mate i thought to myself “i know that name
1624,i’ve seen it somewhere” and then i remembered
1625,he was at the heart of one of the most shocking stories i’ve ever covered the disaster capitalism freeforall that followed katrina and the drowning of new orleans
1626,mike pence’s doings as a profiteer from human suffering are so appalling that they are worth exploring in a little more depth since they tell us a great deal about what we can expect from this administration during times of heightened crisis
1627,the katrina blueprint before we delve into pence’s role what’s important to remember about hurricane katrina is that though it is usually described as a “natural disaster” there was nothing natural about the way it impacted the city of new orleans
1628,when katrina hit the coast of mississippi in august 2005 it had been downgraded from a category 5 to a stilldevastating category 3 hurricane
1629,but by the time it made its way to new orleans it had lost most of its strength and been downgraded again to a “tropical storm” that’s relevant because a tropical storm should never have broken through new orleans’s flood defense
1630,katrina did break through however because the levees that protect the city did not hold
1631,why
1632,we now know that despite repeated warnings about the risk the army corps of engineers had allowed the levees to fall into a state of disrepair
1633,that failure was the result of two main factors
1634,one was a specific disregard for the lives of poor black people whose homes in the lower ninth ward were left most vulnerable by the failure to fix the levees
1635,this was part of a wider neglect of public infrastructure across the united states which is the direct result of decades of neoliberal policy
1636,because when you systematically wage war on the very idea of the public sphere and the public good of course the publicly owned bones of societyroads bridges levees water systemsare going to slip into a state of such disrepair that it takes little to push them beyond the breaking point
1637,when you massively cut taxes so that you don’t have money to spend on much of anything besides the police and the military this is what happens
1638,it wasn’t just the physical infrastructure that failed the city and particularly its poorest residents who are as in so many us cities overwhelmingly african american
1639,the human systems of disaster response also failed the second great fracturing
1640,the arm of the federal government that is tasked with responding to moments of national crisis like this is the federal emergency management agency with state and municipal governments also playing key roles in evacuation planning and response
1641,all levels of government failed
1642,it took fema five days to get water and food to people in new orleans who had sought emergency shelter in the superdome
1643,the most harrowing images from that time were of people stranded on rooftopsof homes and hospitalsholding up signs that said help  watching the helicopters pass them by
1644,people helped each other as best they could
1645,they rescued each other in canoes and rowboats
1646,they fed each other
1647,they displayed that beautiful human capacity for solidarity that moments of crisis so often intensify
1648,but at the official level it was the complete opposite
1649,i’ll always remember the words of curtis muhammad a longtime new orleans civil rights organizer who said this experience “convinced us that we had no caretakers” the way this abandonment played out was deeply unequal and the divisions cleaved along lines of race and class
1650,many people were able to leave the city on their ownthey got into their cars drove to a dry hotel called their insurance brokers
1651,some people stayed because they believed the storm defenses would hold
1652,but a great many others stayed because they had no choicethey didn’t have a car or were too infirm to drive or simply didn’t know what to do
1653,those are the people who needed a functioning system of evacuation and reliefand they were out of luck
1654,it felt like baghdad all over again with some people taking shelter in their own private green zones while many more were left stranded in the red zonewhere the worst was yet to come
1655,abandoned in the city without food or water those in need did what anyone would do in those circumstances they took provisions from local stores
1656,fox news and other media outlets seized on this to paint new orleans’s black residents as dangerous “looters” who would soon be coming to invade the dry white parts of the city and surrounding suburbs and towns
1657,buildings were spraypainted with messages “looters will be shot” checkpoints were set up to trap people in the flooded parts of town
1658,on danziger bridge police officers shot black residents on sight five of the officers involved ultimately pled guilty and the city came to a 133million settlement with the families in that case and two other similar postkatrina cases
1659,meanwhile gangs of armed white vigilantes prowled the streets looking as one resident later put it in an exposé by investigative journalist ac thompson for “the opportunity to hunt black people” in the red zone apparently anything goes
1660,i was in new orleans and i saw for myself how amped up the police and military werenot to mention private security guards from companies like blackwater who were showing up fresh from iraq
1661,it felt very much like a war zone with poor and black people in the crosshairspeople whose only crime was trying to survive
1662,by the time the national guard arrived to organize a full evacuation of the city it was done with a level of aggression and ruthlessness that was hard to fathom
1663,soldiers pointed machine guns at residents as they boarded buses providing no information about where they were being taken
1664,children were often separated from their parents
1665,what i saw during the flooding shocked me
1666,but what i saw in the aftermath of katrina shocked me even more
1667,with the city reeling and with its residents dispersed across the country and unable to protect their own interests a plan emerged to ram through a procorporate wish list with maximum velocity
1668,milton friedman then ninetythree years old wrote an article for the wall street journal stating “most new orleans schools are in ruins as are the homes of the children who have attended them
1669,the children are now scattered all over the country
1670,this is a tragedy
1671,it is also an opportunity to radically reform the educational system” in a similar vein richard baker at that time a republican congressman from louisiana declared “we finally cleaned up public housing in new orleans
1672,we couldn’t do it but god did” i was in an evacuation shelter near baton rouge when baker made that statement
1673,the people i spoke with were just floored by it
1674,imagine being forced to leave your home having to sleep in a cot in some cavernous convention center and then finding out that the people who are supposed to represent you are claiming this was some sort of divine interventiongod apparently really likes condo developments
1675,baker got his “cleanup” of public housing
1676,in the months after the storm with new orleans’s residentsand all their inconvenient opinions rich culture and deep attachmentsout of the way thousands of public housing units many of which had sustained minimal storm damage because they were on high ground were demolished
1677,they were replaced with condos and townhomes priced far out of reach for most who had lived there
1678,and this is where mike pence enters the story
1679,at the time katrina hit new orleans pence was chairman of the powerful and highly ideological republican study committee rsc a caucus of conservative lawmakers
1680,on september 13 2005just fourteen days after the levees were breached and with parts of new orleans still under waterthe rsc convened a fateful meeting at the offices of the heritage foundation in washington dc
1681,under pence’s leadership the group came up with a list of “profreemarket ideas for responding to hurricane katrina and high gas prices”thirtytwo pseudo relief policies in all each one straight out of the disaster capitalism playbook
1682,what stands out is the commitment to wage allout war on labor standards and the public spherewhich is bitterly ironic because the failure of public infrastructure is what turned katrina into a human catastrophe in the first place
1683,also notable is the determination to use any opportunity to strengthen the hand of the oil and gas industry
1684,the list includes recommendations to “automatically suspend davis– bacon prevailing wage laws in disaster areas” a reference to the law that requires federal contractors to pay a living wage “make the entire affected area a flattax freeenterprise zone” and “repeal or waive restrictive environmental regulationsthat hamper rebuilding” president bush adopted many of the recommendations within the week although under pressure he was eventually forced to reinstate the labor standards
1685,another recommendation called for giving parents vouchers to use at private and charter schools forprofit schools subsidized with tax dollars a move perfectly in line with the vision held by trump’s pick for education secretary betsy devos
1686,within the year new orleans became the most privatized school system in the united states
1687,and there was more
1688,though climate scientists have directly linked the increased intensity of hurricanes to warming ocean temperatures that didn’t stop pence and his committee from calling on congress to repeal environmental regulations on the gulf coast give permission for new oil refineries in the united states and greenlight “drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge” it’s a kind of madness
1689,after all these very measures are a surefire way to drive up greenhouse gas emissions the major human contributor to climate change which leads to fiercer storms
1690,yet they were immediately championed by pence and later adopted by bush under the guise of responding to a devastating hurricane
1691,it’s worth pausing to tease out the implications of all of this
1692,hurricane katrina turned into a catastrophe in new orleans because of a combination of extremely heavy weather possibly linked to climate change and weak and neglected public infrastructure
1693,the so called solutions proposed by the group pence headed at the time were the very things that would inevitably exacerbate climate change and weaken public infrastructure even further
1694,he and his fellow “free market” travelers were determined it seems to do the very things that are guaranteed to lead to more katrinas in the future
1695,and now mike pence is in a position to bring this vision to the entire united states
1696,kleptocracy freeforall the oil industry wasn’t the only one to profit from hurricane katrina
1697,immediately after the storm the whole baghdad gang of contractors bechtel fluor halliburton blackwater ch2m hill and parsons infamous for its sloppy iraq workdescended on new orleans
1698,they had a singular vision to prove that the kinds of privatized services they had been providing in iraq and afghanistan also had an ongoing domestic marketand to collect nobid contracts totaling 34 billion in the process
1699,the controversies were legion too many to delve into here
1700,relevant experience often appeared to have nothing to do with how contracts were allocated
1701,take for example the company that fema paid 52 million to perform the crucial role of building a base camp for emergency workers in st bernard parish a suburb of new orleans
1702,the camp construction fell behind schedule and was never completed
1703,under investigation it emerged that the contractor lighthouse disaster relief was in fact a religious group
1704,“about the closest thing i have done to this is just organize a youth camp with my church” confessed lighthouse’s director pastor gary heldreth
1705,after all the layers of subcontractors had taken their cut there was next to nothing left for the people doing the work
1706,author mike davis tracked the way fema paid shaw 175 per square foot to install blue tarps on damaged roofs even though the tarps themselves were provided by the government
1707,once all the subcontractors took their share the workers who actually hammered in the tarps were paid as little as two dollars per square foot
1708,“every level of the contracting food chain in other words is grotesquely overfed except the bottom rung” davis wrote “where the actual work is carried out” these supposed “contractors” were reallylike the trump organization hollow brands sucking out profit and then slapping their name on cheap or nonexistent services
1709,in order to offset the tens of billions going to private companies in contracts and tax breaks in november 2005 the republican controlled congress announced that it needed to cut 40 billion from the federal budget
1710,among the programs that were slashed student loans medicaid and food stamps
1711,so the poorest people in the united states subsidized the contractor bonanza twice first when katrina relief morphed into unregulated corporate handouts providing neither decent jobs nor functional public services and second when the few programs that directly assist the unemployed and working poor nationwide were gutted to pay those bloated bills
1712, new orleans is the disaster capitalism blueprintdesigned by the current vice president and by the heritage foundation the hardright think tank to which trump has outsourced much of his administration’s budgeting
1713,ultimately the response to katrina sparked an approval ratings free fall for george w bush a plunge that eventually lost the republicans the presidency in 2008 nine years later with republicans now in control of congress and the white house it’s not hard to imagine this test case for privatized disaster response being adopted on a national scale
1714,the presence of highly militarized police and armed private soldiers in new orleans came as a surprise to many
1715,since then the phenomenon has expanded exponentially with local police forces across the country outfitted to the gills with militarygrade gear including tanks and drones and private security companies frequently providing training and support
1716,given the array of privatemilitary and security contractors occupying key positions in the trump administration we can expect all of this to expand further with each new shock
1717,the katrina experience also stands as a stark warning to those who are holding out hope for trump’s promised trillion dollars in infrastructure spending
1718,that spending will fix some roads and bridges and it will create jobs thoughas we’ll see in chapter 10 far less than green infrastructure investment to transition off fossil fuels would
1719,crucially trump has indicated that he plans to do as much as possible not through the public sector but through publicprivate partnershipswhich have a terrible track record for corruption and may result in far lower wages than true public works projects would
1720,given trump’s business record and pence’s role in the administration there is every reason to fear that his bigticket infrastructure spending could become a katrinalike kleptocracy a government of thieves with the maralago set helping themselves to vast sums of taxpayer money
1721,new orleans provides a harrowing picture of what we can expect when the next shock hits
1722,but sadly it is far from complete there is much more that this administration may try to push through under cover of crisis
1723,to become shock resistant we need to prepare for that too
1724,chapter nine the toxic todo list what to expect when you are expecting a crisis in new orleans after katrina some of the key players who now surround trump showed to what lengths they will go to decimate the public sphere and advance the interests of real estate developers private contractors and oil companies
1725,today they are in a position to take katrina national
1726,what makes this constellation of disaster capitalists all the more worrying is the fact that though trump has been able to do a great deal of damage in his first few months in office he has been repeatedly stymied by the courts and by congress
1727,and many of the more radical items on this administration’s wish list have yet to be attempted at all
1728,his education secretary betsy devos for instance has devoted her life to pushing for a privatized education system like the one in new orleans after katrina
1729,many of the figures who surround trump are passionate about dismantling social security
1730,several are equally fervent in their distaste for a free press unions and political protests
1731,trump himself has mused publicly about bringing in “the feds” to deal with crime in cities like chicago and on the campaign trail he pledged to block all muslims from entering the us not just the ones from the countries on his various lists
1732,his attorney general jeff sessions has been highly critical of police department “consent decrees” an important measure that allows the justice department and federal courts to intervene in local and state police forces if they identify a pattern of abusefor example repeated shootings of unarmed black people
1733,sessions claims these accountability mechanisms “can reduce morale for the police officers” impairing their ability to fight crime a claim unsupported by the data
1734,the wealthiest funders of trump’s campaign and of the far right more broadlythe multibillionaire koch brothers and the mercer familyhave their sights set on eliminating the remaining restrictions on money in politics while doing away with those laws that require transparency in how such private money is spent
1735,under the guise of battling a manufactured “voting fraud” crisis they are also backing groups that have been pushing measures to make it even harder for lowincome people and minorities to vote such as rules requiring photo id to cast a ballot some form of these initiatives had already been enacted in at least thirtytwo states by the time trump was elected
1736,if these twin goals are fully realized progressive challengers will be so outspent by their republican rivals and will have so much trouble getting their supporters into voting booths that the corporate coup trump represents could well become permanent
1737,realizing the full breadth of this antidemocratic vision is not achievable in the current circumstances
1738,without a crisis the courts would keep getting in the way as would several state governments controlled by democrats and on some of trump’s more sadistic dreamslike bringing back tortureeven congress might stand up to him
1739,but the full agenda is still there lying in wait
1740,which is why author and journalist peter maass writing in the intercept  described the trump white house as “a pistol cocked to go off at the first touch”or rather the first crisis
1741,as milton friedman wrote long ago “only a crisisactual or perceivedproduces real change
1742,when that crisis occurs the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around
1743,that i believe is our basic function to develop alternatives to existing policies to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable” survivalists stockpile canned goods and water in preparation for major disasters these guys stockpile spectacularly antidemocratic ideas
1744,so the questions we need to focus on are these what disaster or series of disasters could play the enabling role
1745,and what tasks on the toxic todo list are most likely to rear their heads at these first opportunities
1746,it’s high time for some disaster preparedness
1747,states of emergency states of exception during the campaign some imagined that the more overtly racist elements of trump’s platform were just talk designed to rile up the base not anything he seriously intended to act on
1748,in trump’s first week in office when he imposed a travel ban on seven majority muslim countries that comforting illusion disappeared fast
1749,and the response was immediate
1750,in major cities across the united states thousands upon thousands of people left their homes and flooded to the airports demanding that the ban be revoked and that the travelers being detained be released
1751,taxi drivers in new york refused to take fares to or from jfk airport local politicians and lawyers showed up in droves to help the people under detention and a federal court judge finally intervened to block the ban
1752,when trump slightly modified his executive order and reissued it another judge got in his way
1753,the whole episode showed the power of resistance and of judicial courage and there was much to celebrate
1754,but we can’t forget that a terrorist attack in the united states would provide the administration with a pretext to try to override much of this kind of pushback
1755,in all likelihood they would do it swiftly by declaring protests and strikes that block roads and airports a threat to “national security” and then using that cover to go after protest organizerswith surveillance arrests and imprisonment
1756,many of us well remember the “with us or with the terrorists” atmosphere that descended after september 11 but we don’t need to go back that far to see how these dynamics work
1757,in the immediate aftermath of the westminster terror attacks in london in march 2017 when a driver plowed into a crowd of pedestrians deliberately killing four people and injuring dozens more the conservative government wasted no time declaring that any expectation of privacy in digital communications was now a threat to national security
1758,home secretary amber rudd went on the bbc and declared the endtoend encryption provided by programs like whatsapp to be “completely unacceptable” and she said that they were meeting with the large tech firms “to ask them to work with us” on providing backdoor access to these platforms
1759,in france in 2015 after the coordinated attacks in paris that killed 130 people the government of françois hollande declared a “state of emergency” that banned political protests
1760,i was in france a week after those horrific events and it was striking that though the attackers had targeted a concert a football stadium restaurants and other emblems of daily parisian life it was only outdoor political activity that was not permitted
1761,large concerts christmas markets and sporting events the sorts of places that were likely targets for further attackswere all free to carry on as usual
1762,in the months that followed the stateofemergency decree was extended again and againuntil it had been in place for well over a year
1763,it is currently set to remain in effect until at least july 2017the new normal
1764,and this took place under a centerleft government in a country with a long tradition of disruptive strikes and protests
1765,one would have to be naive to imagine that donald trump and mike pence wouldn’t immediately seize on any attack in the usa to go much further down that same road
1766,we should be prepared for security shocks to be exploited as excuses to increase the rounding up and incarceration of large numbers of people from the communities this administration is already targeting latino immigrants muslims black lives matter organizers climate activists
1767,it’s all possible
1768,and in the name of freeing the hands of law enforcement officials sessions would have his excuse to do away with federal oversight of state and local police
1769,unfortunately there is no guarantee that in the aftermath of an attack judges would show the same courage in standing up to trump as they did immediately after his inauguration
1770,as much as they position themselves as neutral arbiters courts are not immune to public hysteria
1771,and there is no doubt that the president would seize on any domestic terrorist attack to blame the courts
1772,he made this abundantly clear when he tweeted after his first travel ban was struck down “just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril
1773,if something happens blame him and court system” the dark prince is back trump has made no secret of his interest in torture
1774,“torture works” he said on the campaign “only a stupid person would say it doesn’t work” he also pledged to fill up guantanamo with new “bad dudes believe me we’re gonna load it up” legally this won’t be easy
1775,ever since the george w bush administration found loopholes it could exploit to take a turn toward sadism the us courts have made it harder for future administrations to follow suit as has the senate which passed an amendment in 2015 clearly stating that all interrogation techniques must follow the army field manual
1776,still if the country found itself in the grip of a largeenough security crisis there is no reason to expect that a republicancontrolled house and senate would refuse the white house the powers it demanded
1777,and mike pompeo trump’s cia director has indicated an alarming openness to going backward
1778,after originally stating unequivocally in his confirmation hearing that he would not allow torture tactics to return he followed up with an addendum “if experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country i would want to understand such impediments and whether any recommendations were appropriate for changing current law” he has also called for a reversal of the limited restrictions on digital surveillance put in place after edward snowden’s revelations
1779,even without the blessing of congress or the cia an administration that is determined to violate the law can unfortunately find a way
1780,the likeliest route for trump is to outsource this dirty work to private contractors
1781,none other than blackwater founder erik prince who happens to be the brother of secretary of education betsy devos has been counseling trump behind the scenes
1782,investigative journalist jeremy scahill who wrote an awardwinning book on blackwater reports that prince not only donated 100000 to a trumpfriendly political action committee but actively advised the transition team “on matters related to intelligence and defense including weighing in on candidates for the defense and state departments” and in april the washington post published a report revealing that the united arab emirates arranged a secret meeting in january between blackwater founder erik prince and a russian close to president vladimir putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a backchannel line of communication between moscow and presidentelect donald trump according to us european and arab officials
1783,the meeting took place around jan 11nine days before trump’s inaugurationin the seychelles islands in the indian ocean officials said
1784,prince the post reported “presented himself as an unofficial envoy for trump” through a spokesperson prince described the account as “a complete fabrication
1785,the meeting had nothing to do with president trump” prince’s appearance in all this is alarming for reasons that go well beyond the revelation of yet another link between the trump team and russia
1786,in the wake of a long line of lawsuits and investigations in 2014 a us federal jury found four blackwater employees guilty on charges including firstdegree murder in a massacre in baghdad’s nisour square that left seventeen people dead prince attempted to rename blackwater and finally sold the company
1787,he now has a new firm frontier services group
1788,he is getting in on the antiimmigrant frenzy sweeping the globe pitching the company as the most efficient way to keep migrants from successfully crossing borders
1789,in europe he makes the case that by paying his company to work in libya countries can “secure land borders and so prevent migrants from reaching the mediterranean” writing in the financial times in early 2017 prince explained that if his plan were implemented “there would be nowhere for migrant smugglers to hide they can be detected detained and handled using a mixture of air and ground operations” all private all forprofit
1790,prince’s resurfacing is a reminder that there are many backdoor ways around constitutional practices
1791,and trump as well as other leaders can turn to companies like his for surveillance interrogation and massively rampedup border controls
1792,no they don’t need to plan it some have warned that trump has so much to gain from an atmosphere of heightened fear and confusion and such a blatant disregard for the truth that we should expect this administration to cook up its own crises
1793,while it would be unwise to put anything past this constellation of characters the fact is that nefarious conspiracies may well be unnecessary
1794,after all trump’s reckless and incompetent approach to governance is nothing short of a disastercreation machine
1795,take the administration’s incendiary public statements and policies relating to muslims and “radical islamic terrorism” a decade and a half into the socalled war on terror it’s not controversial to state the obvious these kinds of actions and rhetoric make violent responses distinctly more likely
1796,these days the people warning about this danger most forcefully are not antiracism or antiwar activists but leading figures in the military and intelligence communities and the foreign policy establishment
1797,they argue that any perception that the united states is at war with islam as a faith and muslims as a group is a gift to extremists looking to rationalize bloody attacks on american soldiers and civilians
1798,daniel l bynam a senior fellow at the brookings institution who served on the joint 911 inquiry staff of the house and senate intelligence committees puts it this way “trump’s actions and rhetoric add credibility to the jihadists’ narrative of civilizational war” already isis reportedly described trump’s first antimuslimtravel executive order as a “blessed ban” that will help to recruit fighters
1799,iran’s foreign minister warned the ban was “a gift to extremists” even trump’s own national security adviser lieutenant general hr
1800,mcmaster has described trump’s repeated use of the term “radical islamic terrorism” as unhelpful because he says the terrorists are “unislamic” yet nothing has changed
1801,trump seems determined to do everything possible to reinforce the holy war message
1802,the idea that trump doesn’t realize how provocative he’s being rings about as hollow as his claims of being unaware that his racist rhetoric has generated a climate ripe for hate crimes
1803,the shock of war the most lethal way that governments overreact to terrorist attacks is by exploiting the atmosphere of fear to embark on a fullblown foreign war
1804,it doesn’t necessarily matter if the target has no connection to the original terror attacks
1805,iraq wasn’t responsible for 911 and it was invaded anyway
1806,trump’s likeliest targets are mostly in the middle east and they include but are by no means limited to the following syria yemen where trump has already increased the number of drone strikes iraq where deadly strikes with high civilian casualties are also on the rise and most perilously iran
1807,and then of course there’s north korea
1808,already after visiting the demilitarized zone dividing north and south korea secretary of state tillerson declared “all options are on the table” pointedly refusing to rule out a preemptive military strike in response to the north korean regime’s missile testing
1809,this was followed by trump’s muscleflexing announcement of the immediate deployment of a us navy strike group including two destroyers a guidedmissile cruiser and a nuclearpowered aircraft carrier to the korean peninsula embarrassingly for the administration the carrier was photographed thousands of miles away heading in the opposite direction for joint exercises with the australian navy
1810,and it was all underlined by a testosteronefueled tweet from trump about how if china doesn’t step in “we will solve the problem without them
1811,usa” north korean state media meanwhile issued a hairraising declaration that the country was prepared to launch a nuclear attack “in the us mainland” trump has openly called for a new nuclear “arms race”a call we have not heard since the 1980s
1812,he has reportedly asked his foreign policy advisers repeatedly why the united states can’t just use nuclear weapons seemingly not grasping the principle of retaliation
1813,and one of trump’s biggest financial backers sheldon adelson has talked about needing to threaten iran with a nuclear strike in the “middle of the desert that doesn’t hurt a soulmaybe a couple of rattlesnakes
1814,then you say ‘see
1815,the next one is in the middle of tehran
1816,so we mean business’ ” adelson donated 5 million to trump’s inauguration the largest donation of its kind ever
1817,i am not saying a nuclear war is likely
1818,but in trump’s very short time in office there has already been a level of military escalation that is both chilling and bizarrely haphazard
1819,as indicated by his early deployment of the most powerful conventional weapon in the us arsenalthe massive ordnance air blast or moabtrump is drunk on the allure of showing the world he’s top dog
1820,which is why mikhail gorbachev who worked toward disarmament when he was soviet leader wrote in time magazine that today “the nuclear threat once again seems real
1821,relations between the great powers have been going from bad to worse for several years now
1822,the advocates for arms build up and the militaryindustrial complex are rubbing their hands” and that was before trump upped the ante with north korea
1823,there are many reasons why people around trump particularly the many who came straight from the defense sector might decide that further military escalation is in order
1824,as we saw trump’s april 2017 missile strike on syriaordered without congressional approval and therefore illegal according to some expertswon him the most positive news coverage of his presidency with liberal hawks fawning over him as enthusiastically as his superfans on fox
1825,his inner circle meanwhile immediately pointed to the attacks as proof that there was nothing untoward going on between the white house and russia
1826,“if there was anything that syria did it was to validate the fact that there is no russia tie” trump’s 33yearold son eric told the daily telegraph perhaps inadvertently revealing that there might have been more than sympathy for “beautiful babies” behind the decision to stage such a dramatic strike
1827,exxon’s wars there is another reason why this administration might rush to exploit a security crisis to start a new war or escalate an ongoing conflict there is no faster or more effective way to drive up the price of oil especially if the violence interferes with oil supplies making it to the world market
1828,particularly worrying on this front is secretary of state rex tillerson’s relationship with exxonmobil one of the oil giants that would benefit most directly from a price spike
1829,yes tillerson agreed to divest from the company and to recuse himself from decisions that specifically relate to exxonmobil for one year
1830,but his ties to the company remain deep
1831,not only was tillerson at exxon for fortyone years his entire working life but exxonmobil has agreed to pay him a retirement package worth a staggering 180 million a sum so large especially given how far the company’s fortunes fell under his leadership that it may well inspire some feelings of gratitude in the secretary of state
1832,how would you feel about a corporation that provided you with a 180million exit package
1833,as tom sanzillo director of finance at the institute for energy economics and financial analysis puts it “you can take the boy out of exxon but you cannot take the exxon out of the boy” moreover while tillerson may be excluded from decisions relating to infrastructure in which exxonmobil has a clear interest such as approval of the keystone xl pipeline he cannot recuse himself from the many foreign policy decisions that could impact oil prices decisions potentially worth billions to the company
1834,that after all would mean recusing himself from any discussion of military conflict in oilrich regions or direct discussion with the leaders of petrostates
1835,we have already seen that tillerson is doing no such thing
1836,the link between war and oil prices is not hypothetical
1837,when oil prices go down instability increases in oildependent countries such as venezuela and russia
1838,conversely when conflict breaks out in countries with considerable oil assetswhether nigeria or kuwait the price of oil shoots up as markets anticipate a contraction in supply
1839, the price of oil even got a small bump when trump ordered the april missile strike on syria
1840,“there is a close correlation between oil prices and conflict” explains michael klare professor of peace and world security studies at hampshire college
1841,exhibit a of this phenomenon was the 2003 invasion of iraq which helped send the price of oil soaring from around 30 a barrel at the start of the invasion to above 100 by 2008 that in turn is what triggered the boom in tar sands investment and the rush to the arctic
1842,and this dynamic could be repeated
1843,a war that takes large stateowned oil reserves offline or which significantly weakens the power of opec  would be a boon for the oil majors
1844,exxonmobil loaded with tar sands reserves and with megaprojects pending in the russian arctic would have a huge amount to gain
1845,perhaps the only person who would have more to gain from this kind of instability is vladimir putin head of a vast petrostate that has been in economic crisis since the price of oil collapsed
1846,russia is the world’s leading exporter of natural gas and its secondlargest exporter of oil after saudi arabia
1847,when the price was high this was great news for putin prior to 2014 fully 50 percent of russia’s budget revenues came from oil and gas
1848,but when prices plummeted the government was suddenly short hundreds of billions of dollars an economic catastrophe that has had tremendous human costs
1849,according to the world bank in 2015 real wages fell in russia by nearly 10 percent russia’s currency the ruble depreciated by close to 40 percent and the population of people classified as poor increased from 3 million to over 19 million
1850,putin plays the strongman but this economic crisis makes him vulnerable at home
1851,which is why many have speculated that russia’s highrisk military involvement in syria is partly driven by a desire to get oil prices back up
1852,this theory has been floated most prominently by alexander temerko a rightwing ukrainianborn british businessman who works in the oil industry
1853,in 2015 temerko wrote in the guardian  prolonged war in the middle east would serve putin’s interests perfectly
1854,the deeper and more widespread the conflict the more world oil and gas prices are likely to rise helping him stage an economic recovery at home and render the sanctions useless
1855,ushering in better times at home is therefore putin’s ultimate aim as he seeks to prop up a system that takes advantage of people’s patriotism and public spirit
1856,the grand plan is for his vital oil and gas revenues to recover so he can buy the loyalty of russia’s 140 millionstrong population
1857,this is something of an oversimplification putin has other reasons for being in syria as well including a desire to access the country’s ports and potentially its oil and gas fieldsand war as ever is a great distraction from the misery at home
1858,we’ve also heard a lot about how exxonmobil made a massive deal with the russian state oil company rosneft to drill for oil in the arctic which putin bragged was worth half a trillion dollars
1859,that deal was derailed by us sanctions against russia imposed under the obama administration
1860,it is still eminently possible despite the posturing on both sides over syria that trump could lift those sanctions and clear the way for that deal to go ahead which would quickly boost exxonmobil’s flagging fortunes
1861,months after trump took office the company requested a waiver from the us sanctions and was denied
1862,but even if the sanctions are lifted there is another factor standing in the way of the project moving forward the depressed price of oil
1863,tillerson made the deal with rosneft in 2011 when the price of oil was soaring at around 110 a barrel
1864,their first commitment was to explore for oil in the sea north of siberia under toughtoextract icy conditions
1865,since the oil price collapse other oil majors including shell and france’s total have backed away from arctic drilling in part because frozen conditions drive up costs so much
1866, the breakeven price for arctic drilling is estimated to be around 100 a barrel if not more
1867,so even if sanctions are lifted under trump it won’t make sense for exxon and rosneft to move ahead with their project unless oil prices are high enough
1868,in other words both parties have significant and multilayered reasons for wanting the price of oil to shoot back up
1869,which is why we need to be very clear that a state of instability and uncertainty is not something that is feared by core figures in and around the trump administration on the contrary many will embrace it
1870,trump has surrounded himself with masters of chaosfrom tillerson to mnuchin
1871,and chaos has a long track record of sending the price of oil up
1872,if it rises to 80 or more a barrel then the scramble to dig up and burn the dirtiest fossil fuels including those under melting ice will be back on
1873,a price rebound would unleash a global frenzy in new highrisk highcarbon fossil fuel extraction from the arctic to the tar sands
1874,if that is allowed to happen it really would rob us of our last chance of averting catastrophic climate change
1875,so in a very real sense preventing war and averting climate chaos are one and the same fight
1876,economic shocks just as trump could not be unaware that his antimuslim actions and rhetoric make terror attacks more likely i suspect that many in the trump administration are fully cognizant of the fact that their frenzy of financial deregulation makes other kinds of shocks and disasters more likely as well
1877,trump has announced plans to dismantle dodd– frank the most substantive piece of legislation introduced after the 2008 banking collapse
1878,dodd–frank wasn’t tough enough but its absence will liberate wall street to go wild blowing new bubbles which will inevitably burst creating new economic shocks
1879,trump’s team are not unaware of this they are simply unconcerned the profits from those market bubbles are too tantalizing
1880,besides they know that since the banks were never broken up they are still too big to fail which means that if it all comes crashing down they will be bailed out again just like in 2008
1881,in fact trump issued an executive order calling for a review of the specific part of dodd–frank designed to prevent taxpayers from being stuck with the bill for another such bailoutan ominous sign especially with so many former goldman executives making white house policy
1882,some members of the administration surely also see a few coveted policy options opening up in the wake of a good market shock or two
1883,during the campaign trump courted voters by promising not to touch social security or medicare
1884,but that may well be untenable given the deep tax cuts on the way
1885,an economic crisis would give trump a handy excuse for abandoning those promises
1886,in the midst of a moment being sold to the public as economic armageddon betsy devos might even have a shot at realizing her dream of replacing public schools with a system based on vouchers and charters
1887,trump’s gang has a long wish list of policies that do not lend themselves to normal times
1888,in the early days of the new administration for instance mike pence met with wisconsin governor scott walker to hear how the governor had managed to strip public sector unions of their right to collective bargaining in 2011
1889,hint he used the cover of the state’s fiscal crisis prompting new york times columnist paul krugman to declare that in wisconsin “the shock doctrine is on full display” the picture is clear
1890,we will very likely not see this administration’s full economic barbarism in the first year
1891,that will only reveal itself later after the inevitable budget crises and market shocks kick in
1892,then in the name of rescuing the government and perhaps the entire economy the white house will start checking off the more challenging items on the corporate wish list
1893,weather shocks just as trump’s national security and economic policies are sure to generate and deepen crises the administration’s moves to ramp up fossil fuel production dismantle large parts of the country’s environmental laws and trash the paris climate accord all pave the way for more largescale industrial accidentsnot to mention future climate disasters
1894,there is a lag time of about a decade between the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and the full resulting warming so the very worst climatic effects of the administration’s policies won’t likely be felt until they’re out of office
1895,that said we’ve already locked in so much warming that no president can complete a term without facing major weatherrelated disasters
1896,in fact trump wasn’t even two months in before he was dealing with overwhelming wildfires on the great plains which led to so many cattle deaths that one rancher described the event as “our hurricane katrina” trump showed no great interest in the fires not even sparing them a tweet
1897,but when the first superstorm hits a coast we should expect a very different reaction from a president who knows the value of oceanfront property and has only ever been interested in building for the one percent
1898,the worry of course is a repeat of katrina’s ripoffs and iraq’s “missing billions” since contracts handed out in a hurry are ripe for corruption and it is evacuees and workers who pay the price
1899,luxury disaster response the biggest trumpera escalation however will most likely be in disaster response services marketed specifically toward the wealthy what a new yorker headline recently dubbed “doomsday prep for the superrich” when i was writing the shock doctrine  this industry was still in its infancy and several early companies didn’t make it
1900,i wrote for instance about a shortlived airline called help jet based in trump’s beloved west palm beach
1901,while it lasted help jet offered an array of goldplated rescue services in exchange for a membership fee
1902,when a hurricane was on its way help jet dispatched limousines to pick up members booked them into fivestar golf resorts and spas somewhere safe then whisked them away on private jets
1903,“no standing in lines no hassle with crowds just a firstclass experience that turns a problem into a vacation” read the company’s marketing materials
1904,“enjoy the feeling of avoiding the usual hurricane evacuation nightmare” with the benefit of hindsight it seems help jet far from misjudging the market for these services was simply ahead of its time
1905,these days luxury real estate developments in new york have begun marketing exclusive private disaster amenities to wouldbe residentseverything from emergency lighting to private water pumps and generators to thirteenfoot floodgates
1906,one manhattan condominium boasts of its watertight utility rooms sealed “submarinestyle” in case another superstorm sandy hits the coast
1907,trump’s golf courses are trying to prepare too
1908,in ireland trump international golf links and hotel applied to build a twomilelong thirteenfoot wall to protect the coastal property from rising seas and increasingly dangerous storms
1909,evan osnos recently reported in the new yorker that in silicon valley and on wall street the more serious highend survivalists are hedging against climate disruption and social collapse by buying space in custombuilt underground bunkers in kansas protected by heavily armed mercenaries and building escape homes on high ground in new zealand
1910,it goes without saying that you need your own private jet to get therethe ultimate green zone
1911,at the ultraextreme end of this trend is paypal billionaire peter thiel a major trump donor and member of his transition team
1912,thiel underwrote an initiative called the seasteading institute cofounded by patri friedman grandson of milton in 2008 the goal of seasteading is for wealthy people to eventually secede into fully independent nationstates floating in the open oceanprotected from sealevel rise and fully selfsufficient
1913,anybody who doesn’t like being taxed or regulated will simply be able to as the movement’s manifesto states “vote with your boat” thiel recently has appeared to lose interest in the project saying that the logistics of building floating nationstates were “not quite feasible” but it continues
1914,what is worrying about the entire topoftheline survivalist phenomenon apart from its general weirdness is that as the wealthy create their own luxury escape hatches there is diminishing incentive to maintain any kind of disaster response infrastructure that exists to help everyone regardless of incomeprecisely the dynamic that led to enormous and unnecessary suffering in new orleans during katrina
1915,the survivalists refer to fema as “foolishly expecting meaningful aid”a joke that is only funny if you have the means to pay cash for your own escape
1916,this twotiered disaster infrastructure is galloping ahead at alarming speed
1917,in fireprone states such as california and colorado insurance companies provide a “concierge” service to their exclusive clients when wildfires threaten their mansions the companies dispatch teams of private firefighters to coat them in fireretardant
1918,the public sphere meanwhile is left to further decay
1919,california provides a glimpse of where this is all headed
1920,for its firefighting the state relies on upwards of 4500 prison inmates who are paid a dollar an hour when they’re on the fire line putting their lives at risk battling wildfires and about two bucks a day when they’re back at camp
1921,by some estimates california saves about a billion dollars a year through this programa snapshot of what happens when you mix austerity politics with mass incarceration and climate change
1922,i don’t feel hotdo you feel hot
1923,the uptick in highend disaster prep also means there is less reason for the big winners in our economy to embrace the demanding policy changes required to prevent an even warmer and more disasterprone future
1924,which might help explain the trump administration’s determination to do everything possible to accelerate the climate crisis
1925,so far much of the discussion around trump’s environmental rollbacks has focused on supposed schisms between the members of his inner circle who actively deny climate science including epa head scott pruitt and trump himself and those who concede that humans are indeed contributing to planetary warming such as rex tillerson and ivanka trump
1926,but this misses the point what everyone who surrounds trump shares is a confidence that they their children and indeed their class will be just fine that their wealth and connections will protect them from the worst of the shocks to come
1927,they will lose some beachfront property sure but nothing that can’t be replaced with a new mansion in the mountains
1928,what matters isn’t their stated views on the science of climate change
1929,what matters is that not one of them appears to be worried about climate change
1930,the early catastrophic events are playing out mostly in poor parts of the world where the people are not white
1931,and when disasters do strike wealthy western nations there are growing numbers of ways for the wealthy to buy their relative safety
1932,early in trump’s term republican congressman steve king caused a controversy by tweeting “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” it was a revealing comment on many fronts
1933,climate change is not a concern for the republican party because a great many people in positions of power clearly think it’ll be “somebody else’s babies” who will shoulder the risks babies who don’t count as much as their own
1934,they may not all be climate deniers but almost every one of them is catastrophically unconcerned
1935,this insouciance is representative of an extremely disturbing trend
1936,in an age of everwidening income inequality a significant cohort of our elites are walling themselves off not just physically but also psychologically mentally detaching themselves from the collective fate of the rest of humanity
1937,this secessionism from the human species if only in their minds liberates them not only to shrug off the urgent need for climate action but also to devise ever more predatory ways to profit from current and future disasters and instability
1938,what we are hurtling toward is the future i glimpsed in new orleans and baghdad all those years ago
1939,a world demarcated into green zones and red zones and black sites for whoever doesn’t cooperate
1940,and it’s headed toward a blackwaterstyle economy in which private players profit from building the walls from putting the population under surveillance from private security and privatized checkpoints
1941,a world of green zones and red zones this is the way our world is being carved up at an alarming rate
1942,europe australia and north america are erecting increasingly elaborate and privatized border fortresses to seal themselves off from people fleeing for their lives
1943,fleeing quite often as a direct result of forces unleashed primarily by those fortressed continents whether predatory trade deals wars or ecological disasters intensified by climate change
1944,hands are wrung about the “migrant crisis”but not nearly so much about the crises driving the migrations
1945,since 2014 an estimated thirteen thousand people have drowned in the mediterranean trying to reach european shores
1946,for those who make it safety is far from assured
1947,the massive migrant camp in calais france was nicknamed “the jungle”an echo of the way katrina’s abandoned people were categorized as “animals” in late 2016 just before trump was elected the calais camp was bulldozed
1948,but it’s the australian government that has gone the furthest in treating human desperation as a contagion
1949,for five consecutive years since 2012 migrant boats headed for australia’s coastline have been systematically intercepted at sea and their occupants flown to remote detention camps on the islands of nauru and manus
1950,numerous reports have described the conditions in the camps as tantamount to torture
1951,but the government shrugs
1952,after all they don’t run the camps private forprofit contractors do of course
1953,conditions are so degraded on nauru that in one week in 2016 two refugees set themselves on fire in an attempt to awaken the world to their plight
1954,it hasn’t worked
1955,prime minister malcolm turnbull continues to refuse demands coming from many australians to welcome the refugees into their vast country
1956,“we cannot be misty eyed about this” he says asserting that australians “have to be very clear and determined in our national purpose” nauru incidentally is one of the pacific islands vulnerable to sea level rise
1957,its residents after seeing their home turned into a prison for people fleeing war in places such as somalia and afghanistan will quite possibly be forced to become migrants themselves
1958,it’s another glimpse into an alreadyhere future tomorrow’s climate refugees recruited into service as today’s prison guards
1959,jets drones and boats the irony is particularly acute because many of the conflicts driving migration today have already been exacerbated by climate change
1960,for instance before civil war broke out in syria the country faced its deepest drought on recordroughly 15 million people were internally displaced as a result
1961,a great many displaced farmers moved to the border city of daraa which happens to be where the syrian uprising broke out in 2011 drought was not the only factor in bringing tensions to a head but many analysts including former secretary of state john kerry are convinced it was a key contributor
1962,in fact if we chart the locations of the most intense conflict spots in the world right nowfrom the bloodiest battlefields in afghanistan and pakistan to libya yemen somalia and iraqwhat becomes clear is that these also happen to be some of the hottest and driest places on earth
1963,the israeli architect eyal weizman has mapped the targets of western drone strikes and found an “astounding coincidence” the strikes are intensely concentrated in regions with an average of just 200 millimeters 78 inches of rainfall per yearso little that even slight climate disruption can push them into drought
1964,in other words we are bombing the driest places on the planet which also happen to be the most destabilized
1965,a frank explanation for this was provided in a us military report published by the center for naval analyses a decade ago “the middle east has always been associated with two natural resources oil because of its abundance and water because of its scarcity” when it comes to oil water and war in the middle east certain patterns have become clear over time
1966,first western fighter jets follow that abundance of oil in the region setting off spirals of violence and destabilization
1967,next come the western drones closely tracking water scarcity as drought and conflict mix together
1968,and just as bombs follow oil and drones follow droughtso now boats follow both
1969,boats filled with refugees fleeing homes ravaged by war and drought in the driest parts of the planet
1970,and the same capacity to discount the humanity of the “other” which justifies civilian deaths and casualties from bombs and drones is now being trained on the people in the boats or arriving on buses or on footcasting their need for security as a threat their desperate flight as some sort of invading army
1971,the dramatic rise in rightwing nationalism antiblack racism islamophobia and straightup white supremacy over the past decade cannot be pried apart from this maelstromfrom the jets and the drones the boats and walls
1972,the only way to justify such untenable levels of inequality is to double down on theories of racial hierarchy that tell a story about how the people being locked out of the global green zone deserve their fate whether it’s trump casting mexicans as rapists and “bad hombres” and syrian refugees as closet terrorists or prominent conservative canadian politician kellie leitch proposing that immigrants be screened for “canadian values” or successive australian prime ministers justifying sinister island detention camps as a “humanitarian” alternative to death at sea
1973,this is what global destabilization looks like in societies that have never redressed their foundational crimescountries that have insisted slavery and indigenous land theft were just glitches in otherwise proud histories
1974,after all there is little more green zonered zone than the economy of the slave plantationof cotillions in the master’s house steps away from torture in the fields all of it taking place on the violently stolen indigenous land on which north america’s wealth was built
1975,what is becoming clear is that the same theories of racial hierarchy that justified those violent thefts in the name of building the industrial age are visibly resurfacing as the system of wealth and comfort they constructed starts to unravel on multiple fronts simultaneously
1976,trump is just one early and vicious manifestation of that unraveling
1977,he is not alone
1978,he won’t be the last
1979,a crisis of imagination searching for a word to describe the huge discrepancies in privileges and safety between those in iraq’s green and red zones journalists often landed on “scifi” and of course it was
1980,the walled city where the wealthy few live in relative luxury while the masses outside war with one another for survival is pretty much the default premise of every dystopian scifi movie that gets made these days from the hunger games  with the decadent capitol versus the desperate colonies to elysium  with its spalike elite space station hovering above a sprawling and lethal favela
1981,it’s a vision deeply enmeshed with the dominant western religions with their grand narratives of great floods washing the world clean with only a chosen few selected to begin again
1982,it’s the story of the great fires that sweep in burning up the unbelievers and taking the righteous to a gated city in the sky
1983,we have collectively imagined this extreme winnersandlosers ending for our species so many times that one of our most pressing tasks is learning to imagine other possible ends to the human story ones in which we come together in crisis rather than split apart take down borders rather than erect more of them
1984,because we all pretty much know where the road we are on is leading
1985,it leads to a world of katrinas a world that confirms our most catastrophic nightmares
1986,though there is a thriving subculture of utopian scifi the current crops of mainstream dystopian books and films imagine and reimagine that same green zonered zone future over and over again
1987,but the point of dystopian art is not to act as a temporal gps showing us where we are inevitably headed
1988,the point is to warn us to wake usso that seeing where this perilous road leads we can decide to swerve
1989,“we have it in our power to begin the world over again” so said thomas paine many years ago neatly summarizing the dream of escaping the past that is at the heart of both the colonial project and the american dream
1990,the truth however is that we do not have this godlike power of reinvention nor did we ever
1991,we must live with the messes and mistakes we have made as well as within the limits of what our planet can sustain
1992,but we do have it in our power to change ourselves to attempt to right past wrongs and to repair our relationships with one another and with the planet we share
1993,it’s this work that is the bedrock of shock resistance
1994,part iv how things could get better she’s on the horizoni go two steps she moves two steps away 
1995,i walk ten steps and the horizon runs ten steps ahead 
1996,no matter how much i walk i’ll never reach her 
1997,what good is utopia
1998,that’s what it’s good for walking 
1999,eduardo galeano walking words  1995 chapter ten when the shock doctrine backfires when i was in my late teens my mother had a debilitating series of strokes which turned out to have been caused by a brain tumor
2000,the first stroke came as a complete shockshe was younger than i am now physically active and professionally driven
2001,one minute she was biking the next she was in a neurological icu incapable of moving or of breathing without a respirator
2002,up until my mother’s stroke i had been a pretty difficult teenageri was withdrawn from my parents wild with my friends serially dishonest
2003,i did well at school for the most part my one saving grace but home life was strained or worse
2004,in the instant that my mother’s life changed forever i did too
2005,i discovered i knew how to be helpful
2006,affectionate imagine
2007,i grew up overnight
2008,after brain surgery she gradually recovered some though far from all of her mobility
2009,watching her adapt to a different life as a disabled person i learned a lot about the power of humans to find new reserves of strength
2010,it is true that people can regress during times of crisis
2011,i have seen it many times
2012,in a shocked state with our understanding of the world badly shaken a great many of us can become childlike and passive and overly trusting of people who are only too happy to abuse that trust
2013,but i also know from my own family’s navigation of a shocking event that there can be the inverse response as well
2014,we can evolve and grow up in a crisis and set aside all kinds of bullshitfast
2015,resistance memory and the limits to no this is true for whole societies as well
2016,faced with a shared trauma or a common threat communities can come together in defiant acts of sanity and maturity
2017,it has happened before and the early signs are good that it might be happening again
2018,the trump administration is coming after huge sectors of the population at once tens of millions of people impacted by proposed budget cuts civil rights activists artists indigenous tribes immigrants climate scientiststheir military belligerence and environmental arson are attacks that reach far outside us borders to wage war on global stability and planetary habitability
2019,it’s clear that like many shock therapists before them trump and his gang are betting that this allatonce strategy will overwhelm their adversaries sending them scrambling in all directions and ultimately causing them to give up out of sheer exhaustion or a sense of futility
2020,this blitzkrieg strategy though it has often worked in the past is actually quite highrisk
2021,the danger of starting fights on so many fronts is that if it doesn’t succeed in demoralizing your opponents it could very well unite them
2022,on the day trump signed the permit approving the keystone xl oil pipeline ponca nation member mekasi camp horinek shared a version of this theory with reporter alleen brown i want to say thank you to the president for all the bad decisions that he’s makingfor the bad cabinet appointments that he’s made and for awakening a sleeping giant
2023,people that have never stood up for themselves people that have never had their voices heard that have never put their bodies on the line are now outraged
2024,i would like to say thank you to president trump for his bigotry for his sexism for bringing all of us in this nation together to stand up and unite
2025,when argentina said no because shock tactics rely on the public becoming disoriented by fast moving events they tend to backfire most spectacularly in places where there is a strong collective memory of previous instances when fear and trauma were exploited to undermine democracy
2026,those memories serve as a kind of shock absorber providing populations with shared reference points that allow them to name what’s happening and fight back
2027,it’s a lesson i learned when i glimpsed another kind of future on the streets of buenos aires over fifteen years ago
2028,at the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002 argentina was in the grips of an economic crisis so severe that it stunned the world
2029,in the 1990s the country had opened itself to corporate globalization so rapidly and so thoroughly that the international monetary fund held it up as a model student
2030,the iconic logos of global banks hotel chains and us fastfood restaurants glowed from the buenos aires skyline and its new shopping malls were so fashionable and luxurious that they frequently drew comparisons with paris
2031,time magazine on its cover declared argentina’s economy a “miracle” and then it all came crashing down
2032,amidst a spiraling debt crisis the government attempted to impose a new round of economic austerity and all those gleaming global banks had to board up their windows and doors to prevent customers rushing in to withdraw their life savings
2033,protests spread across the country
2034,in the suburbs supermarkets owned by european chains were looted
2035,in the midst of this chaotic scene fernando de la rúa then argentina’s president went on television his face shiny with sweat and announced that the country was under attack from “groups that are enemies of order who are looking to spread discord and violence” he declared a thirtyday state of siegewhich gave him the power to suspend a range of constitutional guarantees including freedom of the pressand ordered everyone to stay in their homes
2036,for many argentinians the president’s words sounded like a prelude to a military coupand that proved a fatal misstep
2037,people no matter their age knew their history including the fact that when the military staged its brutal coup in 1976 the need to restore public order against internal enemies had been the pretext
2038,the junta stayed in power until 1983 and in that time it stole the lives of some thirty thousand people
2039,determined not to lose their country again and even while de la rúa was still on television ordering people to stay in their homes buenos aires’s famed central square plaza de mayo filled up with tens of thousands of people many banging pots and pans with spoons and forks a wordless but roaring rebuke to the president’s instructions
2040,argentinians would not give up their basic freedoms in the name of order
2041,not again not this time
2042,and then this great gathering found its voice and a single rebellious cry rose up from the crowds of grandmothers and high school students motorcycle couriers and unemployed factory workers their words directed at the politicians the bankers the imf and every other “expert” who claimed to have the perfect recipe for argentina’s prosperity and stability “ ¡que se vayan todos
2043,”everyone must go
2044,demonstrators stayed in the streets even after protesters were killed in clashes with police bringing the total who lost their lives across the country to more than twenty
2045,amidst the mayhem the president was forced to lift the state of siege and flee the presidential palace in a helicopter
2046,as a new president was appointed the people would rise up and reject him in disgustagain and then again flipping through three presidents in just three weeks
2047,meanwhile in the rubble of argentina’s democracy something strange and wonderful started to happen neighbors poked their heads out of their apartments and houses and in the absence of a political leadership or a stable government began to talk to each other
2048,to think together
2049,a month later there were already some 250 “ asambleas barriales ” neighborhood assemblies small and large in downtown buenos aires alone
2050,picture occupy wall streetbut everywhere
2051,the streets parks and plazas were filled with meetings as people stayed up late into the night planning arguing testifyingand voting on everything from whether argentina should pay its foreign debts to when the next protest should be held to how to support a group of workers who had turned their abandoned factory into a democratic cooperative
2052,many of those first assemblies were as much group therapy as political meetings
2053,participants spoke about their experience of isolation in a city of 13 million
2054,academics and shopkeepers apologized for not watching out for each other publicity managers admitted that they used to look down on unemployed factory workers assuming they deserved their plight never imagining that the crisis would reach the bank accounts of the cosmopolitan middle class
2055,and apologies for presentday wrongs soon gave way to tearful confessions about events dating back to the dictatorship
2056,i witnessed a housewife stand up and publicly admit that three decades earlier when she heard yet another story about someone’s brother or husband being kidnapped by the junta she had learned to close her heart to the suffering telling herself “ por algo será ”it must have been for something
2057,they were trying to understand together how they had lost so much in the past and building relationships to prevent those mistakes from ever being repeated
2058,and from below they were changing the story of a nation
2059,the political changes that came out of argentina’s uprising were far from utopian
2060,the government that eventually restored democracy headed first by néstor kirchner and then by his wife cristina was masterful at reading the street and channeled enough of its spirit and demands to preside over more than a decade of progressive if scandalmarred rule
2061,to this day debates rage about how more could have been made from that unique political moment if the popular movements had been ready with their own plan for taking power and governing differently
2062,yet it’s undeniable that in resisting de la rúa’s austerity plans and defying his order to stay home argentinians saved themselves from years of economic bloodletting
2063,when spain said no another example of how historical memory can serve as a powerful shock absorber took place a few years later in spain
2064,on march 11 2004 ten bombs ripped through commuter trains and rail stations in madrid killing nearly two hundred people
2065,because it was an attack on a transit system that almost everyone in madrid used the sense that anyone could be the next victim spread rapidly through the city as it would in paris more than a decade later when simultaneous attacks terrorized that city
2066,an official investigation found that the attacks had been staged by a terrorist cell inspired by al qaeda reportedly in retaliation for spain’s participation in the usled invasion of iraq
2067,yet spain’s prime minister at the time josé maría aznar immediately went on television and told spaniards to blame the basque separatists andin a bizarre non sequiturto support his unpopular decision to participate in the iraq war
2068,“no negotiation is possible or desirable with these assassins who so many times have sown death all around spain
2069,only with firmness can we end the attacks” aznar said
2070,in the united states after 911 many including most of the media saw the “with us or with the terrorists” rhetoric of george w bush and dick cheney as evidence of strong leadership and handed them enormous new powers to fight what would become the neverending “war on terror” turkey’s autocratic president recep tayyip erdoğan would pull off something even more draconian after a failed coup attempt in 2016 later locking in sweeping new powers in a referendum
2071,and yet when aznar tried similar tactics on his grief stricken population they were not seen as evidence of strong leadership but rather as an ominous sign of a resurgent fascism
2072,“we are still hearing the echoes of franco” said josé antonio martines soler a prominent madrid newspaper editor who had been persecuted under francisco franco’s dictatorship which terrorized the country for thirtysix years
2073,“in every act in every gesture in every sentence aznar told the people he was right that he was the owner of the truth and those who disagreed with him were his enemies” so over the next two days remembering a time when fear had governed their country spaniards surged into the streets in impressive numbers saying no to fear and to terrorismbut also to government lies and the iraq war
2074,all of this happened to be on the eve of national elections and voters seized the opportunity to defeat aznar and vote in a party that promised to pull spanish troops out of iraq
2075,it was the collective memory of past shocks that made spain resistant to new ones
2076,911 and the perils of official forgetting when two planes flew into the world trade center in new york and another plowed into the pentagon on september 11 2001 they hit a country which lacked the kind of shared memory of trauma that existed in spain and argentina
2077,that’s not to say us history is unmarked by repeated traumas
2078,the united states was founded in domestic state terror from the genocide of indigenous peoples to slavery through to lynching and mass incarceration trauma has been everpresent right up to this day
2079,moreover very frequently shocks and crises have been handmaidens to the worst abuses
2080,in the aftermath of the civil war the promise of land redistribution as economic reparation to freed slaves was promptly betrayed
2081,the financial crisis of 1873 known as the great panic further entrenched the excuse that the economy was too ravaged and the country too dividedand instead of reparations came a reign of terror against freed slaves in the south
2082,during the great depression amidst economic panic as many as two million mexicans and mexican americans were expelled
2083,after the attacks on pearl harbor approximately 120000 japanese americans twothirds of whom had been born in the united states were incarcerated in internment camps just as in canada almost the entire japanesecanadian citizenry was rounded up and forcibly interned
2084,so the problem after 911 was not that the united states had no experience of how shocking events can be harnessed to attack democracy and human rights
2085,the problem rather was that these past traumatic events while very well understood within the communities impacted were insufficiently understood more broadly they are not part of a shared national narrative that could have helped all americans see the difference between reasonable security measures and leaders taking advantage of fear to advance opportunistic agendas
2086,that’s why the bush administration was able to mercilessly exploit the shock of the september 11 trauma to attack civil liberties at home and launch wars abroad which we now know were justified through doctored intelligence
2087,that’s why the neglect and violence of the state during and after katrina came as no great surprise to the city’s africanamerican residentsyet seemed unprecedented to so many white americans
2088,the split between people who were stunned by trump’s victory and those who saw it coming followed similar racial fault lines
2089,shock resistance in the usa but one thing that’s become clear since trump took office is that the memory of how terror was exploited after september 11 lives on
2090,though trump and his supporters have tried their best to use fearof muslims of mexicans of violent “ghettos”to control and divide the population the tactic has backfired repeatedly
2091,since trump’s election countless people have participated in political actions and gatherings for the first time in their lives and have rushed to show solidarity with people who have been cast as the “other” it began on day one of the new administration
2092,at trump’s inauguration small groups representing different movementsfrom climate justice to black lives matteroccupied various street intersections to block access to the ceremony
2093,then the next day came the women’s marches with some six hundred cities participating this appears to have been the largest coordinated protest in us history with an estimated 42 million people on the streets
2094,and though large women’s organizations and established activists helped with the organizing and logistics the original idea came from a retired attorney and grandmother in hawaii who said to a few dozen friends on facebook “i think we should march” i marched in dc with family and friends and was struck by the fact that though women were in the majority tens of thousands of men had shown up as well standing up to defend the rights of their partners mothers sisters daughters and friends
2095,and while some may have initially thought they were marching only to defend a woman’s right to make decisions over her own body as well as for pay equity they soon discovered that in this new era women’s rights are far more expansive including black women’s right to be free from police violence and immigrant women’s right to be free from fear of deportation and trans women’s right to be free from hate and harassment
2096,as the mission statement declared “this march is the first step towards unifying our communities grounded in new relationships to create change from the grassroots level up” this same spirit of unity has been on display when specific communities have been targeted by the administration or by the wave of hate crimes it has helped unleash
2097,the new activism was most visible after trump issued the first of his muslim travel bans and tens of thousands of peopleof all faiths and nonetook to the streets and airports to declare “we are all muslims” and “let them in” one of the countries included in the travel ban was yemen
2098,in new york yemeniamerican familieswho own many of the city’s ubiquitous corner stores known locally as “bodegas”organized swiftly
2099,this is not a community known for being politically active nor is it one that is represented by big organizations or unions
2100,and yet in a matter of days the city saw its first “bodega strike” with over a thousand businesses closing down and some shopkeepers holding outdoor muslim prayers
2101,thousands of their family members friends and customers came out to support them
2102,faith groups have been particularly active in pushing back against the divideandconquer tactics
2103,when jewish cemeteries in st louis and philadelphia were vandalized for instance islamic organizations raised more than 160000eight times their initial goalto help pay for the repairs
2104,and when a white nationalist opened fire in a mosque in quebec city in january 2017 killing six people and injuring nineteen the response in the province and across canada was powerful including dozens of memorials and vigils many of them outside mosquesfrom vancouver to toronto to iqaluit
2105,small acts too can assert our common humanity in an atmosphere of fear and division
2106,trump supporters launched a vicious online campaign to smear linda sarsour a palestinian american who was one of the organizers of the women’s march on washington as a closet supporter of terrorism and an antisemite
2107,such false claims were precisely the kind of attacks that ruined lives and careers after september 11 but this time it didn’t workan istandwithlinda countercampaign rose up almost instantly so loud and large that it all but buried the smears
2108,and when immigration officers arrested 24 yearold daniel ramirez medinawho had come to the usa from mexico with his parents as a childorganizers launched a successful campaign for his release freeing him from a washington state detention center after more than six weeks in custody
2109,on a larger scale hundreds of cities and counties joined by schools campuses churches and restaurants have stepped forward to declare themselves “sanctuaries” for immigrants the trump administration would seek to deport
2110,the sanctuary movement which began well before the 2016 elections is inspired by the belief that by coming together communities can try to prevent deportations from taking place on their watch
2111,but as many have pointed out this often does not prevent police and border officials from conducting raids and breaking up families
2112,that’s why the american civil liberties union which raised nearly 80 million through online donations in the first three months after election day has been coordinating a campaign to pressure state and city governments to adopt a set of nine basic policies aimed at protecting immigrants from trump’s agenda
2113,within a month over a thousand communities had already started to push their local law enforcement agencies to make these commitments
2114,there have been criticisms it should be noted that these demands do not go far enough
2115,there have also been many actions designed to highlight the interdependence that exists between citizens and immigrants which mounting xenophobia seeks to deny
2116,in february 2017 workers across sectors and cities participated in a day without immigrants highlighting how dependent the american economy is on the people trump is trying to kick out
2117,as one organizer of the day’s events told a reporter “we want to make sure that people understand that this city would stop functioning if we weren’t there to build or cook or clean”  after twelve restaurant workers in oklahoma were fired for participating in the demonstration at least two nearby restaurants immediately offered to hire them
2118,the revenge of reality another hallmark of the trump era is the war on facts not only has the press been cast as an enemy of the people but scientific information has disappeared from government websites and there has been a de facto ban on talking about climate change through official government communications channels
2119,in response several creative initiatives have emerged to defend objective reality
2120,days after the inauguration the badlands national park twitter account was the first to defect from the administration’s clampdown on science tweeting out facts about ocean acidification and the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
2121,the posts were taken down shortly after they were issued but not before sparking a trend of rogue twitter accounts
2122,with key scientific research mysteriously disappearing from government websites there’s been a concerted international effort to save it from the memory hole
2123,shortly after trump’s win the internet archive a san francisco–based nonprofit digital library which for the last two decades has dedicated itself to preserving web content for the public and already has hundreds of billions of webpages archived announced plans to find a backup server in canada to preserve us data
2124,in the days before trump’s inauguration “data rescue” events were held in several cities as researchers and concerned volunteers met to back up data sets from the epa and other government websites
2125,and in february 2017 a “hackathon” at uc berkeley drew two hundred data defenders to help save the knowledge generated by public institutions such as the department of energy and nasa ’ s earth sciences programs
2126,scientists are often wary of engaging in political activism since advocacy on the same issue you are researching can be seized upon as evidence of bias
2127,it’s an understandable caution but faced with the trump administration’s open attacks on scientific reality and bald attempts to suppress inconvenient research many scientists have concluded they have to take a stand
2128,jane goodall the famed primatologist has described the attacks on science as “a trumpet call” to the scientific community
2129,which is why on earth day 2017 tens of thousands of scientists participated in the march for science in washington while upwards of forty thousand joined science marches in chicago and los angeles and these were just the largest of more than six hundred marches held across the usa and in sixtyeight other countries
2130,“if we cannot discuss facts openly” one stanford biologist told the guardian  “how can democracy based on public discussions and trust in our societal truths survive
2131,and so we will march” one chant that made the rounds “what do we want
2132,evidencebased research
2133,when do we want it
2134,after peer review” just one week later hundreds of thousands of us converged in the blistering heat in washington once again with hundreds of satellite marches elsewhere coming together under a banner of “climate jobs and justice” this time the demand was not just for science to be respected but for it to form the basis of a bold and urgent economic and social transformation
2135, what has stood out in this wave of early resistance is how the barriers defining who is and who is not an “activist” or an “organizer” are completely breaking down
2136,people are organizing mass events who have never organized anything political before
2137,a great many are discovering that whatever their field of expertise whether they are lawyers or restaurant workers they have crucial skills to share in this emerging network of resistance
2138,and wherever they live or work whether it’s a laboratory or a bodega or a law firm or inside the home they have the power if they organize with others to throw a wrench into a dangerous system
2139,at the same time many of us are realizing that if we’re going to rise to the urgency and magnitude of this moment we need skills and knowledge that we currently lackabout history about how to change the political system and even about how to change ourselves
2140,so in addition to the highly visible campaigns and demonstrations there has also been a surge of popular education
2141,for many a first step is relearning how democracy works
2142,when harvard graduate students announced an online and inperson “resistance school” meant to equip fledgling organizers with “the tools we need to fight back at the federal state and local levels” over fifty thousand peoplecoming from all fifty statessigned up
2143,in the days following trump’s election a handful of former democratic congressional staffers drafted a twentyfourpage google document distilling lessons learned from seeing the tea party challenge obama’s agenda district by district
2144,they called it the indivisible guide
2145,in trump’s first hundred days over seven thousand “indivisible” chapters were formedmost consisting not of hardened activists but of schoolteachers and retirees furious that their elected representatives were helping further trump’s agenda
2146,more than a straightforward howto manual for bottomup democracy the indivisible guide and the activism that sprang out of it have offered as one virginiabased indivisible recruit and firsttime organizer put it “not just a political community but a community that cares for you where what’s bringing you together is this shared sense of civic responsibility toward this system that’s going off the rails” there is also a growing desire among white people to do more to challenge racial biases in ourselves our communities and our families
2147,groups like showing up for racial justice have seen interest in their trainings and workshops surge
2148,the arab american association of new york and other groups are hosting reliably packed trainings on how to effectively intervene in hate crimes and racist harassment
2149,meanwhile as the administration prepared the ground for slashing funding to women’s shelters family planning and violenceagainst women programs grassroots fundraising efforts took off in response
2150,planned parenthood reported an astonishing 260000 donors in the month after the election with nearly a quarter of the contributions coming in the name of mike pence during the election campaign the vice president had said he wanted the landmark prochoice roe v wade supreme court decision sent “to the ash heap of history”
2151,all of these acts of solidarity and expressions of unity reflect the fact that after decades of “siloed” politics more and more people understand that we can only beat trumpism in cooperation with one anotherno one movement can win on its own
2152,the trick is going to be to stick together and have each other’s backs as never before
2153,that’s why over fifty progressive groups drawn from a dizzying array of struggles greeted the start of trump’s cabinet hearings with a declaration of “united resistance”publicly pledging “to take action to support one another to be accountable to one another and to act together in solidarity whether in the streets in the halls of power or in our communities every day
2154,when they come for one they come for us all” nor can we afford to restrict our vision to any one sphere
2155,as angela davis put it concluding a rousing speech at the women’s march on washington “the next 1459 days of the trump administration will be 1459 days of resistance resistance on the ground resistance in the classrooms resistance on the job resistance in our art and in our music
2156,this is just the beginning and in the words of the inimitable ella baker ‘we who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes’ ”  the refusal to be bullied by trump reaches beyond us borders across the north american continent
2157,when the muslim travel ban was announced thousands of canadians led by muslim and immigrant rights groups immediately sprang into action demanding that canada provide safe haven to the migrants and refugees being denied entry to the usa
2158,there’s also a burgeoning support movement to welcome the growing numbers of immigrants fleeing the states and crossing into canada by foot even in subzero weather with horrifying stories of fingers and toes lost to frostbite
2159,canadian refugee law currently treats the united states as a “safe” country and therefore not a legitimate point from which to flee and seek asylum in canada
2160,but many are now putting pressure on the canadian governmentthrough petitions and demonstrationsto change those rules
2161,as a letter from a group of law professors pointed out trump’s actions “reflect the very bigotry xenophobia and nativist fearmongering that the international refugee regime was designed to counteract” in mexico meanwhile tens of thousands of people across more than a dozen cities have protested trump’s immigration policies as well as his antimexican ethnic smears
2162,outside north america the pressure is on too
2163,in the uk nearly two million people signed an official petition to block trump from making a state visit to britain trump reportedly is demanding a ride in the golden royal carriage
2164,there is also a growing international movement calling on governments to impose trade sanctions on the united states for violating the emissions reduction pledges it made under the paris climate accord
2165,and the movement to jam the trump brand is growing including a global call to boycott companies that rent space in trump’s various towers as well as campaigns to push developers to drop the trump name from cities’ skylines
2166,and around the world nearly every country has its own white nationalist or neofascist movement to confront and there are many signs that resistance is rising
2167,in response to the antiimmigrant backlash in europe huge demonstrations have been held in cities across the continentfrom berlin to helsinkito insist that migrants are welcome
2168,in barcelona more than 100000 people heeded a call from their new mayor a former housing rights activist and marched through the streets under the banner “ volem acollir ” we welcome them
2169,many grassroots organizations have sprung up to provide direct aid where governments have failed
2170,when large numbers of migrants began arriving in greece in 2015 they encountered a people who had “endured five years of austerity shock treatment who had seen their lives degraded and their social political and labor rights vanishing” writes sociologist theodoros karyotis
2171,and yet rather than jealously guard what little they had left locals met migrants with an “outpouring of solidarity” thousands of greeks opened their homes to refugees millions of homecooked meals were delivered to refugee camps free health care was provided in communityrun clinics and a warehouse in a workerrun factory was opened to collect donated items such as clothes and baby food
2172,in germany as proposals surfaced that migrants be housed in dodgy conditions that included school gyms vacant office buildings empty warehouses army barracks and even a former nazi forced labor camp people organized an “airbnb for refugees” matching migrant families in need of a safe place to stay with spare rooms in local houses
2173,the effort has now spread to thirteen other countries
2174,my country is home to a remarkable prorefugee movement that has seen thousands of canadians sponsor syrian families taking financial and interpersonal responsibility for the newcomers’ needs for one year as they adjusted to a new language culture and climate
2175,the new york times described it as “the world’s most personal resettlement program” most encouragingly while the early assumption was that trump’s rise could set off a wave of farright electoral victories in some countries it seems to be having the opposite effect
2176,witnessing trump’s ugly administration in action some electorates are deciding to stop the tide
2177,ahead of elections in the netherlands in march 2017 many predicted a win for geert wilders and his profoundly anti islamic and xenophobic freedom party
2178,instead wilders’s support suddenly collapsed and the governing party held on to the most seats
2179,but the biggest winner in the election was the greenleft party which went from holding four seats to capturing fourteen
2180,the party’s leader jesse klaver is of moroccan and indonesian descent and campaigned with a bold antiracist message
2181,on election day klaver had advice for other politicians in europe facing resurgent rightwing populism and racism “don’t try to fake the populace
2182,stand for your principles
2183,be straight
2184,be prorefugee
2185,be proeuropean
2186,you can stop populism”  it’s a piece of advice that many heeded in france a couple of months later though ultimately not enough
2187,faced with the threat of a victory for the far right’s marine le pen many withdrew their support from centrist candidates fearing a repeat of clinton vs trump and lent it instead to the left populist candidate jeanluc mélenchon
2188,he had campaigned on an anti–free trade propeace and radical economic redistribution agenda and started attracting crowds as large as seventy thousand more than any other candidate
2189,against all odds mélenchon who was initially reported to have the support of just 9 percent of votersmanaged to capture 196 percent of votes cast in the first ballot putting him within just 2 percentage points of making it to the final runoff
2190,in the final vote emmanuel macron a neoliberal former banker trounced marine le pen though her extremist party still received a record number of votes
2191,and roughly onethird of eligible voters chose to express their displeasure with both le pen and macron by either abstaining or spoiling their ballots
2192,in spain meanwhile candidates with deep roots in social movements have won mayoralty races in barcelona and madrid and have begun introducing concrete policies that welcome refugees battle homelessness and fight pollution at the same time
2193,will solidarity survive a major shock
2194,these reactions are a vast improvement over the far too successful post–september 11 divideandconquer politics
2195,so far trump’s shock tactics aren’t disorienting the opposition
2196,instead they are waking people up in the united states and around the world
2197,but of course the new alliances in the us have not yet had to face a major security crisis or a state of emergency
2198,the real test will be whether the bravery and solidarity seen so far can be sustained when people are being told they are in imminent danger and that the group they’re expressing solidarity with could be harboring the individual who set off a bomb last week
2199,nevertheless there is reason to believe that many of the relationships being built in these early days will be strong enough to counter the fear that inevitably sets in during a state of emergency
2200,if trump tries to use a crisis event to ram through draconian measures this emerging resistance is poised to rise up and act as a human barrier to say “nonot this time” chapter eleven when no was not enough here’s the trouble
2201,just saying no to shock tactics is often not enough to stop them at least not on its own
2202,it’s a lesson i learned the year after the shock doctrine came out when wall street suffered its worst crisis since the great crash of 1929 we saw how the 2008 financial crisisthe clear result of unchecked greed in the financial sectorwas exploited all around the world but particularly in southern europe to extract punishing shock doctrine– style concessions from regular people
2203,europeans resisted these cynical tactics with incredible tenacity and courage well beyond anything seen so far in the united states under trump
2204,they occupied squares and plazas and stayed for months
2205,they staged general strikes that shut down cities and in some cases even voted to throw the bastards out
2206,outside europe in tunisia it was a sudden rise in food prices that became the catalyst for the wave of uprisings that came to be called the arab spring
2207,one of the street slogans in this period which originated in italy before spreading to greece and spain was “we will not pay for your crisis” millions of people understood that this was what was being asked of them
2208,they were getting stuck with the bankers’ bills forced to pay for their sins with a higher cost of living and lower wages
2209,and they said no
2210,loudly unmistakably and in tremendous numbers
2211,but in the vast majority of cases it wasn’t enoughthe economic punishments kept coming
2212,at times a particularly egregious austerity measure might be successfully fought back with street protests
2213,quebec students fought off a tuition increase in 2012 much as chilean students fought for an overhaul of their broken education system in 2011 but the austerity agenda ground on
2214,more importantly this wave of protest and occupations did not produce a fundamental change in the economic model one that could shift us off the road headed toward that world of green zones and red zones
2215,when the failures of our current model revealed themselves in a manner more spectacular than at any point since the great depression we did not collectively seize that moment to grab the wheel of history and swerve
2216,the responsibility for that is collective
2217,no one person or political party is to blame for the roads not taken
2218,but the failures in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash were starkest in the united states because of the remarkable number of factors that seemed aligned in favor of transformative rather than incremental change
2219,which is why it’s worth revisiting that moment of crisis in some depth not to point fingers but to understand what it looks like to miss such a rare political openingso we don’t repeat those mistakes when the next economic shock hits
2220,let’s cast our minds back to the beginning of 2009 barack obama was entering the white house as the first africanamerican president a decisive rebuke to eight years of bush
2221,he had easily carried the popular vote and for the next two years his fellow democrats would control congress
2222,obama also had a clear democratic mandate to do more than tinker with the shattered economy
2223,in the final three months before he took office the country had lost almost two million jobs and the picture going into 2009 looked grim
2224,the idea of taking on wall street was incredibly popular it still is because the big financial institutions that had tanked the global economy were the reason so many people had lost their homes and jobs and seen their life savings evaporate
2225,the banks had no defenderstheir executives were virtually in hiding
2226,on the campaign trail obama had talked forcefully about how he would rebuild the economy in favor of “the hard work and sacrifice of folks on main street” while standing up to “the greed and irresponsibility of wall street” the new administration had a mandate to battle the climate crisis too
2227,after eight years of denial and obstructionism under george w bush obama had pledged to put a price on carbon and to create five million green jobs by making major investments including in renewable energy and hybrid cars
2228,when obama won the democratic primary he told the cheering crowd that this would be remembered as the moment the rise of the oceans began to slow and “the planet began to heal” yes he was weak on the details but this was no ordinary election and there is no question that the democratic mandate for boldness was there
2229,when the banks were on their knees looking back it’s really striking how much economic power obama and the democrats had in that short window before they lost congress
2230,first they had a free hand to design a stimulus program to rebuild main streetand to make it as big as required
2231,after decades of unrelenting cutbacks in social spending there was suddenly a widespread consensus on the need for the federal government to pull the economy out of recession
2232,the stimulus plan ended up being 800 billion a staggering sum although at the time it was widely criticized for being too small
2233,and that was not the only tool that obama had to make good on his promises to rebuild main street
2234,the banks were on their knees receiving trillions of dollars in public money in direct bailouts and loan guarantees and there were very lively and heated debates going on in the united states and around the world about what governments should demand in exchange for saving the banks from the consequences of their own greed
2235,should they cap executive salaries
2236,restore glass–steagall the depressionera law that separated commercial and investment banks
2237,should they throw the ceos responsible for the global crisis in jail
2238,should the banks be permanently nationalized and run as public trusts
2239,some of this may sound radical today but it’s worth remembering that these were the actual debates going on in 2009 even in staid publications like the financial times 
2240,and there were similar discussions about the fate of the big auto companies which were also heading to washington needing bailouts
2241,two of the big threegeneral motors and chrysler had to declare bankruptcy that same year and were put under government control
2242,so let’s zoom out and imagine what might have been
2243,obama had the electoral mandate for real change he had a virtual blank check to design a stimulus package and he had an opportunity to impose muchneeded changes on two failing sectors of the us economythe banks and the auto companies
2244,imagine if the democrats had used the leverage they had in 2009 and 2010 to make serious substantive restructuring demands of the banks and the auto giants in exchange for continuing to bail them out
2245,imagine if obama who had been elected on a promise to rebuild main street solve climate change and stabilize the economy had treated the banking and automotive sectors as components of a unified vision for reviving the economy while fighting inequality and climate change at the same time
2246,to be concrete what if the auto companies had been mandated to restructure themselves so they were producing the vehicles of the low carbon futureelectric cars electric buses and light rail
2247,in the midst of the financial crisis two million manufacturing jobs were lost and hundreds of factories closed down
2248,what if instead of letting that happen those factories had been refurbished and retooled
2249,a similar industrial transformation took place during world war ii when us factories were enlisted for the war effort
2250,it would have been expensive yes but the banks could have been required to spend a healthy portion of their bailout money providing the necessary loans for this industrial transformation as it was they hoarded the cash
2251,and stimulus money could have been spent to help workers get the training they needed to fully participate in the transition building the public infrastructuretransit energy gridsof this same green economy
2252,obama’s infrastructure bill did include important support for green energy and green projects but the clean infrastructure of the future including public transit and light rail was shortchanged in favor of the dirty infrastructure of the past such as highways
2253,and the opportunities presented by the bank and auto bailouts were squandered almost completely
2254,even after all their failures the attitude in washington was still the banks know best the auto companies know best our job is just to get these industries on their feet as quickly as possible so they can get back to a gently tweaked version of business as usual
2255,the jobs revolution that wasn’t this road not taken matters because right now one of the biggest obstacles to serious action on climate change is the fossil fuel companies’ successful positioning of themselves as the only ones capable of creating wellpaying jobs and keeping the lights on
2256,obama and the democrats could have buried that claim once and for all
2257,other countries in the same period did bury the claim
2258,over the past decade the german government has treated the green economy as the main way to revive its manufacturing sector
2259,in the process it has created 400000 jobs and now 30 percent of the country’s energy comes from renewables
2260,and germany has the strongest economy in europe by far
2261,the energy transition there is incompletegermany remains excessively reliant on coaland its government has inflicted merciless austerity on other countries while choosing another course for itself
2262,but if the us had followed germany’s domestic example it would have been so far along the road to a renewablesbased economy that it would have been impossible for trump to undono matter how many executive orders he signed
2263,and who knows
2264,the new manufacturing jobs and improved infrastructure might well have been enough to deprive him of his win altogether
2265,granted all of this change and restructuring would have demanded uncommon focus and toughness
2266,if obama had taken a transformative approach to the failed banks and auto companies and to the reckless energy sector when he came into office the backlash would have been ferocious and difficult to bear
2267,he would have been painted as a communist the us’s own hugo chávez
2268,on the other hand his mandate for widespread change along with the outpouring of goodwill that greeted his election was accompanied by such rare economic powers that it could well have ushered in a new era of economic fairness and climate stability
2269,the fact that this moment passed americans by is not a failure that can be pinned on the democrats alone
2270,during obama’s first years in office most progressive organizationsrelieved to finally be rid of bush and flattered to have the ear of the governing party for the first time in a decadeconfused access with power
2271,as a result the kind of outside pressure that has leveraged major policy victories in the past was largely mia during obama’s first term
2272,despite some valiant attempts there was no united progressive coalition pressuring obama to make more of his unique moment in history pushing him to deliver big on jobs racial justice clean air clean water and better services
2273,that was a mistake
2274,as the great and muchmissed historian howard zinn once wrote “the really critical thing isn’t who is sitting in the white house but who is sitting inin the streets in the cafeterias in the halls of government in the factories
2275,who is protesting who is occupying offices and demonstrating
2276,those are the things that determine what happens” the bottom line is that in 2009 as theorists and organizers we weren’t readytoo many of us were waiting for change to be delivered from on high
2277,and by the time most of us realized how inadequate that change was the window had closed and the tea party was already on the rise
2278,remembering when we leapt before shock doctrine politics became the norm in the eighties crises that were obviously born of financial greed and corporate malfeasance often sparked very different responses
2279,in fact they provoked some of the most momentous progressive victories in modern history
2280,in the united states after the carnage of the civil war and the abolition of slavery blacks and their radical allies pushed for economic justice and greater social rights
2281,they won major victories including free public education for all childrenalthough it would take another century before schools were desegregated
2282,the horrific 1911 fire at the triangle shirtwaist company in new york city which took the lives of 146 young immigrant garment workers catalyzed hundreds of thousands of workers into militancy eventually leading to an overhaul of the state labor code caps on overtime new rules for child labor and breakthroughs in health and fire safety regulations
2283,most significantly it was only thanks to the collective response from below to the great crash of 1929 that the new deal became possible
2284,the strike wave of the mid1930sthe teamsters’ rebellion and minneapolis general strike the 83day shutdown of the west coast by longshore workers and the flint sitdown strikes in the auto plants established the power of industrial unions and forced owners to share a great deal more wealth with their workers
2285,in this same period as a response to the suffering brought on by the great depression mass movements demanded sweeping social programs such as social security and unemployment insurance programs from which the majority of africanamerican and many women workers were notably excluded
2286,in the same period tough new rules regulating the financial sector were introduced at real cost to unfettered profit making
2287,across the industrialized world pressure from social movements created the conditions for programs like the new deal featuring ambitious investments in public infrastructureutilities transportation systems housing and moreon a scale comparable to what the climate crisis calls for today
2288,just as the wreckage of the second world war provided another such catalyst
2289,in 1969 there was an oil spill in santa barbara which coated california’s beautiful beaches and it was something like a great crash for the environmenta shock millions responded to by demanding fundamental change
2290,many of north america’s toughest laws protecting air water and endangered species can trace their roots back to the popular anger that exploded in response to that disaster
2291,in all these cases a painful crisis served as a wakeup call ushering in meaningful legislation that created a fairer and safer society thanks in no small part to the hard work of organizers who had been preparing the ground for years before the shocks hit
2292,these were far from perfect reforms not fullscale transformations and yet they were directly responsible for winning much of the modern social safety net as well as the regulatory structures that protect so many workers and public health
2293,moreover winning them did not require authoritarian trickery
2294,they were so popular with voters that they didn’t have to be snuck in under cover of crisis but rather were loudly demanded by muscular social movementsa deepening of democracy not its subversion
2295,so why did those crises produce such visionary change while more recent oneskatrina the subprime mortgage debacle bp’s deepwater horizon disasterhave left so little progressive public policy behind
2296,when utopia lends a hand here is one theory the interplay between lofty dreams and earthly victories has always been at the heart of moments of deep transformation
2297,the breakthroughs won for workers and their families after the civil war and during the great depression as well as for civil rights and the environment in the sixties and early seventies were not just responses to crises
2298,they were responses to crises that unfolded in times when people dared to dream big  out loud in public explosions of utopian imagination
2299,the gilded age strikers of the late nineteenth century enraged by the enormous fortunes being amassed off the backs of repressed laborers were inspired by the paris commune when the working people of paris took over the governing of their city for months
2300,they dreamed of a “cooperative commonwealth” a world where work was but one element of a wellbalanced life with plenty of time for leisure family and art
2301,utopian socialist fiction including edward bellamy’s looking backward  topped the bestseller lists in sharp contrast to today when it is classic dystopian fictiongeorge orwell’s 1984  margaret atwood’s the handmaid’s tale  and sinclair lewis’s it can’t happen here that has reappeared on bestseller lists since trump’s inauguration
2302,workingclass organizers in the great depression were versed not only in marx but also in web
2303,du bois whose vision was of a pan–working class movement that could unite the downtrodden to transform an unjust economic system
2304,as historian robin dg
2305,kelley has written the end of the nineteenth century was a period of foment for “blackled biracial democratic populist and radical movements” the same is true of the hardwon victories of the civil rights era
2306,it was the movement’s transcendent dreamwhether articulated in the oratory of martin luther king jr or in the vision of the student nonviolent coordinating committeethat created the space for and inspired the grassroots organizing that in turn led to tangible wins
2307,a similar utopian fervor in the late sixties and early seventiesemerging out of the countercultural upheaval when young people were questioning just about everythinglaid the groundwork for feminist lesbian and gay and environmental breakthroughs
2308,the new deal it is always worth remembering was adopted by president roosevelt at a time of such progressive and left militancy that its programsradical by today’s standardsappeared at the time to be the only way to prevent fullscale revolution
2309,and this was no idle threat
2310,when upton sinclair the muckraking author of the jungle  ran for governor of california in 1934 it was something like the bernie sanders campaign of its day
2311,sinclair was a champion of a more left wing version of the new deal arguing that the key to ending poverty was full state funding of workers’ cooperatives
2312,he received nearly 900000 votes but fell short of winning the governor’s office
2313,if you didn’t learn this in history class it may not be a coincidence
2314,as the czech novelist milan kundera famously observed “the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting” trapped in the matrix by the time the 2008 financial fiasco was unfolding that utopian imagination had largely atrophied
2315,a great many people knew that the appropriate response to the crisis was moral outrage that gifting the banks with trillions refusing to prosecute those responsible and asking the poor and elderly to pay the steepest costs was an obscenity
2316,yet generations who had grown up under neoliberalism struggled to picture something anything other than what they had always known
2317,this may also have something to do with the power of memory
2318,when workers rose up against the depravities of the industrial age many had living memories of a different kind of economy
2319,others were actively fighting to protect an existing way of life whether it was the family farm that was being lost to predatory creditors or smallscale artisanal businesses being wiped out by industrial capitalism
2320,having known something different they were capable of imaginingand fighting for a radically better future
2321,even those who have never known anything but enslavement and apartheid have been endlessly creative in finding waysoften through clandestine art formsto nurture and keep alive the dream of freedom selfgovernment and democracy
2322,as the pulitzer prize–winning novelist junot díaz observed shortly after the 2016 election forecasting the hard times ahead those of us whose ancestors were owned and bred like animals know that future all too well because it is in part our past
2323,and we know that by fighting against all odds we who had nothing not even our real names transformed the universe
2324,our ancestors did this with very little and we who have more must do the same
2325,it is this imaginative capacity the ability to envision a world radically different from the present that has been largely missing since the cry of no first began echoing around the world in 2008 in the west there is little popular memory of any other kind of economic system
2326,there are specific cultures and communitiesmost notably indigenous communitiesthat have vigilantly kept alive memories and models of other ways to live not based on ownership of the land and endless extraction of profit
2327,but most of us who are outside those traditions find ourselves fully within capitalism’s matrixso while we can demand slight improvements to our current conditions imagining something else entirely is distinctly more difficult
2328,which is partially why the movements that did emergefrom europe’s “movement of the squares” to occupy wall street and even egypt’s revolutionwere very clear on their “no” no to the greed of the bankers no to austerity and in egypt no to dictatorship
2329,but what was too often missing was a clear and captivating vision of the world beyond that no
2330,and in its absence the shocks kept coming
2331,with unleashed white supremacy and misogyny with the world teetering on the edge of ecological collapse with the very last vestiges of the public sphere set to be devoured by capital it’s clear that we need to do more than draw a line in the sand and say “no more” yes we need to do that and we need to chart a credible and inspiring path to a different future
2332,and that future cannot simply be where we were before trump came along aka the world that gave us trump
2333,it has to be somewhere we have never been before
2334,picturing that place requires a reclaiming of the utopian tradition that animated so many transcendent social movements in the past
2335,it means having the courage to paint a picture of a different world one which even if it exists only in our minds can fuel us as we engage in winnable battles
2336,because as oscar wilde wrote in 1891 “a map of the world that does not include utopia is not worth even glancing at for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always landing
2337,and when humanity lands there it looks out and seeing a better country sets sail” part of that voyage is not just talking and writing about the future we wantbut building it as we go
2338,it’s a principle i saw in action and prayer and song in standing rock
2339,chapter twelve lessons from standing rock daring to dream less than a month after trump was elected i went to standing rock north dakota
2340,the forecast called for an epic snowstorm and it was already starting to come down as we arrived the low hills and heavy sky a monochromatic white
2341,days earlier the governor had announced plans to clear the camps of the thousands of “water protectors” who had gathered on the outskirts of the standing rock sioux reservation to try to stop the dakota access pipeline
2342,the company was determined to build the oil pipeline under lake oahe the sole source of drinking water for the standing rock sioux as well as under another section of the missouri river which provides drinking water for 17 million people
2343,if the pipeline ruptured the tribal leaders argued their people would have no safe water and their sacred sites would be desecrated
2344,the movement’s lakotalanguage slogan heard around the world was mni wiconi “water is life” after months of confrontations with private security and highly militarized police it seemed the governor now felt with trump on the way to the white house that the coast was clear to crush the movement with force
2345,the blows had been coming for monthsabout 750 people would be arrested by the time the camps were clearedand when i arrived standing rock had already become the site of the most violent state repression in recent us history
2346,with the issuing of the eviction order many were calling december 5 2016 the standing rock sioux’s “last stand” and i along with many others had traveled there to stand with them
2347,in a surprise development a convoy of more than two thousand military veterans had also come to standing rock to stand with the sioux prepared to face off against their fellow uniformed officers if need be
2348,the veterans said they had taken an oath “to serve and protect” the constitution
2349,and after seeing footage of peaceful indigenous water protectors being brutally attacked by security dogs blasted with water cannons in subzero temperatures and fired on with rubber bullets pepper spray and beanbag rounds these vets had decided that the duty to protect now required that they stand up to the government which had once sent them to war
2350,by the time i arrived the network of camps had swelled to roughly ten thousand people living in hundreds upon hundreds of tents tepees and yurts
2351,dozens of kids were sledding down a snowy hill
2352,the main camp was a hive of calm nonstop activity
2353,volunteer cooks served meals to thousands trucks arriving with fresh ingredients all day
2354,young mediamakers worldfamous musicians and hollywood actors were filing continuous dispatches about the latest developments exposing their huge followings to the drama of the standoff
2355,seminars on decolonization and nonviolence were happening in the larger tents and a geodesic dome
2356,a group of drummers was gathered around the sacred fire tending to the flames so they were never extinguished
2357,down the road the newly arrived vets were setting up camp with impressive speed employing skills honed on the battlefields of afghanistan iraq and for a few vietnam
2358,it struck me that the last time i had spent this much time with us military personnel was in baghdad where young men and women in these same uniforms were sent in to occupy a country that just so happened to have one of the world’s largest reserves of crude oil
2359,after all the times american soldiers have been called upon to protect oil and gas wealth and to wage war on indigenous people at home and abroad it was unbearably moving to see these soldiers show up voluntarily and unarmed to join an indigenousled fight to stop yet another waterpoisoning climate destabilizing fossil fuel project
2360,one of my first conversations at standing rock was with legendary lakota elder ladonna brave bull allard who in many ways had got all this resistance going when she opened the first camp on her land the sacred stone camp
2361,that was in april 2016 eight months later here she was eyes still sparkling betraying not a bit of fatigue despite playing den mother to thousands of people who had come from across the world to be part of this historic movement
2362,she told me that the camp had become a home and a community to hundreds and then thousands
2363,it had also become a field hospitalfor those injured by the police attacks and also those psychically frightened by what trump’s rise was already unleashing
2364,learning by living brave bull allard who is the official historian of the standing rock sioux tribe said that most of all the encampment had become a schoolfor indigenous youth seeking to connect more deeply with their own culture to live on the land and in ceremony and also for nonindigenous people who realized that the moment called for skills and knowledge most of us don’t have
2365,“my grandkids can’t believe how little some of the white people know” she told me laughing but without judgment
2366,“they come running ‘grandma
2367,the white people don’t know how to chop wood
2368,can we teach them’ i say ‘yes teach them’ ” brave bull allard herself patiently taught hundreds of visitors what she considered basic survival skills how to use sage as a natural disinfectant how to stay warm and dry in north dakota’s vicious storms “everyone needs at least six tarps” she declared sternly
2369,she told me she had come to understand that although stopping the pipeline was crucial there was something greater at work in this convergence
2370,she said the camps were now a place where indigenous and nonindigenous people alike were learning to live in relationship and community with the land
2371,and for her it was not just the hard skills that mattered
2372,this moment was also about exposing visitors to the traditions and ceremonies that had been kept alive despite hundreds of years of genocidal attacks on indigenous people and culture
2373,this she told me is why the traditions survived the onslaught
2374,“we knew this day was comingthe unification of all the tribeswe are here to protect the earth and the water
2375,this is why we are still alive
2376,to do this very thing we are doing
2377,to help humanity answer its most pressing question how do we live with the earth again not against it” and this teaching needs to happen fast she saidclimate disruption is kicking in
2378,if nonindigenous people don’t start to learn how to take care of earth’s lifesustaining systems then we are all cooked
2379,with this in mind brave bull allard saw the camps as just the beginning
2380,after the pipeline was defeated she said the standing rock sioux needed to turn themselves into a model for green energy and sustainable living
2381,this vision of a movement not just resisting but modeling and teaching the way forward is shared by many of the movement’s key figures including standing rock sioux tribal council member cody two bears
2382,dressed in a red sweatshirt with the word warrior emblazoned in black letters he talked about the early days of european presence on these lands when his ancestors educated the visitors on how to survive in a harsh and unfamiliar climate
2383,“we taught them how to grow food keep warm build longhouses” but the taking never ended from the earth and from indigenous people
2384,and now two bears says “things are getting worse
2385,so the first people of this land have to teach this country how to live again
2386,by going green by going renewable by using the blessings the creator has given us the sun and the wind
2387,we are going to start in native country
2388,and we’re going to show the rest of the country how to live” age of the protectors at standing rock i found myself thinking a lot about what it means to be a protector
2389,leaders of the movement here had insisted from day one that they were not “protesters” out to make trouble but “water protectors” determined to stop a whole other order of trouble
2390,and then there were all the vets in tshirts that said to serve and protect  deciding that living up to that oath meant putting themselves on the front line to protect the rights of the continent’s first peoples
2391,and i thought about my own duty to be a protectorof my son and his friends and the kids yet to come in the face of the rocky future we’ve locked in for all of them
2392,the role of the protector in the wrong hands can be lethal
2393,in moments of crisis strong men step into it with far too much ease announcing themselves ready to protect the flock from all evil asking only absolute power and blind obedience in return
2394,yet the spirit of protection that infused the camp had nothing in common with that all powerful patriarchal figure
2395,here was a protection born of intimate knowledge of human frailty and it was not the oneway passive kind of protection that can go so very wrong
2396,this protection was reciprocal and it blurred all separation the water land and air protect and sustain all of usthe very least we can do is protect them or is it us
2397,when they or is it we
2398,are threatened
2399,when the people here faced off against armored tanks and riot police chanting mni wiconi  they were giving voice to that core principle protect the water because water protects all of us
2400,the same sense of vulnerability and reciprocity guided the veterans’ presence as well
2401,on december 5 the obama administration announced it had denied the permit to lay the pipeline under the tribe’s water reservoir
2402,that evening a “forgiveness ceremony” was held on the reservation
2403,for hours hundreds of vets lined up to beg forgiveness of the elders for crimes committed against indigenous peoples over centuries by the military institutions they served
2404,wesley clark jr one of the main organizers of the veterans’ delegation to standing rock began by saying many of us me particularly are from the units that have hurt you over the many years
2405,we came
2406,we fought you
2407,we took your land
2408,we signed treaties that we broke
2409,we stole minerals from your sacred hills
2410,we blasted the faces of our presidents onto your sacred mountain
2411,then we took still more land and then we took your children and then we triedto eliminate your language that god gave you and the creator gave you
2412,we didn’t respect you we polluted your earth we’ve hurt you in so many ways but we have come to say that we are sorry
2413,a path through anger amidst the tears and the sage smoke we felt the touch of history
2414,and something else too a way to deal with rage and grief that went beyond venting
2415,so soon after such a divisive crude election it came as a tremendous relief
2416,for weeks the screens that occupy too much of my life had been engulfed in that unrelenting rage and in angry circular debates about who or what was the one and only true cause of the mess we were now in
2417,trump won because of the racism of america end of discussion some said
2418,no he didn’t it was the elitism of the corporate demsbernie would have fixed everything others roared
2419,no he won because of capitalism the issue above all othersracism and white supremacy are a sideshow
2420,no identity politics is what destroyed us you whiners and dividers
2421,no it was misogyny you bunch of flaming assholes
2422,no it was the fossil fuel industry determined to suck out their last megaprofits regardless of how much they destabilize the earth
2423,plenty of good points were made but it was striking that the goal was rarely to change minds or find common ground
2424,the goal was to win the argument
2425,and then within minutes all that venom dried up
2426,those battles suddenly made as little sense as putting an oil pipeline under this community’s drinking water sourcea pipeline that was originally supposed to pass through the majoritywhite city of bismarck where it was widely rejected over concerns about safety
2427,in the camps surrounded by people who had been fighting the most powerful industries on earth the idea that there was any kind of competition between these issues dropped away
2428,in standing rock it was just so clear that it was all of it a single system
2429,it was ecocidal capitalism that was determined to ram that pipeline through the missouri river consent and climate change be damned
2430,it was searing racism that made it possible to do in standing rock what was deemed impossible in bismarck and to treat water protectors as pests to be blasted away with water cannons in frigid weather
2431,modern capitalism white supremacy and fossil fuels were strands of the same braid inseparable
2432,and they were all woven together here on this patch of frozen land
2433,as the great anishinaabe writer and organizer winona laduke wrote of the standoff “this is a moment of extreme corporate rights and extreme racism faced with courage prayers and resolve” it’s a battle that knows no borders
2434,all around the world the people doing the sacred work of protecting fragile ecologies from industrial onslaught are facing dirty wars
2435,according to a report from the human rights watchdog global witness “more than three people were killed a week in 2015 defending their land forests and rivers against destructive industries
2436,increasingly communities that take a stand are finding themselves in the firing line of companies’ private security state forces and a thriving market for contract killers” about 40 percent of the victims they estimate are indigenous
2437,since the election i had been longing for some kind of gathering of progressive thinkers and organizersto strategize unite and find a way through the next four years of trump’s daily barrage the kind of discussion that had been so abruptly interrupted in australia on the daynight of the election
2438,i pictured it happening at a university in big halls
2439,i didn’t expect to find that space at standing rock
2440,but that is indeed where i discovered it in the camps’ combination of reaction and contemplation and in the constant learningbydoing modeled by brave bull allard and so many other leaders here
2441,at standing rock they did not in the end manage to stop the pipelineat least not yet
2442,in a flagrant betrayal of the treaty and land rights trump immediately reversed obama’s decision and allowed the companyflanked by layers of militarized policeto ram the pipe under lake oahe without the consent of the standing rock sioux
2443,as i write oil is flowing beneath the community’s drinking water reservoir and the pipe could burst at any time
2444,that outrage is being challenged in the courts and extensive pressure is being put on the banks that financed the project
2445,roughly 80 million and counting has been pulled from the banks that have invested in the pipeline
2446,but the oil still flows
2447, i will never forget the experience of being at the main camp when the news arrived after the months of resistance that the obama administration had finally denied the pipeline permit
2448,i happened to be standing with tokata iron eyes a fiercely grounded yet playful thirteenyearold from standing rock who had helped kickstart the movement against the pipeline
2449,i turned on my phone video and asked her how she felt about the breaking news
2450,“like i have my future back” she replied and then she burst into tears
2451,i did too
2452,thanks to trump tokata has again lost that sense of safety
2453,and yet his action cannot and does not erase the profound learning that took place during all those months on the land
2454,the modeling of a form of resistance that with one hand said no to an imminent threat and with the other worked tirelessly to build the yes that is the world we want and need
2455,chapter thirteen a time to leap because small steps won’t cut it “we can’t keep asking our members to sacrifice
2456,they are losing so much
2457,they need those pipeline jobswe have to offer them something” the man making this plea was an executive of a major trade union with many members in canada’s oil and gas sector
2458,sitting in a large circle sixty people listened and shifted in their chairs
2459,what he was saying was undeniable
2460,everyone has a right to a decent job
2461,and energy workers are hurting badly
2462,but the people in the room knew too that the case for even one more pipeline was not a matter of bargaining with environmentalists it was a doomed attempt to bargain with science and chemistry
2463,it is impossible to both keep building new fossil fuel infrastructure and have a chance of keeping temperatures at anything like safe levels
2464,that’s when arthur manuel took the floor
2465,a highly respected indigenous intellectual and former chief from the secwepemc nation in british columbia manuel leaned forward looked the union leader in the eye and spoke just above a whisper
2466,“do you think you are the only people who have had to sacrifice
2467,do you know how much money how many jobs my people have turned down from oil and gas and mining companies
2468,tens of millions of dollars
2469,“we do it because there are things that are more important than money” it felt as if the whole room was holding its breath
2470,it was one of several wrenchingly honest exchanges that happened over the course of a twoday gathering in toronto in may 2015 in the room were leaders and organizers from haida gwaii on the west coast to halifax on the east coast representing movements across a huge spectrum of issues and identities
2471,we had come together to figure out what connects the crises facing us and to try to chart a holistic vision for the future that would overcome many of the overlapping challenges at the same time
2472,just as in standing rock more and more people are starting to see and speak about these connectionspointing out for instance that the economic interests pushing hardest for war at home and abroad are the very same forces most responsible for warming the planet
2473,and that the economic precariousness that the union representative was speaking about and the attacks on indigenous land rights and on the earth itself that were referenced by arthur manuel who died suddenly at the start of 2017 also flow from the same place a corrosive values system that places profit above the wellbeing of people and the planet
2474,the same system has allowed the pursuit of money to so corrode the political process in the united states that a gang of scandalplagued plutocrats could seize control of the white house
2475,the connections between so many of the emergencies that compete for our time and care are clear
2476,glaring even
2477,and yet for so many reasonspressure from funders a desire for “clickable” campaigns a fear of seeming too radical and therefore doomedmany of us have learned to sever those natural connections and work in terms of walledoff “issues” or silos
2478,antiausterity people rarely talk about climate change
2479,climate change people rarely talk about war or occupation
2480,too seldom within the environmental movement are connections made between the guns that take black lives on the streets of cities such as ferguson and ottawa and the rising seas and devastating droughts destroying the homelands of black and brown people around the world
2481,rarely are the dots connected between the powerful men who think they have the right to use and abuse women’s bodies and the widespread notion that humans have the right to do the same thing to the earth
2482,so many of the crises we are facing are symptoms of the same underlying sickness a dominancebased logic that treats so many people and the earth itself as disposable
2483,we came together out of a belief that the persistence of these disconnections of this siloed thinking is why progressives are losing ground on virtually every front left fighting for scraps when we all know that our historical moment demands transformative change
2484,these divisions and compa  rtmen taliz atio nsthe hesitancy to identify the systems we are up againstare robbing us of our full potential and have trained too many to believe that lasting solutions will always be out of reach
2485,we also came together out of a belief that overcoming those divisionsfinding and strengthening the threads that run through our various issues and movementsis our most pressing task
2486,that out of those connections would emerge a larger and more firedup progressive coalition than we have seen in decades one capable of taking on not only the symptoms of a failed system but maybe even the system itself
2487,our goal and it wasn’t modest was to try to map not just the world we don’t want but the one we want instead
2488,the diversity in the room led to plenty of tough exchanges
2489,but with long painful histories of failed collaborations and too much broken trust tough is what happens when people finally decide to make space to dream together
2490,you’d think imagining the world we want would be fun and easy
2491,in fact it’s the hardest work of all
2492,it also happens to be our only hope
2493,as we have seen trump and his cohorts are intent on pushing the world backward on every front all at once
2494,only a competing vision that is pushing us forward on multiple fronts has a chance against a force like that
2495,our experiment in mapping these intersectional agendas began in canada but it’s part of an international conversationin the us the uk australia across europe and beyondin which more and more people are arriving at the same conclusion it’s time to unite around a common agenda that can directly battle the political poison spreading through our countries
2496,no is not enoughit’s time for some big bold yeses to rally around
2497,time for a people’s shock ever since the 2008 financial meltdown i have been puzzling over the question of what it would take to pull off a truly progressive populist response to the crises we face
2498,i had thought at one point that the factual revelations of climate scienceif we truly understood themmight be the catalyst
2499,after all there couldn’t be a clearer indication that our current system is failing if business as usual is allowed to continue everlarger expanses of our planet will cease to be hospitable to human life
2500,and as we’ve seen responding effectively to climate change requires throwing out the entire procorporate economic playbookwhich is one of the main reasons so many rightwing ideologues are determined to deny its reality
2501,so it seemed to me that just as the aftermath of the great crash and world war ii became periods of massive social transformation so could the climate crisisan existential threat for humanitybecome an opportunity for onceinacentury social and economic change
2502,the urgency of the climate crisis also gives us something that can be very helpful for getting big things done a firm unyielding science based deadline
2503,we are it bears repeating out of time
2504,we’ve been kicking the can down the road for so many decades that we are just plain out of road
2505,which means if we want a shot at avoiding catastrophic warming we need to start a grand economic and political transition right now 
2506,and yet as we all know climate change doesn’t play out like a market collapse or a war
2507,with the exception of increasingly common monster storms it’s slow and grinding making the warming dangerously easy to push away into our subconscious behind more obvious daily emergencies
2508,which is why what brought us together for that meeting in the spring of 2015 wasn’t only the climate crisis but something that was grabbing frontpage headlines the collapse in oil prices which has been such a problem for exxonmobil rex tillerson and vladimir putin
2509,for us in canadawhere governments had bet the farm on the expensive tarry oil in albertathe sudden drop in price was proving a devastating economic blow
2510,investors started fleeing from the tar sands tens of thousands of workers were losing their jobs and there was no plan bwhether for creating jobs or raising government revenues
2511,for years canadians had been hearing that we had to choose between a healthy environment and a robust economynow it turned out we had neither
2512,huge swaths of alberta had been logged and contaminated to get at that heavy oil indigenous land rights had been grossly betrayed and the economy was tanking anyway
2513,indeed it was tanking precisely because we had pinned so much on a commodity whose price was on a roller coaster ride nobody seemed able to control
2514,which was why a few of us had started discussing the idea of a national meeting wondering if perhaps the oil price collapse combined with the urgency of the climate crisis might provide the catalyst for the deep transformation our society and economy needs on so many fronts
2515,we began imagining that we could seize this juncture of overlapping crises to advance policies that dramatically improve lives close the gap between rich and poor create large numbers of wellpaying lowcarbon jobs and reinvigorate democracy from the ground up
2516,this would be the inverse of the shock doctrine
2517,it would be a people’s shock a blow from below
2518,so we sent out a letter headed “from price shock to energy shift” and invited leaders from across the country to meet in a circle for two days and dream big
2519,i’m sharing what happened next in the hope that the experience might be useful at a time when so many are looking for ways to bridge divides
2520,a platform without a party in response to our invitation they came
2521,heads of labor federations and unions directors of major green groups iconic indigenous and feminist leaders key organizers and theorists focused on migrant rights open technology food justice housing faith and more
2522,the fact that we were able to bring so many players together with only a few weeks’ notice reflected a shared understanding that this was a rare political openingnot unlike the 2008 financial crisis
2523,only this time people were determined not to let the opportunity pass us by
2524,the other factor lending urgency to our gathering was a looming federal election campaign
2525,the conservative party led by the extremely prooil stephen harper had been in power for a decade but the national mood was shifting and the political landscape looked likely to change
2526,yet at that stage in the campaign there wasn’t a political party that had succeeded in exciting voters with a different vision for the country
2527,on climate both principal opposition parties the centrist liberals under justin trudeau and the centerleft new democratic partywere running conventional campaigns that called for new tar sands pipelines still failing to honestly reckon with either the price collapse or the climate crisis
2528,so at our gathering we decided to do something that movements in our country had not attempted for several decades intervene in a national election by writing a “people’s platform” one that would attempt to reflect the needs not of one particular constituency but of a great many at once
2529,we saw this as a chance to begin to heal not only our relationship with the planet but the colonial and racial wounds that date back to our country’s founding
2530,we kept something else in mind too the way of life that is leading to both climatic and economic destabilization is creating other crises as well
2531,it’s giving rise to an epidemic of anxiety and despair expressed through everything from rising prescription drug dependence to high suicide rates from road rage to screen addiction
2532,so we asked ourselves to imagine what would it take to build happier healthier communities
2533,and could those be the same things that would make the planet healthier
2534,in short we aimed high
2535,it felt on some cellular level like the only moral thing to do for everyone in the room whether they were working on migration or homelessness or indigenous land rights or the climate there had rarely been so much at stake
2536,the goal was to come up with a vision so concrete and inspiring that voters could practically speaking do two things at once
2537,they could go to the polls to vote against what they didn’t want the disastrous government of the day and they would still have a space even if it was outside electoral politics to say yes to a vision we hoped would reflect what many actually do want by adding their names to our people’s platform or otherwise voicing public support
2538,we figured that if we built up enough momentum behind the platform it might exert some pressure on our elected representatives
2539,but before that could happen we first had to agree on the planks of the documentand that wasn’t going to be easy
2540,connections not competition there were a few ground rules in that initial meeting some unspoken some not
2541,the first was that no one was allowed to play “my crisis is bigger than your crisis” nor argue that because of the urgency and scope of the climate crisis it should take precedence over fighting poverty or racism or other major concerns
2542,instead of ranking issues we started from the premise that we live in a time of multiple intersecting crises and since all of them are urgent we cannot afford to fix them sequentially
2543,what we need are integrated solutions concrete ideas for how to radically bring down emissions while creating huge numbers of unionized jobs and delivering meaningful justice to those who have been abused and excluded under the current extractive economy
2544,another ground rule was that respectful conflict is healthy and a necessary part of getting to new territory
2545,arguments mean it’s working
2546,many of the groups and people in the room talked about how while they had formed coalitions before most had been coalitions of “no” no to a lousy procorporate trade deal no to a punishing austerity agenda no to a particularly egregious politician no to oil pipelines or fracking
2547,but we realized that it had been a long time since the progressive side of the political spectrum had assembled to say yes let alone yes to a sweeping vision for the next economy
2548,so conflicts were inevitable especially since like all gatherings ours was imperfect with people missing from the room who should have been there
2549,there were moments of ease and joy too where ideas for a “just transition” flowed fast and furious
2550,whiteboards grew crowded with suggestions and questions • free highquality child care
2551,• less driving
2552,• less work more music and gardens and family
2553,• superfast trains
2554,solar roads
2555,we also heard challenges we knew we couldn’t resolve in two days but would continue puzzling over for years • if we don’t address ownership how can we move toward equitable justice
2556,• how do we move beyond the idea that what we own is what protects us
2557,security comes from community from solidarity
2558,security is based on how solid my ties are not how much i own
2559,• how do we build the public sector so we the public  feel part of it
2560,we should all feel ownership over public housing public resources
2561,• how can we ensure that informal and unpaid work around caregiving domestic work and land care is recognized and valued in a just transition
2562,• what should a guaranteed basic income look like
2563,• climate justice is indivisible from decolonization
2564,how do we imagine reparations to the people most impacted by extractive industries and climate change
2565,and on all our minds as so many thousands of refugees continued to flee their homes in search of safety • migrants are not looking at the climate crisis
2566,they are in the climate crisis
2567,lead with values not policies my role in all this was to listen closely to the two days of conversations notice common themes and come up with a rough first draft which everyone would have an opportunity to revise
2568,it was the most challenging assignment of my writing life i struggle to cowrite with one other person let alone sixty
2569,and yet some very clear common themes emerged that made a synthesis possible
2570,one such theme was that we have a system based on limitless taking and extracting on maximum grabbing
2571,our economy takes endlessly from workers asking more and more from them in evertighter time frames even as employers offer less and less security and lower wages in return
2572,many of our communities are being pushed to a similar breaking point schools parks transit and other services have had resources clawed back from them over many decades even as residents have less time to fill in the gaps
2573,and of course we are all part of a system that takes endlessly from the earth’s natural bounty without protecting cycles of regeneration and while paying dangerously little attention to where we are offloading pollution whether it be into the water systems that sustain life or the atmosphere that keeps our climate system in balance
2574,listening to the storiesworkers being laid off after a lifetime of service immigrants facing indefinite detention under deplorable conditions indigenous knowledge and culture ignored and attacked it was clear to all of us that this is what a system addicted to short term profits and wealth is structurally required to do it treats people and the earth either like resources to be mined to their limits or as garbage to be disposed of far out of sight whether deep in the ocean or deep in a prison cell
2575,in sharp contrast when people spoke about the world they wanted the words care and caretaking came up again and againcare for the land for the planet’s living systems and for one another
2576,as we talked that became a frame within which everything seemed to fit the need for a shift from a system based on endless takingfrom the earth and from one anotherto a culture based on caretaking the principle that when we take we also take care and give back
2577,a system in which everyone is valued and we don’t treat people or the natural world as if they were disposable
2578,acting with care and consent rather than extractively and through force became the idea binding the whole draft together starting with respect for the knowledge and inherent rights of indigenous peoples the original caretakers of the land water and air
2579,though many of us including me had originally thought we were convening to draft a list of policy goals we realized that this shift in values and indeed in morality was at the core of what we were trying to map
2580,the specifics of policy all flowed from that shift
2581,for example when we talk about “green jobs” we usually picture a guy in a hard hat putting up a solar array
2582,and that is one kind of green job and an important one
2583,but it’s not the only one
2584,looking after elderly and sick people doesn’t burn a lot of carbon
2585,making art doesn’t burn a lot of carbon
2586,teaching is lowcarbon
2587,day care is lowcarbon
2588,and yet this work overwhelmingly done by women tends to be undervalued and underpaid and is frequently the target of government cutbacks
2589,so we decided to deliberately extend the traditional definition of a green job to anything useful and enriching to our communities that doesn’t burn a lot of fossil fuels
2590,as one participant said “nursing is renewable energy
2591,education is renewable energy” it was an attempt in short to show how to replace an economy built on destruction with an economy built on love
2592,red lines we tried to touch on as many issues as possible that reflected the values shift people were calling for from welcoming many more migrants to putting an end to trade deals that force us to choose between “growth” on the one hand and protecting the environment and creating local jobs on the other
2593,but we also decided to resist the temptation to make laundry lists that would cover every conceivable demand
2594,instead we emphasized the frame that showed how so many of our challengesand solutionsare interconnected because the frame could then be expanded in whatever place or community the vision was applied
2595,at the same time there were certain demands specific to different groups in the room that needed to be in the platform
2596,for the indigenous participants it was crucial to call for the full implementation of the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples which states that no development can take place on the land of indigenous peoples without their “free prior and informed consent” for the climate activists there needed to be an acknowledgment that no new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built
2597,for trade union participants it was critical to call for workers to be not only retrained for new green jobs but democratic participants in that retraining
2598,for many people in the room a bright red line was a rejection of nostalgia
2599,the platform could not fall back on an idealized memory of a country that had always relied on land theft and the systematic economic and social exclusion of many communities of color
2600,the inspiration would have to come from the picture of the future that we painted together
2601,ellen gabriel one of the coauthors of the draft and a wellknown indigenous rights activist from kanehsatàke in the province of quebec said the process for her represented “a rebirth of humanity” rebirth not a resurrection
2602,christina sharpe a tufts professor of english who wrote a powerful book called in the wake about the ongoing reverberations of the slave trade participated in a recent discussion inspired by the platform and offered an important warning on this score the task she said was “to connect but not collapse” this means that though we can and must look for points of unity and commonality across very different experiences and issues everything cannot be blended into an indecipherable mush of lowestcommondenominator platitudes
2603,the integrity of individual movements the specificities of community experiences must be reflected and protected even as we come together in an attempt to weave a unified vision
2604,in it together in a way we asked ourselves this what are the qualities that we value most in people
2605,those included generosity hospitality warmth and wisdom
2606,and then we asked ourselves what do those qualities look like when expressed in public as policy
2607,we discovered that one of the things those qualities reflect is openness
2608,which means nurturing a culture that welcomes those in need rather than greeting strangers with fear and suspicion that values elders and the knowledge they have accumulated over lifetimes as well as the ways of knowing that long predate this very recent invention called canada
2609,bianca mugyenyi who coleads the organization that came out of the gathering boils that principle down when it comes to climate and migration the refugee flows we’re seeing now are just a glimpse of what’s to come
2610,climate change and migration are intimately linked and we’re going to see massive displacement of people caused by sealevel rise and extreme weather in the decades to come all around the world
2611,so there’s a question facing all of us are we all in this together
2612,we think most people given the opportunity believe that we are
2613,you see it over and over in times of crisis when people step up for others in their communities but also for complete strangers
2614,but we need our immigration border and social support systems to catch up with this idea
2615,the leap is about speaking to our better selves
2616,energy reparations today the energy most of us use is owned by a tiny number of corporations that generate it for the profit of their shareholders
2617,their primary goal indeed their fiduciary duty is to produce maximum profitwhich is why most energy companies have been so reluctant to switch to renewables
2618,but what we asked if the energy we use was owned by ordinary citizens and controlled democratically
2619,what if we changed the nature of the energy and the structure of its ownership
2620,so we decided that we didn’t want to be buying renewable power from exxonmobil and shell even if they were offering itwe wanted that power generation to be owned by the public by communities or by energy cooperatives
2621,if energy systems are owned by us democratically then we can use the revenues to build social services needed in rural areas towns and citiesday cares elder care community centers and transit systems instead of wasting it on say 180million retirement packages for the likes of rex tillerson
2622,this turn toward communitycontrolled energy was pioneered in denmark in the eighties with government policies that encouraged and subsidized cooperatively owned wind farms and it has been embraced on a large scale in germany
2623, roughly half of germany’s renewable energy facilities are in the hands of farmers citizen groups and almost nine hundred energy cooperatives in denmark in 2000 roughly 85 percent of the country’s wind turbines were owned by small players such as farmers and coops
2624,both countries have shown that this model carries immense social benefits and is compatible with a very rapid transition
2625,there are some days when denmark generates far more power from its wind farms than it can useso it exports the surplus to germany and sweden
2626,we were inspired by these modelsand by the hundreds of thousands of jobs they have createdbut we were equally inspired by examples in the united states where through networks like the climate justice alliance lowincome communities of color have been fighting to make sure the places that have been most polluted and neglected benefit first from a largescale green energy transition
2627,in canada the same patterns are clear our collective reliance on dirty energy over the past couple of hundred years has taken its highest toll on the poorest and most vulnerable people overwhelmingly indigenous and immigrant
2628,that’s whose lands have been stolen and poisoned by mining
2629,that’s who gets the most polluting refineries and power plants in their neighborhoods
2630,so in addition to calling for “energy democracy” on the german model we placed reparative justice at the center of the energy transition calling for indigenous and other frontline communities such as immigrant neighborhoods where coal plants have fouled the air to be first in line to receive public funds to own and control their own green energy projectswith the jobs profits and skills staying in those communities
2631,a justicebased transition also means that workers in highcarbon sectorsmany of whom have sacrificed their health in coal mines and oil refineriesmust be full and democratic participants
2632,our guiding principle was no worker left behind
2633,in summary our plan argued that in the process of fundamentally changing our country to make it cleaner we also have a historic opportunity to make it a lot fairer
2634,as we move to get off fossil fuels we can simultaneously begin to redress the terrible wrongs done to indigenous peoples radically reduce economic racial and gender inequalities eliminate glaring double standards for immigrant workers and we can create a whole lot of stable wellpaying jobs in green sectors in land and water remediation and in the caring professions
2635,kids would have an opportunity to be healthier because they wouldn’t be breathing toxic air our increasingly aging society could be provided with healthier community living and we could spend less time stuck in traffic working long hours and more time with our friends and families
2636,a happier more balanced society in other words with the definition of happiness liberated from the endless cycle of everescalating consumption that underlies the logic of branding and fueled the rise of donald trump
2637,it sounded good to us andin very uncanadian fashionwe even dared to hope that the manifesto might become a model for similar broadbased alliances beyond our country’s borders
2638,yes we can afford to save ourselves we knew that the greatest obstacle our platform would face was the force of austerity logicthe message we have all received over decades that governments are perpetually broke so why even bother dreaming of a genuinely equitable society
2639,with this in mind we worked closely with a team of economists to cost out how we could raise the revenues to pay for our plan
2640,the key tools included ending fossil fuel subsidies worth about 775 billion globally getting a fairer share of the financial sector’s massive earnings by imposing a transaction tax which could raise 650 billion globally according to the european parliament increasing royalties on fossil fuel extraction raising income taxes on corporations and the wealthiest people lots of room therea one percent billionaire’s tax alone could raise 45 billion globally according to the united nations a progressive carbon tax a 50 tax per metric ton of co 2 emitted in developed countries would raise an estimated 450 billion annually and making cuts to military spending if the military budgets of the top ten military spenders globally were cut by 25 percent that would free up 325 billion according to numbers reported by the stockholm international peace research institute
2641,to our chagrin we neglected to include a call to shut down tax havens perhaps the greatest potential revenue source of all
2642,the math is clear the money for this great transition is out there we just need governments with the guts to go after it
2643,so that in summary was our visionto invest in those sectors that tangibly improve our quality of life and create more caring societies rather than hacking away at them in the name of that manufactured crisis called “austerity” and we were committed to embedding justice in every aspect of the transition
2644,the opposite of the art of the deal as i look back on the drafting process it strikes me that it is about as far away from trump’s “how can i screw you” art of the deal as you can get
2645,no one got everything they wanted or even sought to
2646,there were serious disagreements but to arrive at the final document everyone made concessions nobody went to the wall
2647,this giveandtake reflected the principles and values that emerged from our discussions if the goal is to move from a society based on endless taking and depletion to one based on caretaking and renewal then all of our relationships have to be grounded in those same principles of reciprocity and carebecause our relationships with one another are our most valuable resource of all
2648,and that’s the antithesis of bullying one another into submission
2649,yes to the “yes” after a few weeks of backandforth over wording we had a final draft of the platform acceptable to almost everyone at the original gathering
2650,the full text appears at the end of the book
2651,we also agreed on a name the leap manifestoa call for a canada based on caring for the earth and one another 
2652,we chose leap because it raises a defiant middle finger to centrist incrementalismthe kind that calls itself “cautious” but is in fact exquisitely dangerous at this late stage in the climate crisis
2653,the gap between where we are and where we need to go is so great and the time left is so short that small steps are not going to cut itwe need to leap
2654,my partner avi lewis who is one of the document’s coauthors puts it like this with the leap the scale of the plan matches the scale of the crisis
2655,and for many of us this comes as a cosmic relief at last a set of demands that actually acknowledges how much and how fast we need to change
2656,the leap rings true because it sees the climate crisis not as a technical problem to be solved by engineers but as a crisis of a system and an economic philosophy
2657,the leap identifies the root cause of the climate crisisand it’s the dominant economic logic of our time extractivism to feed perpetual growth rooted in everincreasing consumption
2658,that’s a scary level of change but it’s honest
2659,and people know in their bones that it’s the kind of change we need
2660,before releasing it to the public we asked many organizations and trusted public figures to become initiating signatories
2661,again and again we heard yes
2662,this is who we want to be
2663,let’s push our politicians
2664,cautious centrism be damned 
2665,national icons stood with us without hesitation neil young
2666,leonard cohen then still with us
2667,the novelist yann martel wrote back that it should “be shouted in every square by every town crier this country has” this was a rare document that could be signed by large organizations such as greenpeace and oxfam the canadian union of public employees the largest in the country the head of the canadian labour congress the union of unions as well as truly grassroots groups such as black lives matter–toronto and no one is illegal–coast salish territories and the country’s largest membership based advocacy organization the council of canadians
2668,original endorsers included supporters of all parties and some who support none
2669,all shared the belief that if the major political parties weren’t offering voters a plan commensurate with the multiple crises we face then it would have to come from outside electoral politics
2670,within days of the leap’s launch thousands of people had added their names soon tens of thousands and well over two hundred endorsing organizations
2671,we were stunned
2672,it was clear that a whole lot of people after decades of fighting against what they don’t want tar sands pipelines money in politics corporate trade deals draconian security billswere ready to rally around the world they do want
2673,the outpouring reminded me of a slogan i first heard in argentina during a raucous election campaign “our dreams don’t fit on your ballot” that’s what people were saying by signing the leap yes i am going to cast a ballot in this deeply flawed and constricted electoral system but do not mistake that vote as an expression of the world i want
2674,the leap was creating a space in which to register that electoral politics at this point in history so often fails to reflect both the dreams and the very urgent needs of huge numbers of people
2675,but the real trick in canada the united states and everywhere else is going to be to get those dreams on the ballot with a winning strategy as quickly as possible
2676,exploding the box the reaction from the corporate press ranged from confusion how can there be a platform without a party
2677,why drop it in the middle of an election campaign
2678,to rage
2679,one of canada’s national newspapers declared the leap’s call for a country based on caring for each other and the planet “madness” another one deemed it “national suicide” we weren’t surprised
2680,we knew that what we were proposing did not fit inside the box of what is considered politically possible in mainstream political discussions
2681,but what we are trying to do with the leapquite explicitlyis explode the box
2682,because if the box doesn’t leave room for the safety and possibly the survival of our species then there is something very very wrong with that box
2683,if what is considered politically possible today consigns us to a future of climate chaos the day after tomorrow then we have to change what’s politically possible
2684,and many clearly agreed
2685,despite some mystified mainstream reporting people kept signing kept asking us for leap lawn signs kept selforganizing local leap chapters in their cities towns schools and unions
2686,and they kept sending us photos of their leap teachins sitins and rallieseven audio of the songs it was inspiring
2687,a national poll found that a clear majority of supporters of all three center and centerleft partiesthe liberals the ndp and the green partywere in agreement with the leap’s key demands
2688,even 20 percent of conservatives said they were on board
2689,in the end canadians did vote out stephen harper but the biggest loser in the election was the ndp our centerleft party
2690,it had run an extremely cautious campaign and been outflanked on the left by justin trudeau’s liberals who made up for what they lacked in specifics with dazzling progressive pr
2691,at the ndp convention a few months later young delegates led an internal revolt convinced that the party could have won if it had gone bold they called on delegates to officially endorse the spirit of the leap manifesto
2692,the resolution passeda rare example of a major political party even considering a platform offered by outside social movements
2693,the living leap in the months since its launch the leap has become a living evolving project with an evergrowing community of supporters constantly enriching and revising the work
2694,our team is also working closely with organizers around the world who are kicking off similar experiments from the australian group i met with on the eve of trump’s election win to a coalition of green parties in europe who have written their own leapinspired manifesto to communities from nunavut in the arctic to the us gulf south and the bronx that are exploring how to adapt the document’s framework to their local needs and most pressing crises
2695,there is even a community of “leapers” in prison at a connecticut detention facility for teenaged boys tried as adults a group of incarcerated students has been exploring ways that a justice based transition off fossil fuels could be part of a process that keeps young people like them out of prison
2696,my favorite example of what our team now calls “the living leap” involves the canadian union of postal workers
2697,like postal employees around the world these workers have been coping with a push to shut down their workplaces restrict mail delivery and maybe even sell off the public postal service to fedex
2698,in other words austerity and privatization as usual
2699,but instead of fighting for the best deal they can get under this failed logic they worked with the leap team and a group called friends of public services to put together a visionary plan for every post office in the country to become a local hub for the green transition
2700,combined with the union’s longstanding demand for postal banking the proposal called “delivering community power” reimagines the post office as a twentyfirstcentury network where residents can recharge electric vehicles individuals and businesses can do an end run around the big banks and get a loan to start an energy coop and postal workers do more than deliver the mailthey also deliver locally grown produce and check in on the elderly
2701,in other words they become care workers and climate workersand they do it all in vehicles that are electric and made in canada
2702,at first there was a lot of pressure on the leap team to start our own party or run candidates in existing ones using the manifesto as its platform
2703,we resisted those calls wanting to protect the leap’s movement roots and not wanting it to be owned by any one party
2704,the vitality of the leap today especially since trump’s election lies in the people inside canada and out who are using it more and more as the basis for their own local work and electoral platforms
2705,for instance in thunder bay a northern canadian city with a long reliance on logging a local leap group has decided to run a slate of candidates for city council writing their own version of the manifesto and using it to lay out how their city could be a hub for green manufacturing while battling homelessness and defending indigenous land rights
2706,and in march 2017 in a hardfought campaign for state representative in pennsylvania legendary housing and antipoverty activist cheri honkala ran on a pledge to create “a platform derived from the leap manifesto” citing the need to address the “crises of climate change inequality and racism together” utopiaback by popular demand the leap is part of a shift in the political zeitgeist as many are realizing that the future depends on our ability to come together across painful divides and to take leadership from those who traditionally have been most excluded
2707,we have reached the limits of siloed politics where everyone fights in their own corner without mapping the connections between our various struggles and without a clear idea of the concepts and values that must form the moral foundation of the future we need
2708,that recognition doesn’t mean that resisting the very specific attacks on families on people’s bodies on communities on individual rights is suddenly optional
2709,there is no choice but to resist just as there is no choice but to run insurgent progressive candidates at every level of government from federal down to the local school board
2710,in the months and years to come the various resistance tactics described in this book are going to be needed more than ever the street protests the strikes the court challenges the sanctuaries the solidarity across divisions of race gender and sexual identityall are going to be essential
2711,and we will need to continue pushing institutions to divest from the industries that profit off various forms of dispossession from fossil fuels to prisons to war and occupation
2712,and yet even if every one of these resistance fights is victoriousand we know that’s not going to be possiblewe would still be standing in the same place we were before the far right started surging with no better chance of addressing the root causes of the systemic crises of which trump is but one virulent symptom
2713,a great many of today’s movement leaders and key organizers understand this well and are planning and acting accordingly
2714,alicia garza one of the founders of black lives matter said on the eve of trump’s inauguration that after five years of swelling social movements whether it be occupy wall street whether it be the dreamers movement or black lives matterthere’s a particular hope that i have that all of those movements will join together to become the powerful force that we can be that will actually govern this country
2715,so that’s what i’m focused on and i hope that everybody else is thinking about that too
2716,many people are and as they do we’re seeing a rekindling of the kind of utopian dreaming that has been sorely missing from social movements in recent decades
2717,more and more frequently immediate pressing demandsa 15anhour living wage an end to police killings and deportations a tax on carbonare being paired with calls for a future that is not just better than a violent untenable present butwonderful
2718,in the united states the boldest and most inspiring example of this new utopianism is the vision for black lives a sweeping policy platform released in the summer of 2016 by the movement for black lives
2719,born of a coalition of over fifty blackled organizations the platform states “we reject false solutions and believe we can achieve a complete transformation of the current systems which place profit over people and make it impossible for many of us to breathe” it goes on to place police shootings and mass incarceration in the context of an economic system that has waged war on black and brown communities putting them first in line for lost jobs hackedback social services and environmental pollution
2720,the result has been huge numbers of people exiled from the formal economy preyed upon by increasingly militarized police and warehoused in overcrowded prisons
2721,and the platform makes a series of concrete proposals including defunding prisons removing police from schools and demilitarizing police
2722,it also lays out a program for reparations for slavery and systemic discrimination one that includes free college education and forgiveness of student loans
2723,there is much more nearly forty policy demands in all spanning changes to the tax code to breaking up the banks
2724,the atlantic magazine remarked that the platformwhich was dropped smack in the middle of the us presidential campaign “rivals even politicalparty platforms in thoroughness” in the months after trump’s inauguration the movement for black lives played a central role in deepening connections with other movements convening dozens of groups under the banner “the majority” the new formation kicked off with a thrilling monthlong slate of actions between april 4 the anniversary of dr martin luther king’s assassination and may day
2725,nationwide “fight racism raise pay” protests linked racial justice to the fastgrowing workers’ campaign for a 15 minimum wage and the mounting attacks on immigrants
2726,“in the context of trump’s presidency” the new coalition argues “it is imperative that we put forth a true collective vision of economic justice and worker justice for all people” and in june 2017 thousands of activists from diverse constituencies are descending on chicago for the second annual people’s summit organized by national nurses united to continue hashing out a broadbased “people’s agenda” several similar statelevel convergences are also under way in michigan as well as north carolina where “moral mondays” have been bringing movements together for several years
2727,as one of its founders reverend william barber has said “you have to build a movement not a momenti believe all these movementsmoral mondays fight for 15 black lives matterare signs of hope that people are going to stand up and not stand down” as it has in canada the climate crisis is pushing us to put plans for political transformation on a tight and unyielding deadline
2728,a powerful and broad coalition called new york renews is pushing hard for the state to transition entirely to renewable energy by 2050 if more us states adopt these kinds of ambitious targets and other countries do the same sweden for instance has a target of carbon neutrality by 2045 then trump and tillerson’s most nefarious efforts may be insufficient to tip the planet into climate chaos
2729,it’s becoming possible to see a genuine path forwardnew political formations that from their inception will marry the fight for economic fairness with a deep analysis of how racism and misogyny are used as potent tools to enforce a system that further enriches the already obscenely wealthy on the backs of both people and the planet
2730,formations that could become home to the millions of people who are engaging in activism and organizing for the first time knitting together a multiracial and intergenerational coalition bound by a common transformational project
2731,the plans that are taking shape for defeating trumpism wherever we live go well beyond finding a progressive savior to run for office and then offering that person our blind support
2732,instead communities and movements are uniting to lay out the core policies that politicians who want their support must endorse
2733,the people’s platforms are starting to leadand the politicians will have to follow
2734,conclusion the caring majority within reach the hour calls for optimism we’ll save pessimism for better times 
2735,jeanclaude servais i opened this book with the word shock  since that’s what a great many people said they felt on election day and after
2736,but as i’ve reflected on the word during the past months of writing i started to question its accuracy in this context
2737,a state of shock is produced when a story is ruptured when we have no idea what’s going on
2738,but in so many ways explored in these pages trump is not a rupture at all but rather the culminationthe logical end pointof a great many dangerous stories our culture has been telling for a very long time
2739,that greed is good
2740,that the market rules
2741,that money is what matters in life
2742,that white men are better than the rest
2743,that the natural world is there for us to pillage
2744,that the vulnerable deserve their fate and the one percent deserve their golden towers
2745,that anything public or commonly held is sinister and not worth protecting
2746,that we are surrounded by danger and should only look after our own
2747,that there is no alternative to any of this
2748,given these stories are for many of us part of the very air we breathe trump really shouldn’t come as a shock
2749,a billionaire president who boasts he can grab women by their genitals while calling mexicans “rapists” and jeering at the disabled is the logical expression of a culture that grants indecent levels of impunity to the ultrarich that is consumed with winnertakeall competition and that is grounded in dominancebased logic at every level
2750,we should have been expecting him
2751,and indeed many of those most directly touched by the underbelly of western racism and misogyny have been expecting him for a long time
2752,so maybe the emotion beneath what some have been calling shock is really more accurately horror
2753,specifically the horror of recognition that we feel when we read effective dystopian fiction or watch good dystopian films
2754,all stories of this genre take current trends and follow them to their obvious conclusionand then use that conclusion to hold up a mirror and ask do you like what you see
2755,do you really want to continue down this road
2756,these nightmare futures are horrifying precisely because they’re not shockingnot a break with our underlying stories but their fulfillment
2757,i’ve come to believe that we should see america’s first nucleararmed reality tv president in a similar fashion as dystopian fiction come to life
2758,trump is a mirror held up not only to the united states but to the world
2759,if we don’t like what we seeand throngs of us clearly do notthen it is clear what we need to do
2760,we have to question not only trump but the stories that ineluctably produced him
2761,it’s not enough to superficially challenge him as an individual foul and alarmingly ignorant though he may be
2762,we have to confront the deepseated trends that rewarded him and exalted him until he became the most powerful person in the world
2763,the values that have been sold to us through reality tv getrichquick books billionaire saviors phila nthro capit alists
2764,the same values that have been playing out in destroyed safety nets exploding prison numbers normalized rape culture democracydestroying trade deals rising seas and privatized disaster response and in a world of green zones and red zones
2765,at the same time perhaps it’s okayhealthy evenfor us to be just a little bit shocked by trump
2766,here’s why those stories that produced him were always contested
2767,there were always other stories ones that insisted that money is not all that’s valuable and that all of our fates are intertwined with one another and with the health of the rest of the natural world
2768,the forces trump represents have always had to suppress those other older and selfevidently true stories so that theirs could dominate against so much intuition and evidence
2769,the persistence of these other stories should remind us that while trump is the logical culmination of the current neoliberal system the current neoliberal system is not the only logical culmination of the human story
2770,which is why part of our work nowa key partis not just resistance
2771,not just saying no
2772,we have to do that of course
2773,but we also need to fiercely protect some space to dream and plan for a better world
2774,this isn’t an indulgence
2775,it’s an essential part of how we defeat trumpism
2776,killing the trump within for me and this may sound a bit strange trump’s rise has also prompted a more internal kind of challenge it has made me determined to kill my inner trump
2777,we have already seen that the new regime in washington has led a great many people to try to understand and overcome our own latent biases and prejudices the ones that have kept us divided in the past
2778,this internal work is crucial as we come together in resistance and transformation
2779,there are some other oftenoverlooked ways that many of us can do more to confront our inner trumpsomething anything that’s just a little bit trumpish in our habits
2780,and to be clear i’m not saying these omissions make all of us responsible for the outcome of the 2016 electionsthis is not about who voted for whom and why
2781,maybe it’s the part whose attention span is fracturing into 140 characters and that is prone to confusing “followers” with friends
2782,maybe it’s the part that has learned to see ourselves as brands in the marketplace rather than as people in communities
2783,or the part that sees other people doing similar work not as potential allies in a struggle that will need all our talents but as rival products competing for scarce market share
2784,given that trump’s presidency is the culmination of corporate branding’s insidious colonial logic perhaps it’s past time to leave all that behind
2785,or maybe it’s the part that can’t resist joining a mob to shame and attack people with whom we disagreesometimes using cruel personal slurs and with an intensity set to nuclear
2786,at the very real risk of bringing on the kinds of attacks i’m describing is it possible that this habit too is uncomfortably close to the tweeterin chief
2787,or maybe it’s the part that is waiting for a billionaire to ride to the rescue except this one will be kind and generous and concerned about climate change and empowerment for girls
2788,the liberal billionaire savior may appear very far from trump but the fantasy still equates great wealth with superhero powers which once again is just a little too close for comfort to the ministry of maralago
2789,if some of these impulses and stories seem hardwired inside us it’s not because we’re terrible people
2790,it’s because so many of us function within systems that are constantly telling us there are not enough resources for everyone to thrive so we’d better elbow our way to the top whatever the costs
2791,willingly or not anyone who consumes and produces media swims in the cultural waters of reality tv and personal branding and nonstop attentionsplintering messagesthe same waters that produced donald trump
2792,there are different parts of that fetid swimming pool to be sure and some people are in zones with no lifeguards and with way more waterborne diseases than others but it’s still hard to get genuinely outside the pool
2793,recognizing this can help clarify our task to have a hope of changing the world we’re going to have to be willing to change ourselves
2794,the good news is that as we detrumpperhaps resolving to spend a few more hours a week in facetoface relationships or to surrender some ego for the greater good of a project or to recognize the value of so much in life that cannot be bought or soldwe might just get happier
2795,and that is what will keep us in a struggle that does not have a finish line in sight and indeed will require from us lifetimes of engagement
2796,the choice because we can try to fight the global rise of rightwing demagoguery in two possible ways
2797,there’s the establishment option embraced by centrist parties the world over
2798,this promises a little more child care better representation of women and people of color at the top and maybe a few more solar panels
2799,but this option also comes with the same old austerity logic the same blind faith in markets the same equation of endless consumption with happiness the same bandaids on gaping wounds
2800,there are many reasons why this limited vision is utterly failing to stop the surge of the far right around the world but the main one is this it does not have nearly enough to offer
2801,it does nothing to address the real and legitimate grievances that supercharge the search for scapegoats nor does it give the people most endangered by the rising right enough hope for a better future
2802,a society with extreme inequality unmasked neofascist tendencies and an unraveling climate is sick and neoliberalism as one of the major drivers of all of these crises is grossly inadequate medicine
2803,it offers only a weak no to the forces responsible and it lacks a yes worth seizing
2804,a great many of us are clearly ready for another approach a captivating “yes” that lays out a plan for tangible improvements in daily life unafraid of powerful words such as redistribution and reparation  and intent on challenging western culture’s equation of a “good life” with everescalating creature comforts inside evermore isolated consumer cocoons never mind what the planet can take or what actually leads to our deepest fulfillment
2805,and perhaps we should thank trump for this newfound ambition at least in part
2806,the shamelessness of his corporate coup has done a tremendous amount to make systemic change seem more necessary
2807,if titans of american industry can eagerly line up behind this manwith all of his ugly hatreds his venality vanity and vacuousnessand if wall street can cheer on news of his plans to let the planet burn and the elderly starve and if so much of the media can praise his cruise missiles ordered over chocolate cake as “presidential” well then a great many people are coming to the conclusion that they want no part of a system like that
2808,with this elevation of the basest of figures to the most exalted of positions the culture of maximum extraction of endless grabbing and disposing has reached some kind of breaking point
2809,clearly it is the culture itself that must be confronted now and not policy by policy but at the root
2810,what we have seen with insurgent left candidacies and parties in the united states france and elsewhere are not perfect politicians or perfect platforms that have everything figured out
2811,some of the figures who have led these runs sound more like the past than the future and the campaigns they have built often do not mirror the diverse countries they seek to govern or at least not enough
2812,and yet the very fact that these longshot candidates and often brandnew political formations are coming within an arm’s reach of powerrepeatedly stunning pollsters and establishment analystsis proof of a very important fact one that has been denied and suppressed for the many decades of neoliberalism’s stranglehold on public discourse progressive transformational change is popular more than many of us would have dared imagine as recently as just one or two years ago
2813,here is what needs to be understood in our bones the spell of neoliberalism has been broken crushed under the weight of lived experience and a mountain of evidence
2814,what for decades was unsayable is now being said out loud by candidates who win millions of votes free college tuition double the minimum wage  100 percent renewable energy as quickly as technology allows demilitarize the police prisons are no place for young people refugees are welcome here war makes us all less safe 
2815,and the crowds are roaring their agreement
2816,with so much encouragement who knows what’s next
2817,reparations for slavery and colonialism
2818,a marshall plan to fight violence against women
2819,prison abolition
2820,democratic worker coops as the centerpiece of a green jobs program
2821,an abandonment of “growth” as a measure of progress
2822,why not
2823,the intellectual fencing that has constrained the progressive imagination for so long is lying twisted on the ground
2824,the leftwing almostwins of the past two years are not defeats
2825,they are the first tremors of a profound ideological realignment from which a progressive majority could well emergejust as geopolitically significant as the rise of authoritarianism and neofascism on the right side of the spectrum
2826,indeed the weaknesses and missteps of these left candidates should be a cause not for despair but for genuine hope
2827,it means that a much larger political tent is possibleit’s just a matter of collectively and carefully planting the right poles from day one
2828,as many movement leaders are now arguing a very good start would be accepting the premise that widening economic inequality and climate disaster are inseparable from systems that have always ranked human life based on race and gender while the capacity to pit populations against each other based on skin color religious faith and sexuality has been the single most potent tool for protecting and sustaining this lethal order
2829,and if the political formation that has the guts to say all that also has a bold plan for humanizing and democratizing new technologies and global trade then it would quickly seize back populist ground from the right while feeling less like a blast from the past and more like a path to an exciting neverbeforeattempted future
2830,a deeply diverse and insistently forwardlooking campaign like that could well prove unbeatable
2831,if this sounds overly optimistic remember in the united states the number of people showing up to join political movements is swelling to levels beyond anything organizers say they have seen before
2832,marchesfor women’s rights against deportations and in defense of black livesare seeing record numbers
2833,progressive political meetings lectures town halls and assemblies are experiencing beyondcapacity participation
2834,something powerful is at work and anyone who claims to know how far this can go should be trusted about as much as the pollsters who told us trump could never win and brexit would certainly fail
2835,building this broad tent in a time of siloed politics is hard work requiring a willingness to honestly confront painful histories before progress is possible
2836,and yet in this moment that combines such fearsome stakes with such fertile potential what choice do we have but to try
2837,to leap at every new opportunity as it opens
2838,for instance after the republicans’ first shot at dismantling obama’s health care program failed the movement calling for universal public health care surged across the country with the idea of medicareforall making more sense to more people than it had in decades
2839,now the push is on for the model to be adopted in large states such as california no matter what happens in washington
2840,as trump’s plans meet his surreal levels of ineptitude in executing them more such opportunities will emerge
2841,we can expect a similar shifting of the tectonic plates if the north american free trade agreement is opened up for renegotiation
2842,trump’s actions will be a bitter disappointment to his workingclass supporters but the very fact of reopening an agreement we were all told was sealed indefinitely will also be a chance for unions and environmentalists to step forward with a blueprint for genuinely fair trade and build support behind it
2843,each one of these openingsand there will be manyis an opportunity to get concrete about what a real alternative to rightwing populism can and should look like
2844,a plank in a true people’s platform
2845,just one last reminder trump’s disaster capitalists control a very powerful part of the us governmentbut they do not control everything
2846,they do not control what cities and states do
2847,they do not even control what congress does a lot of the time
2848,they certainly do not control what universities and faith institutions and unions do
2849,they do not control what the courts do yet
2850,they do not control what other sovereign nations do
2851,and they do not control what we do as individuals and in groups around the world
2852,precisely because what is happening in washington is so exquisitely dangerous what all of us do with our collective power in these non trumpified spaces matters now more than ever
2853,at the 2016 democratic national convention michelle obama memorably told the crowd that “when they go low we go high” she was talking less about deeds than about tone and her family’s refusal to join trump and his gang in the gutter
2854,it’s time to transfer that ethos from tone to deeds when they go low everyone needs to aim high
2855,in the many domains trump does not control we need to aim higher in our ambitions and accomplish more with our actions
2856,we need to do more to prevent catastrophic climate change
2857,we need to do more to create liberated cities for migrants and refugees
2858,we need to do more to prevent military escalation
2859,we need to do more to protect the rights of women and members of lgbtq communities
2860,as they go lower and lower we need to shoot higher and higher
2861,reverse shock for decades elites have been using the power of shock to impose nightmares
2862,donald trump thinks he’ll be able to do it again and again that we will have forgotten by tomorrow what he said yesterday which he will say he never said that we will be overwhelmed by events and will ultimately scatter surrender and let him grab whatever he wants
2863,but crises as we have seen do not always cause societies to regress and give up
2864,there is also the second optionthat faced with a grave common threat we can choose to come together and make an evolutionary leap
2865,we can choose as the reverend william barber puts it “to be the moral defibrillators of our time and shock the heart of this nation and build a movement of resistance and hope and justice and love” we can in other words surprise the hell out of ourselves by being united focused and determined
2866,by refusing to fall for those tired old shock tactics
2867,by refusing to be afraid no matter how much we are tested
2868,the corporate coup described in these pages in all its dimensions is a crisis with global reverberations that could echo through geologic time
2869,how we respond to this crisis is up to us
2870,so let’s choose that second option
2871,let’s leap
2872,postscript the leap manifesto a call for a canada based on caring for the earth and one another we start from the premise that canada is facing the deepest crisis in recent memory
2873,the truth and reconciliation commission has acknowledged shocking details about the violence of canada’s near past
2874,deepening poverty and inequality are a scar on the country’s present
2875,and canada’s record on climate change is a crime against humanity’s future
2876,these facts are all the more jarring because they depart so dramatically from our stated values respect for indigenous rights internationalism human rights diversity and environmental stewardship
2877,canada is not this place todaybut it could be
2878,we could live in a country powered entirely by renewable energy woven together by accessible public transit in which the jobs and opportunities of this transition are designed to systematically eliminate racial and gender inequality
2879,caring for one another and caring for the planet could be the economy’s fastestgrowing sectors
2880,many more people could have higherwage jobs with fewer work hours leaving us ample time to enjoy our loved ones and flourish in our communities
2881,we know that the time for this great transition is short
2882,climate scientists have told us that this is the decade to take decisive action to prevent catastrophic global warming
2883,that means small steps will no longer get us where we need to go
2884,this leap must begin by respecting the inherent rights and title of the original caretakers of this land
2885,indigenous communities have been at the forefront of protecting rivers coasts forests and lands from outofcontrol industrial activity
2886,we can bolster this role and reset our relationship by fully implementing the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples 
2887,moved by the treaties that form the legal basis of this country and bind us to share the land “for as long as the sun shines the grass grows and the rivers flow” we want energy sources that will last for time immemorial and never run out or poison the land
2888,technological breakthroughs have brought this dream within reach
2889,the latest research shows it is feasible for canada to get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable resources within two decades by 2050 we could have a 100 percent clean economy
2890,we demand that this shift begin now
2891,there is no longer an excuse for building new infrastructure projects that lock us into increased extraction decades into the future 
2892,the new iron law of energy development must be if you wouldn’t want it in your backyard then it doesn’t belong in anyone’s backyard 
2893,that applies equally to oil and gas pipelines fracking in new brunswick quebec and british columbia increased tanker traffic off our coasts and to canadianowned mining projects the world over
2894,the time for energy democracy has come we believe not just in changes to our energy sources but that wherever possible communities should collectively control these new energy systems
2895,as an alternative to the profitgouging of private companies and the remote bureaucracy of some centralized state ones we can create innovative ownership structures democratically run paying living wages and keeping much needed revenue in communities
2896,and indigenous peoples should be first to receive public support for their own clean energy projects
2897,so should communities currently dealing with heavy health impacts of polluting industrial activity 
2898,power generated this way will not merely light our homes but redistribute wealth deepen our democracy strengthen our economy and start to heal the wounds that date back to this country’s founding
2899,a leap to a nonpolluting economy creates countless openings for similar multiple “wins” we want a universal program to build energyefficient homes and retrofit existing housing ensuring that the lowestincome communities and neighbourhoods will benefit first and receive job training and opportunities that reduce poverty over the long term
2900,we want training and other resources for workers in carbonintensive jobs ensuring they are fully able to take part in the clean energy economy 
2901,this transition should involve the democratic participation of workers themselves
2902,highspeed rail powered by renewables and affordable public transit can unite every community in this country in place of more cars pipelines and exploding trains that endanger and divide us
2903,and since we know this leap is beginning late we need to invest in our decaying public infrastructure so that it can withstand increasingly frequent extreme weather events
2904,moving to a far more localized and ecologically based agricultural system would reduce reliance on fossil fuels capture carbon in the soil and absorb sudden shocks in the global supplyas well as produce healthier and more affordable food for everyone
2905,we call for an end to all trade deals that interfere with our attempts to rebuild local economies regulate corporations  and stop damaging extractive projects 
2906,rebalancing the scales of justice we should ensure immigration status and full protection for all workers 
2907,recognizing canada’s contributions to military conflicts and climate changeprimary drivers of the global refugee crisiswe must welcome refugees and migrants seeking safety and a better life
2908,shifting to an economy in balance with the earth’s limits also means expanding the sectors of our economy that are already lowcarbon caregiving teaching social work the arts and publicinterest media
2909,following on quebec’s lead a national childcare program is long past due 
2910,all this work much of it performed by women is the glue that builds humane resilient communitiesand we will need our communities to be as strong as possible in the face of the rocky future we have already locked in
2911,since so much of the labour of caretakingwhether of people or the planetis currently unpaid we call for a vigorous debate about the introduction of a universal basic annual income 
2912,pioneered in manitoba in the 1970s this sturdy safety net could help ensure that no one is forced to take work that threatens their children’s tomorrow just to feed those children today
2913,we declare that “austerity”which has systematically attacked lowcarbon sectors like education and healthcare while starving public transit and forcing reckless energy privatizationsis a fossilized form of thinking that has become a threat to life on earth 
2914,the money we need to pay for this great transformation is availablewe just need the right policies to release it
2915,like an end to fossil fuel subsidies
2916,financial transaction taxes
2917,increased resource royalties
2918,higher income taxes on corporations and wealthy people
2919,a progressive carbon tax
2920,cuts to military spending 
2921,all of these are based on a simple “polluter pays” principle and hold enormous promise
2922,one thing is clear public scarcity in times of unprecedented private wealth is a manufactured crisis designed to extinguish our dreams before they have a chance to be born
2923,those dreams go well beyond this document
2924,we call on all those seeking political office to seize this opportunity and embrace the urgent need for transformation
2925,we call for town hall meetings across the country where residents can gather to democratically define what a genuine leap to the next economy means in their communities
2926,inevitably this bottomup revival will lead to a renewal of democracy at every level of government working swiftly toward a system in which every vote counts and corporate money is removed from political campaigns 
2927,this is a great deal to take on all at once but such are the times in which we live
2928,the drop in oil prices has temporarily relieved the pressure to dig up fossil fuels as rapidly as highrisk technologies will allow
2929,this pause in frenetic expansion should not be viewed as a crisis but as a gift
2930,it has given us a rare moment to look at what we have becomeand decide to change
2931,and so we call on all those seeking political office to seize this opportunity and embrace the urgent need for transformation
2932,this is our sacred duty to those this country harmed in the past to those suffering needlessly in the present and to all who have a right to a bright and safe future
2933,now is the time for boldness
2934,now is the time to leap
