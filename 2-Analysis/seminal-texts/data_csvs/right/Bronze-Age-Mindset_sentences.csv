0,bronze age mindset an exhortation by bronze age pervert this book dedicated to the memory of dean dejana a spiritual brother a sardinian giant of high vision man of superhuman physical strength
1,you were too strong for this world friend
2,be reborn in a better timewe meet again we fight together
3,cover illustration by owen cyclops westernidentity victory to the gods
4,prologue this is not book of philosophy
5,it is exhortation
6,i hardly have anything to say to most who aren’t like me still less do i care about convincing
7,this is account of my reveries
8,i tried to put as brief and simple as i could the thought that motivates me and the problem faced by life in ascent and decline
9,i was convinced to write this book by certain frogs who told me “is it not a shame that hucksters are multiplying lies and jizzing their filthy doctrines into receptive minds everywhere
10,perversions lame onesare born by the thousands and haunt like myriad cripplette midgets in halls of mirrors they haunt the world books the internet
11,minds are lost
12,if you wait any longer everything will be pounded to garbage there will be nothing leftit will all turn the whole world will turn to a bulgarian rest stop lavatory
13,but have you seen the movie midnight express andand how did it make you feel” i was roused from my slumber by my frog friends and i declare to you with great boldness that i am here to save you from a great ugliness
14,if you look around eyes of some people you see a kind of demented energy
15,it’s pure anger or lust for power with nothing more
16,i hate to dirty these pages with mention of names of nobodies in our time
17,but if you see photo of hillary clintong or adam schiff with his eyes bugged out on stims and antidepressants or who knows what you know what i mean
18,there is a crease around the eye that tells it it looks like cyborg gone offscript these people have an inhuman gaze and are vehicles for something else
19,you see this also in the chiefs of the eu bureaucracy with tiny moleman eyes behind small glasses and the tiny lenses that reflect light
20,you see it in the dead robot eyes of the new hueman automatons running government departments the dmv the brutal zombies running the security in airports or hospital “health care” rooms under vicious yellow fluorescent lights
21,i wanted to expose the grim shadow of a movement that is hidden behind events of our time and from before
22,this is a great power that acts like a ghost
23,it hides in its own darkness and it has been absorbed by the lands and the peoples so that you can’t really see it anymore
24,there is just an eldritch quality embedded in things and on some faces
25,the same was said of hades
26,some said he would feel a great shame when some other god drew back the veil on the underworld so all the vile things that are there could be seen
27,is this hades of our time capable of shame
28,i heard also of such things being under the sea the disgusting and frightful things revealed when the sea recedes before a great storm
29,i will draw back the curtain on this iron prison and show you where it is you really live the secret things show in dreams
30,heraclitus say “all the things you see awake are death all the things you see asleep are sleep” he was trying to be coy
31,in his day many gods clovefooted satyr and other things showed themselves to men in dreams
32,spiritually your insides are all wet and there’s a huge hole through where monstrous powers are fucking your brain letting loose all your life and power of focus
33,you don’t see yourself as you really are but maybe some nightmare can show it to you
34,i am here to show you the way out
35,there was empedocles a philosopher man of high vision
36,he jumped into volcano aetna in sicily because he knew he would be reborn as a god
37,now imagine yourself in front of rim of aetna
38,it’s dry and sandy
39,you feel the heat but is not like you thought it might be
40,is not romantic
41,is just hot dry you can’t breathe and the smell of infernal sulfur and wet earth and even worse things triggers an old memory or instinct in you to run
42,you’re brought to face with a vehemence and brutality of rock and you start to feel dizzy staring in
43,molten rock in your nostrils and it’s not just that it scares you
44,if it were great fear that could be a spur to action
45,but it fills your nostrils with banality and dullness of plain molten dust you see gray and black
46,it reminds you of torrid summer afternoon by abandoned gas station you are stranded on dirt road choked by heat and so much dust
47,you see flames in the hole but it lacks the romance of fire as you imagined it
48,is this it
49,it seems like nothing to you because to your eye it’s nothing
50,so you pull away from it
51,you’re not reborn as a god you remain a mule
52,your lying mind now comes up with many thoughts about why it’s right to pull back
53,why of course
54,there’s a nice meal to have a glass of wine
55,maybe there’s a girl waiting
56,her pussy is warm and inviting
57,empedocles was deluded
58,no don’t jump in aetna or mauna loa or puyehue or eyjafjallajökull titans of the world even if you get yourself to do it it won’t work now
59,these portals are closed for ages
60,but
61,other doors are closed to you too
62,what mount aetna was to empedoclesis there something like that to you
63,is there something like that at all anymore
64,life has a thing inside it that reaches beyond itself
65,this is intergalactic worm i can’t say here you must wait
66,but if you don’t reach beyond yourself you are dead
67,most of mankind is the walking dead
68,i tell you other story
69,in stone age man appears very strong shoulders with club in hand
70,he is believed by the people to be a son of some godof a mortal woman who cucked her husband with a god
71,as child he already displays superhuman strength
72,when he grows he goes into the deepest wild to fight great cave lion
73,he emerges from cave with skin of lion on his back
74,lion had been eating and working terror in the people but now he wears this terror on his shoulders
75,he carries lion mane on head lion pelt on back and a great club in the hand
76,this man comes to be worshiped by the people his progeny become lines of kings of sparta and many other places
77,what was his act of foundation
78,he slaughtered monsters he made the seaways known to man and tamed the rock face
79,but don’t forget the lionskin on his shoulders
80,this was lion of nemea
81,do you understand what nemesis is
82,there is in nature a great purgative function
83,you know about monkeys who switch sex in certain times
84,in lake of some reptiles when they overpopulate it and there is a surplus of refuse there is trigger in nature a monster is born to them
85,a lizard many times the size of a normal one is born who deals out destruction and culls the lake
86,the greeks believed in this great power and worshiped its justice
87,in bible it appears as allegory of the flood which in fact refers to the irrepressible spirit of the sea peoples and the divine justice they brought to cities whose life had grown pointless and a great ugliness on the world
88,you bring lion cub into the house but aeschylus say it will become a priest of doom when it reaches age in nature there is irrepressible force
89,its violence against the surfeit of populations is divine justice
90,its destruction of the feeble designs of reason the pointless words of manthis is beautiful
91,this what the power of nemesis means few are chosen to wield it fewer realize they are chosen or know what to do with it
92,when hercules puts on the power of nemesis on his shoulders he becomes hero who makes the world tame and safe for cities of real men
93,but that was in his time and ours is an age of surfeit
94,it is different function
95,the star of nemesis is sure to return and it must already be burning inside some of you
96,in the bronze age men had life and force and i already see far on the horizon of our world but the glimmer is surely theremay it not be a mirage i see this spirit returning surely in our time
97,piratical bands and brotherhoods will take to the seas and not just to the seas
98,the enemies of western man and the enemies of beauty are to learn just what was meant by a piratical race a nest of pirates like the chinese thought of the dutch on first meeting them
99,i want to prepare you to receive this old spiritold spirits are moving from behind the reeds the silhouette shimmers against a river in late summer and i see already men who know how to honor such uncanny old friends
100,may they inhabit us again and give us strength to purify this world of refuse
101,part one the flame of life 1 what if you’ve been misled about what is life
102,they do this by showing you two red marionette and shake them in front then you stay mesmerized and clap like trained seal
103,is like in politics before last year
104,you had in years before trump the fat bald gluttons of the right put in a fighting ring against the janet renos the womyn with pickup trucks the thinlipped transnumales of the left
105,you had good people mesmerized even by this show and it’s funny to see a fat bald man try to tear out the eyes of woman of strong forearm with mullet both frothing at mouth
106,both saying nothing but grunts of pigs and premade platitude formula
107,but meanwhile the nation suffered and the future of youth was given away
108,when they trick you about what is life this even worse because you don’t see problem right away but then comes out sixty years later and your grandchildren don’t exist or they are 56 humanoid shifting about between shadows or they are of noble power but have to hide under half finished buildings because are hunted
109,but you must understand both left and right have been fooled about what is life
110,2 group of horses in broad plain and the lead stallion is captured by a wild spirit starts to gallop this way and that and the whole herd follows in a great rush of power and freedomnietzsche talks about this
111,i’ve seen many things like this myself was at big waterfall gathering place of many birds and other animal
112,through all the cycles of history this place remains and birds who witnessed the coming and going of human civilizations remember it through the aeons and always return there
113,i saw many group of small birds when the weather slightly changed this waterfall so big that a small wind would make spray of water everywhere
114,sun came from behind clouds and spread many small rainbows birds would become excited come out from crevasses in rock face and would glory in the sprays of water and the rainbows they swoon doing acrobatics this way and that
115,like when homer says that on some asian meadow tribes of geese and crane and longnecked swans glory in the power of their wings above it then land between the rivers in skamandrian plain with a great clang
116,is not enough just to say what is purpose of this to survival or reproduction
117,surely some pedant can make a story
118,but when you see this behavior is not so alien
119,maybe in happiest moments you were free to act and feel the same what anything to do with survival or reproduction
120,that kind of heavy necessity is the spirit of gravity and this is opposite
121,that petty and cramped view of lifebut in truth life as it is when free life in abundance knows luxury surfeit and wastesurvival and reproduction are side effects of something else 3 the most noble animals refuse to breed in captivity
122,many animal not just man choose death when trapped
123,but i thought all life strove for mere survival and reproduction but this not enough
124,but if not enough then must understand animal in some other way
125,very much when thinkers talk about “evolutionary psychology” they abstract from way of yeast to way of animals and man but this is backward
126,4 there’s a sociology of the world of scientists like of everything else
127,this is a cause of much confusion about biology and ideas of evolution
128,you think you’ve been given objective truth but the minds of biologists are in general very limited
129,the truth is the biggest minds always went for physics among the sciences then maybe chemistry
130,until recently but even now biology gives little opportunity for the kind of thinking that penetrates mystery of nature the kind of insight into physical relations that attracts the best scientific minds
131,they’ve been on the whole a halfandhalf group in history
132,schopenhauer refers with contempt to the people who have their “catalogues of monkeys” and think they understand nature
133,darwin himself nietzsche called him a petty mind the kind of calculator who likes to collect many small facts and synthesize some clumsy theory
134,the theory is clumsy and full of holes
135,this is the biggest reason creationists who are also wrong have been able to challenge it where they were never able to challenge theoretical physics
136,there is much dishonesty and stupidity among scientists and biologists when they talk about evolution and life
137,5 the problem now is you think i want to attaq idea of evolution or to change it because it’s racist or uncomfortable just like the left and others attaq or suppress it
138,this is not true
139,listen you don’t need darwin to believe in heredity and even evolution
140,people knew about heredity and the different lineages of man long before darwin
141,in the political sense the promotion of darwin teaching and its application to mankind is a great good
142,the left and its many robotsi will talk of their origin laterwant nothing more than to hide truth about human nature
143,and darwin evolutionary science in all its forms is a great weapon of truth against them
144,in all this i agree but remember the marionettes i mentioned
145,don’t be distracted by the puppet play
146,it is important not to be misled by a fierce debate with a stupid opponent into just accepting the only other alternative that is presented to you
147,although the left or what i have termed the bugman hates and fears evolutionary ideas applied to humans darwinism itself is the product of bugthought
148,in the end it won’t show you way out of the prison of the ages
149,the hereditary nature of the qualities and the suitability of an organism to its environment and viceversa all of this is true observation
150,and that true observation about heredity is in the end enough you don’t need more than that to utterly crush all the designs and vanities of the bugman
151,the bugman fears heredity and nature not darwin
152,6 you must understand that the evolutionary psychologist the evobiologist the darwinist in generalmost such people are very good and even great minds who are just misled by the fightplays a game of baitandswitch
153,many times he’s not aware he does this himself
154,he believes in darwinism as a teleological faith that reproduction and survival are the ends of life the purpose toward which all life strives and that this explains how life or an organism behaves and also how it is adapted to its environment
155,but when you confront him on this he will deny all notion of teleology
156,he will say he doesn’t believe in any of this but only in a material mechanism of natural selection
157,through this mechanism those organisms that are not in keeping with demands of environment at some time are slowly pared out
158,by a process analogous to our breeding of animals like dog and horse nature itself breeds organisms and life this way and that by accident
159,there is no end or purpose he will say you are crazy
160,but then when he’s not paying attention he will talk a different way
161,they all do this
162,he will start to say that this or that animal is behaving this or that way because it is trying to secure either reproduction or survival
163,he will explain physical features in this way too and when he really forgets himself he will make a moral principle out of it
164,the most honest ones when they trust you will talk about replicating themselves as an aspiration and a goal
165,this is human all toohuman but also very natural because it’s very hard to talk about biology or life without teleology or some consideration of ends or purpose
166,clearly physics and chemistry seem to be driven by no purpose or goal
167,but animals seem very much driven by motive or purpose and is hard to explain a biological feature without reference to its end or purpose
168,so the darwinist forgets or tries to change the topic all the time he knows what is really interesting is the question of what drives life what explains animal behavior and what explains the correspondence between organism and environment
169,this is the question
170,the mechanism of heredity or the means by which a species is shaped natural or unnatural selection which is really darwin’s only insight is the least interesting part of all
171,actually it is a tautology yes only those animals who have managed to reproduce actually pass on their traits
172,something every sheep breeder in history has known
173,but that this alone explains animal adaptation or behavior is nonsense
174,7 there is alpine mouse that collects food for winter
175,somehow it knows exactly the proportion of poison herbs to include in winter stores to preserve them
176,too much and the food it gathered becomes poison too little and it spoils
177,there is example schopenhauer gives two insects and one will kill the other on sight
178,yet this other presents no immediate danger to the first but will only eat its eggs in the future
179,how does that first insect know this
180,it is not taught nor does it see
181,it has very primitive nervous system
182,it knows this somehow “in the blood” this is a very specific and complicated behavior
183,there are many such cases in nature
184,creationists have focused too much on complicated physical features but even for something like the eye or the bacterial flagellum it is possible to construct stories of how they evolved gradually
185,i don’t believe those stories they sound improbable and madeup but they’re more believable than the stories you have to make up in the case of behaviors
186,and many more
187,so many animals and simple insects have such complicated behaviors they are born with already
188,at some point the incremental explanation becomes so convoluted it is hard to believe
189,please remember that aristotelianptolemaic system for calculating motion of planets and so on worked quite well for long time
190,it was abandoned because ever more convoluted explanations had to be invented to support the fundamental and wrong assumption of geocentric model
191,evolutionary theory today is slowly in same position and nowhere more than where they may try to explain inborn behaviors of this kind
192,it is obvious that such behaviorsif you want to call them “adaptations”came about as we see them now complete and without significant incremental change
193,how did such “miracle” occur
194,this is not creationist booki do not believe in that
195,nor do i believe in the “miracle” that modern science has invented hiding under the word “random mutation” and the handwaving of “incremental change” there is not enough time nor enough number of specimens nor the kinds of “mutations” observed to support either natural selection or lamarckianism as explanations for evolution
196,many of the mathematical models for how a trait will spread in a population have failedthey don’t tell you this
197,no i don’t talk about miracles whatever words you put them under
198,and the “design” is there but it is by no means benevolent or intelligent nor comprehensible
199,you see in the spider’s web a creature of rudimentary nervous system and little intelligence “design” something beautiful and complex and this is key to understanding also all of nature
200,there is an inherent “intelligence” inside things uncanny silent and demonic
201,its workings and aims are obscure to us
202,our own intelligence is only a crude deviation of it an approximation
203,there is an “intelligence” in all things and inborn in our bodies before anything to do with the brain or the nervous system
204,and all “adaptations” no matter how much natural or unnatural selection may have gone to spreading them within a population occur not by random but by a spontaneous correspondence of some kind between the organism and the environment
205,some day we may discover the material cause or manifestation of this correspondence or the chain by which it travels from the rockface and the elements of brute matter up the forms of lifethere is some asyet undiscovered “signaling” system
206,but the adaptation by no means takes place at random nor even primarily by natural selection which is just one of the means by which it spreads in a population
207,8 a truly objective or scientific approach to life would be to start without assumptions
208,make no big stories
209,take animal and study
210,study what it does in nature not lab when left alone from human
211,study different specimens the mood the behavior at different time of year in different places at different levels of fortune and wellbeing
212,make no assumption about what it wants ultimately study how it behave today tomorrow in the moment which is only thing that exists for animal
213,look inside its brain
214,study its hormones and its internal states with great care and with clinical objective eye correlate these internal states to what it does or what it’s driving atand driving at that day or in that moment not what you think about “reproduction or survival” this is true path to understand animal adaptation behavior and life
215,there is some of this done but much too little and not well
216,in the end are you so different from goat dog or even ant that you look at such beings and really remain puzzled
217,for sure the real research i just named must be done if only to convince the boneheads
218,but the behavior of an animal would be a complete mystery to you if you weren’t very similar yourself but we understand right away a bear angry at bees or playing under whitesilver birch in thick of forest or lizard frightened and winding between rocks why it does what it does
219,it is no mystery to us who are also like them
220,we love dogs because they express so honestly and without dissimulation what we also are and want
221,they and other pets calm us because promote a kind of carelessness normal to animal life unencumbered by thoughts of the past or worries about the future none of which actually exist
222,women are in their natural state close to this condition as well or closer on the whole which is where they get much of their charm and power from the modern education that teaches women to be hyperaware anxious for the future abstract neurotics etc actually takes away their power to a great degree while tricking them into thinking they are being tough or sassy but a hyperconscious woman is made powerless and charmless
223,but study must be made of inner state of animal now in this condition now that
224,what anyway would objective study of an organism say
225,what does life want
226,9 darwin and his style of thinking would never have made so much impression or ever had such power if it were simply false
227,actually darwinism is true but only under certain conditions
228,it’s not even a “halftruth” it’s actually the full truth about a kind of life but the mistake is to think it describes all life
229,darwin is meaningless without malthus but this is why nietzsche is right about both of them when he says they describe only life in england or more precisely the england of that time
230,the beginning of the industrial age and england as the first nation that solved the problem of infant mortality these are the relevant facts
231,england was able to colonize so much of the new world because it was the first country to solve this problem
232,many criticize in some way the spanish or portuguese model of colonization but you must know the portuguese had a population of one million when they began the age of discovery with henry the navigator
233,and of that population many fewer were young men who could embark on voyages of great danger some say up to a fourth or more died on these voyages alone
234,they had no manpower to settle faraway lands but continued the old pattern of “elite dominance” where brotherhoods of conquering men often took local wives and such
235,by contrast the english could now transplant entire populations being surfeit of huemans
236,but it was still not enough
237,the cities became crowded the filth unbearable as the lowest classes swarmed the monstrous new machines of industry
238,the living conditions of workers well into the 20 th century were purely hellish marx and his followers at least were right about that and that’s why they could prey on this condition
239,it was a condition of misery and destitution similar to or worse than we see in the shantytowns of the turd world
240,solution to infant mortality problem meant these lower classes put all excess income into supporting more mouths to feed not improving the quality of life of the children they had just an exponential increase in human biomass
241,and this is the world of malthus and of darwin life under filth life under distress
242,darwinism describes life under extreme stress
243,from this very partial view he thinks he has discovered the truth about life in general but animal under conditions of extreme stress crowded condition observed and watched filthy beaten and imprisoned its life severely regimented away from what it would like to do if left to its devices will not give you secret to what life is
244,it will be very misleading example and this is basis of darwinism and of all thought that comes from it
245,it is the philosophy of life of the tenement and the slum of the open air workcamp
246,10 no kind of distress is worse than the feeling you are trapped
247,my worst nightmares are about opening a door only to find myself in the same aluminum cell over and over
248,the exhaustion that sets in after a long night of chess when you sleep and your mind dreams repeat nonsense moves i know of few worse forms of torment
249,and this is selfimposed through exhaustion but even worse is when an outside force or being restrains you yet you are in full control of your spirits and power at least to begin with
250,that condition is intolerable for the most noble animals who choose death if necessary or at least any way to escape no matter how painful
251,many caribs trapped into slavery died because they couldn’t endure this some bit through their arms to escape their chains and endured any pain to escape captivity
252,germanic mothers would kill infants when roman legions closed in tacitus describe life of germanic warrior who lived his whole life dedicated to war and fame never became a domestic
253,at masada and at other times the jews killed their own children to escape subjection when they were still a noble people
254,xenophon describes in anabasis how mother with infant would jump off a cliff in the highlands of urartu to escape the advance of the greek army we see same videos in japan in okinawa mother jump off cliff
255,buddhist monks vietnam selfimmolated and brought great shame on the west
256,for this reason nietzsche say noble peoples do not endure slavery they’re either free or they die out
257,there is no “adaptation” to slavery for some types of life
258,what is that people who has chosen survival at any price
259,the price they paid was monstrous and such a people becomes monstrous and distorted if it accepts this
260,the distinction between master races and the rest is simple and true hegel said it copying heraclitus those peoples who choose death rather than slavery or submission in a confrontation that is a people of masters
261,there are many such in the world not only among the aryans but also the comanche many of the polynesians the japanese and many others
262,but animal of this kind refuses entrapment and subjection
263,it is very sad to witness those times when such animal can neither escape nor kill itself
264,i saw once a jaguar in zoo behind a glass so that all the bugs in hueman form could gawk at it and humiliate it
265,this animal felt a noble and persistent sadness being observed everywhere by the obsequious monkeys not even monkeys that were taunting it with stares
266,he could telli saw this
267,he could tell he was living in a simulated environment and that he had no power to move or live
268,his sadness crushed me and i will always remember this animal
269,i never want to see life in this condition
270,11 just a few weeks ago i was outside night club in city that is still untouched by firstworld regimented hygiene welllighted clean streets made safe for women come at a high price for the mood of a city
271,in this place the government and bureaucracy couldn’t extend its rules and cleanup efforts even if it wanted
272,there are then many nooks and hidden corners that are under no one’s control
273,in this noman’s land there is mafia so many perverts there is some crime but it’s kept at mostly very low or nonviolent level because place is full of offduty cops on the make and no doubt spooks foreign and domestic and who knows what else
274,i find life without such refuge to be almost intolerable so here i felt free but i think was after day in a haze and the glycine was kicking in
275,i must have taken 600 mg theanine as well and after much coffee i was spacing out under vicious neon yellow lights i stood looking at the bouncer almost in a trance
276,i wondered what it was like to be him
277,he was alert knew what posture to take for his job and what look in the eye to emulate or put on an act of being vigilant and was imposing in broad frame under leather jacket with militarytype epaulettes but there was a kindness or softness in his eyes
278,maybe would have taken some power of perception to see this and i doubt he was challenged often by the customer riffraff because of it but i could see it how at times he sunk into a sadness and boredom looking in the distance
279,i too looked down the long broad street mostly empty except for some small groups of drunks hookers some revelers in the distance there was great fountain in plaza lighted up on all sides
280,i don’t know why maybe the calmness of the blessed aminos hit me but my gaze veered off to one of the apartment buildings on the side of the road
281,there was just one light turned on in the middle of building and my mind wandered to who lived there and what they were like and then to how it would be if i was the boy or girl who lived there
282,many times i’ve wished not so much that i was someone else nor that i was immortal but that i could live many different lives simultaneously and not be limited to being only one thing
283,at such moments of mood where you’re both calm and at least feel free every detail of life becomes interesting all takes the character of images from a peaceful dream that present themselves in turn and don’t move you one way or another because you see through them
284,i wonder then at least as a zoological experiment what it would be like to be a vietnamese girl a nail shop owner or even an obese angolan middleaged woman running a pedicure operation with pink wallsyes no form of hueman life is beneath me at such moments
285,i’ve even had dreams that i was a door or a vase free to observei imagine only the seeing the satisfaction of curiosity and not the thousands of cares that must affect these people who i want to inhabit
286,but most of all then when to this love of curiosity is added some sudden burst of energy i start to wonder about men like myself of around my age and what it would be like to be them what they think moment to moment what pulls them this way and that
287,i feel then a great longing for them and also for myself and think of the friendships that i could have had with them and the great tasks that could await
288,i feel beset by this as an almost erotic irritation that is diffuse and a great sadness and irritation that i will never know who lived in that building at that window never see what they saw looking out
289,these waysthis is all my version of “love for mankind” of the other abstract kind it means nothing and those who invoke it are bullshitters
290,12 very young rams very young stag even when fawn well before horns appear playfight with heads butting
291,this is in anticipation of horns that will grow
292,yet no one teaches them this but they know it in the blood
293,what came “first” for this animal the development of horns or the “knowledge” and will to fight in this manner
294,in phenomenon like this is kept the secret and truth about evolution and life
295,13 struggle for space a healthy animal not under distress not maimed not trapped by man seeks first when young space
296,animal seeks space in physical sense territory
297,but this meaning isn’t crudely physical i give this as vivid image which is true for many animals that seek ownership of concrete territory
298,but more generally you must take it to mean something else space to develop inborn powers
299,monkey that lives in trees seeks skills to master canopy beaver seeks ownership of river and banks and reeds in its grasp many big cat of course seek mastership of actual territory and claims to prey and mates in this territory
300,big feline hunting dogs seek full use of claws fangs development of smell and other senses to extend their reach over space
301,they seek these things because they want to master matter
302,all of this is higher organism organizing itself to master matter in surrounding space
303,successful mastery of this matter leads to development of inborn powers and flourishing of organism which allows it to master more matter to marshal the lower to feed the higher
304,it is mobilization of matter to develop the inborn character or idea or fatethis true not only for food literally
305,in social animals an analogous process takes place within social relations or social “space” there are some important changes that happen here but principle is same
306,important to understand that there is a circular process organism seeks mastery of space environment to master matter in ways particular to its own abilities and as a result of this mastery of matter there is development of its body its senses and all of its faculties and the unfolding of its inborn destined form or nature in time its particular form flowering in the spring of its season
307,all of this requires precisely freedom from struggle for survival or time away from this a reprieve from this pressure
308,as for reproduction animal in natural state will not even seek at this point will not even think it
309,very far from its aims it seeks to become strong skillful to master problems and feel the expansion of its powers and not just feel them but perceive it to be truly so perceive intuitively its mastery over its space
310,only after full development of its powers and its mastery over space specific to its needs does the need or desire for reproduction come
311,reproduction is side effect of animal desire for discharge of strength after mastery over space is achieved
312,for this reason many lower animal breed very fast and in great hurry but the higher and more organized the form of life the more complex its needs for development are the longer is delayed the time of reproduction and the more vulnerable it is to the stresses of competition for survival
313,animals that have “evolved” under intense competition are in some sense “stunted” less beautiful less intelligent less magnificent
314,there are many “factions” in nature and many paths that pull in opposite directions
315,you must learn to see the secret language of nature and what it drives at there is one path that drives for the production of a supreme specimen
316,it is the path that governs higher life survival and reproduction are only side effects of this path
317,life is at most basic struggle for ownership of space
318,14 some things make my blood boil far more than a direct physical challenge might
319,i once left the gym and some chad came up to me and started to feel me up
320,then i discovered he was feeling up my pockets was trying to see if someone stole his missing stuff
321,i found this very amusing
322,maybe was post workout and i was very calm but was not offended by this partly his manner was not obtrusive despite what he was doing
323,it was possibly a form of muscle worship
324,but rarely do i feel angrier as a violation of my privacy than if i eat in restaurant alone and someone comes to sit right next to me when the whole place is empty
325,vilest of all is when a group of something i think were subcons or han came and sat just by me in entirely empty restaurant and started to eat with mouths open
326,that sound too fewer things grate on the nerves and present themselves as imposition on your space than the sound of socalled hueman eating
327,other animals making sound eating don’t bother me but i find charming
328,different types even within same grouping of animalsi refuse the word species have very different needs of life
329,my blood starts to boil against my kindness and judgment even when i stay with gril and she insists on setting air conditioner off or closing window because “too cold” i like open spaces and slightly cool and there can be no living together with creatures who like a huddled and overwarm existence
330,i believe also the white race or rather some groupings within itthere are far more races than people want to admitis in general hostile to the way of life of the tribes that like a closepacked existence
331,these are biological requirements of this or that way of life and no laws no common beliefs can bring such different types together
332,a hybrid of such types would probably be born and remain physiologically confused or sick
333,15 whoremoans energy and higher life the same if we had very advanced sensors where we could observe the inside of animals from far and in great detail without interfering without them feeling irritated or oppressed by our impositions we could learn much about what life means
334,from observing many different ones in different places we could see what conditions an animal seeks in life in general
335,such sensors would need to be much more advanced than equipment we have now and to show what parts of the brain are activated to see the relationship of this to blood pressure and heart rate the actions of the immune system the level of various inflammatory and antiinflammatory markers and most of all the balance and action of the various hormones on the body’s systems on the brain and how these correlate to what the animal is doing at any one time
336,any information we have right now on this subject is at most rudimentary
337,the medical literature is confused is presented with great confidence but is corrupted by money career and other interests of all kinds
338,the scientific literature is less known and itself remains contradictory
339,we know at most a few relations of what say elevated thyroid or cortisol means at such and such time of day and its multiple effects on various body tissues and systems
340,we have no real overall understanding of how such things interact nor what they mean for the body’s overall processes still less in the life of an organism as a whole and the few who have attempted to achieve such understanding like ray peat are treated as cranks
341,but it’s not possible to understand what life means nor what an organism drives at nor what any specific behavior or physical adaptation means until this is taken up
342,if biologists had been honest people they would have tried to proceed in this way without assumptions just amassing observations about different organisms in different situations
343,but they did this only very little and it’s always distorted by their various agendas and prejudices
344,the data we have itself is therefore at this point much too sparse and it will take decades to get what is needed even if researchers begin now
345,it will be a genius of the ages who will really be able to understand and explain the complete view of how hormones act in an organism
346,there is no irony here i don’t do irony
347,learn that i don’t understand the gay idea of “irony” hormones hold the key to the meaning of life in the most fundamental way and if this sounds “reductionist” to you if you think i demystify things too much it’s because you think you know what you don’t or you think scientists know when they actually don’t
348,these substances seen with fresh eyes are pure big magic
349,they govern all cycles of an organism’s growth and its decay
350,they can turn small calf or baby gorilla into giant elephant or half ton silverback on diet of greens they can turn skinny man into herculean half god or make strong man take on the aspect of woman and change tendencies and feelings mirroring the magical transformation of some animals that switch sexes by signals we don’t yet understand
351,this doesn’t even begin to cover the different meanings of thyroid progesterone the various neurotransmitters and many others that act one way on the nervous system another way on the gut another way on the immune system that govern cell division and the preservation of function in ways that are for the moment a mystery to doctors and to science
352,only a complete understanding of these hidden substances will reveal the fullness of life in its glory
353,the study of life as a “black box” has led to misunderstandings because the observers are dishonest and stupid and will report an action but not what comes before or after nor its place in the life of an animal nor do they try to intuit from within themselves the study of hormones among many other internal processes of an organism will prevent them from lying in this way
354,for example an animal may act one way under stress and pressure but then appear to do the same action out of a spirit of openness and selfincrease and the same action or behavior may actually have completely different meanings biologically this will be shown by actions of hormones neurotransmitters cytokines in the body
355,and i will tell you what they likely to discover
356,so far only ray peat a man blessed by a grand and alien understanding has tried to decipher the secret language of these blessed substances
357,learn that there are at least two kinds of life
358,usually you think of life versus inanimate matterhow strange that the most primitive languages the agglutinative grunts of neanderthals like basque distinguish not between gender of noun but between animate and inanimate
359,i wonder then what they would call yeast
360,learn that there are two kinds of life and yeast is different from higher life
361,higher life means many fancy and mysterious things too of course but at its most basic it has to do with differentiation and structure
362,yeast is an “amorphous blob” that expands whereas a higher organism has different parts with different functions different organs different systems within itself
363,the sexes are different because it reproduces sexually and some have taken this to be the main distinction asexual versus sexual reproduction
364,but it’s obvious that “differentiation” in higher organisms goes much beyond this
365,and to preserve the function of the different organs and different systems within itself an organism sacrifices the ability to expand and replicate indiscriminately like yeast does for example
366,you can think of it as “sacrifice” of this ability or just say that these two modes or tendencies expansion and replication of cells on one hand and preservation of higher or differentiated function on the other are at odds with each other
367,they are governed by different hormones and neurotransmitters where estrogen and serotonin are “stress” substances that govern cell division but thyroid and progesterone are those that govern the preservation of function
368,it is not correct to call estrogen then a “sex hormone” but a stress hormone and its greater proportion in body of female is because female is under greater stress due to demands of inner cell division and menstruation
369,the picture is far from complete of course but this leads to many good observations
370,considering this from the other side the side of pathology the indiscriminate cell division the return of “primitive life” within the human body is called cancer which looks and acts very much like a fungus does
371,conversely from the side of health the structure of the body is preserved to the extent that cells successfully command energy and so to speak artistically but to be right on one side the hormones that promote cell energy are precisely those that promote the preservation of function namely thyroid and the like whereas the hormones that promote “lassitude” and that take away energy are precisely those that promote cell division inflammation the production of free radicals the breakdown in order and function
372,at a deep level this must be connected to the fundamental truth of nature that structure and energy must be the same that energy is not as “diffuse” as we imagine it but has an inner “intelligence”this word is very bad in this case because it is rather the imperfect intellect of our brains that is a mere approximation of this primordial and primal will
373,this will is almighty
374,its forms are endless
375,it is no different from the fire of heraclitus a pervasive energy at play inside all things that seeks to order and reorder itself into ascending uncanny objects
376,its intent is mischievous and beyond our ability to understand in words
377,in the life of organisms this seeks to order itself into higher and more differentiated forms that is concretely seeks the production of one supreme specimen
378,peoples are nature’s circuitous ways to great specimens and for this reason the peoples that have arisen out of nature must be preserved in their distinct forms
379,in same way see from all this that aesthetic physique has the most cosmic significance and it is because of what i have said so far that aesthetic bodies are a “window to the other side” because they are the pinnacle of nature
380,the gods that surely exist but remain hidden have the most beautiful bodies we can imaginethey appeared to the ancient greeks in dreams
381,contrary to this exists the surfeit of flesh we see on the obese and in general the lassitude the spiritual obesity not only of modern life but of many historical forms of life as well the domestic life of the village of the village sewer of the fetid valleys of matriarchy and domestics of slaves the pollution of cities built on filth the life of the swamp the life of the human animal collapsed to mere life life for the sake of life as it devolves to the yeast form aesthetically morally intellectually physically
382,on the other side is the life of the immortal gods who live in pure mountain air and the sign of this life where energy is marshaled to the production of higher order is the aesthetic physique the body in its glorious and divine beauty
383,what of the mind then
384,well as rare as beautiful bodies are the mind in the same condition is even more rare
385,let us strive in our decrepit cancerous and fetid world for what is concrete and what we can try to attain
386,those who forget the body to pursue a “perfect mind” or “perfect soul” have no idea where to even start
387,only physical beauty is the foundation for a true higher culture of the mind and spirit as well
388,only sun and steel will show you the path
389,16 chimp in state of nature never jerks off but in captivity he does wat does this mean
390,in state of nature he’s too busy to put plainly
391,he is concerned with mastering space solving problem of life in and under trees mastering what tools he can mastering social relations in the jockeying for power and status
392,deprived of this drive to development and selfincrease he devolves to pointless masturbation in captivity where he senses he is in owned space and therefore the futility of all his efforts and all his actions
393,the onanism of modern society is connected with its supposed “hypersexualization” and its infertility
394,it’s not really hypersexualization but the devolution of the spirit to the lassitude of a diffuse and weak sexuality
395,life in owned space becomes drained of energy through lowgrade pointless titillationand nofap is a kind of cargo cult that tries to reestablish energy in order on path of ascent
396,sometimes however it’s a successful cargo cult but whether it works or no can be seen usually within a week
397,the unfortunate thing about all this is that wmn have exceptionally good antennae for this kind of thing and when a man frees himself from these pressuresthey see this from very far away
398,they have an instinct to seek out ascending life and drain itthey and the species thereby achieve their goals but you are bled dry and sometimes left a husk
399,they revert life back to its irritated state and by their drainage of vital essence they’ve laid low many great tasks
400,17 i’ve always been attracted to filth and dirt because something in me knew intuitively that it is only in the underseam of life as it exists today that you find the real “lacunae” the “holes” where its reach is limited or weak
401,i always sensed there was some real freedom in the blackest of red light districts among whores and junkies perverts and worse with whom i’ve always chosen to take my dinners when i had the chance
402,i like the stories they told me some showed letters from delusional spanish engineer who wanted to marry her another told me story of miscarriage her friend had in old pervert’s bathroom and how they flushed it down a toilet and then its name written on a piece of toilet paper
403,it’s in this world and almost only in this world today that you can start to polish the claws nature gave you assuming it gave you any
404,unfortunately it’s easy for a man with good antennae to see that even this world of shadows has at most a conditional existence
405,the truth is that they are allowing these “holes” because they or the people who crafted the fabric in which the masters of lies operate are smart enough to know you need these “free spaces” they are of great use to a manipulator
406,see how the japanese so famed for their love of law and order have nevertheless always allowed the yakuza to operate running prostitution and meth rings and even worse
407,such things have a serious function in japanese society as the mafia and other institutions have had in western society
408,only a cretinous government will get rid of such a world entirely and thankfully we have very stupid governments in the west now
409,their days are numbered
410,it is with sadness that you realize eventually after the first exhilarating rush of freedom in this world of the damned that these spaces too though not so pervasively “owned” have portals and gates manned by that which owns everything else
411,still it’s better than nothing because in the moment all of that’s still far away on a late summer night when you are asked by corrupt lawyer to spy on lebanese strip club owner and you’re out in courtyard with 20yearold prostie she put cocaine on your tongue and you feel the ocean air at night fill you with the longing of the great sea
412,you might almost forget suffocating air of gravity outside and feel for a few minutes like animal before moment of hunt
413,18 when speak of whoremoans you might think i’m a materialist reductionist or am saying you are like machine
414,this is attitude of many scientists or maybe just cultists of science
415,actually many on the left claim to have this attitude though they can never explain what moral force their “rights” and “compassion” have if it doesn’t come from god or have some reality in human nature
416,when they say they are atheists i never believe them atheists act like stalin or brezhnev not like a presbyterian schoolmarm
417,the truth is that these who make the core of the modern left are moral fanatics
418,there’s not a drop of atheism or relativism in them
419,they don’t enjoy the clear air of skepticism and never have
420,they always sneak in the soul or free will when you’re not looking
421,they actually get off on this and are acting out of spite even spite against themselves
422,they want to feel they’re not in control “my hormones made me do it” what is this you apart from your hormones your genes your inborn instinct then
423,“it’s the genes” “it’s the environment” “it’s the economy or the oppression”all versions of the milieu theory a neurotic’s theory according to nietzsche
424,this is how they can also get themselves to believe in the transgender these are people who believe that matter can somehow be corruptly configured and that we all have disembodied souls with male or female essences
425,the whole attempt to redefine identity not just sexual identity as a matter of decision meaning decision made arbitrarily freely a choice of the intellect or reason is their desperate reach to find a new justification for the freedom of the will the soul unrestrained by nature or biology
426,such things make no sense when you realize you’re your body and there’s no you aside from this
427,the first lines of the iliad make this clear you do have a “soul” of sorts apart from your bodyit just isn’t you
428,it’s a shade
429,it’s completely homosexual
430,19 some think this view absolves you of your responsibility for your acts
431,but actually you’re responsible for much more than your acts
432,that which is said to constrain or determine you biologically is actually what you are
433,it does restrain your acts according to its inherent ways of desiring and acting but you are this it and it decided to be so actually you are responsible for much more you’re responsible for what you are
434,you are responsible for the good and bad things that happen to you for any accident or disease you might experience
435,actually it was all going to happen to you just the way it did at the moment of your birth or conception and even before at the moment your parents had a glint for each other in the eye
436,there is fundamentally no difference between you and that glint
437,20 animals walk around in a state of permanent religious intoxication
438,this is the natural condition of the mind and intellect the momenttomoment perception of man as well
439,i heard some computer fool say that religion is the “older virtual reality” experience to justify his scam industry
440,no the denuded state of the spirit and intellect where you walk around “demystified” and “disenchanted” is the virtual reality condition and a terrible condition at that
441,for the longest period of which we are at present aware for hundreds of thousands of years in the paleolithic humans walked around like healthy animal in a state that we would today call religious delirium but which is in fact the default state of all conscious and semiconscious life
442,for long after the coming of civilization also many continued in this condition or did so during special times of the year or festivals where man could regain his free and natural state
443,it was civilization and in particular agricultural civilization that forbad this condition and plunged the majority of humans into a semipermanent repressive or depressive frame
444,that this is consistent with and even a prerequisite for the impressive works and development of higher civilization and higher culture shouldn’t be surprising the majority of mankind suffered terribly also in their bodies from the coming of agriculture the backbreaking labor the malnourishment that shows itself in the smaller stature and more slender build of farmers’ skeletors of the destruction of their teeth the atrophy of their brains and other organs
445,agriculture allowed a steady food source an increase in numbers and above all the maintenance of an elite free from these exactions that lived parasitically on the many
446,but agriculture broke the human animal and domesticated him
447,do you understand then what the “disenchanted” worldview is
448,i have to laugh at the “secular worldview” the disenchanted worldview which is in fact the worldview or mood of the broken peasant farmer
449,“science” supposedly the contentthat’s not even relevant here 21 my favorite thing is to walk around the city during the day completely plastered on very crowded streets or on boardwalk by sea or river with container maybe it looks like iced tea or water but is full of alcohol
450,at night i don’t enjoy as much but during the day to walk around in a state of great enthusiasm and energy powered by liquor or best of all some kind of wine that energizes you to a great and holy rage
451,i don’t mean really rage because i’m laughing on the inside but i love to walk around like this to see the people to accost strangers in all kinds of ways nothing is more entertaining
452,i’ve often wondered at these times what it would be like and how blessed life would be if i could feel this way all the time and not just when i drink and also never pay the price for it
453,alcohol should never by the way be used for stress relief because after it crashes and even the next day there is a rise in cortisol so that unpleasant feelings become worse
454,but i wondered what it would be like to feel like this all the time and that there must be or have been people who do
455,aren’t we told this world is full of mutants
456,why not a mutant who is perpetually full of this kind of euphoriabut even more why not just one set of emotions or one emotion
457,i’ve wondered at these times how life could be if you were possessed only by one specific feeling and if there is a man who has only felt the purest and most intense anger continually and nothing else or who has felt only a very specific kind of joy and no other feelingeven sadness of certain kinds makes life beautiful and can be a spur to great things
458,even panic is better than the numbness promoted in our time
459,what would a creature who only ever felt such a thing be like and why can’t one exist
460,it would be a monster or a god or in any case he would be possessed by a god
461,22 do you imagine that men of genius or let’s say men of science in history walked around clearheaded “disenchanted” reasonable with the tightassed attitude of the science cultist and materialist
462,no great discovery has ever been made by the power of reason
463,reason is a means of communicating imperfectly some discoveries to others and in the case of the sciences a method of trying to render this communication certain and precise
464,but no one ever made a discovery through syllogisms through reason through this makeshift form of transmission
465,great mathematicians saw spatial relations as great physicists saw and to some extent felt physical relations
466,in contemplation of mathematical forms there is almost a physical feel of geometric relations and all mathematics at bottom is about geometric relations even when it doesn’t seem so
467,compare the euclidian proof of the pythagorean theorem based on syllogism which helps you understand nothing that’s actually going on with the imagistic proof of the three squares that makes you perceive physically perceive even in your body why this theorem is true
468,gauss so beloved even by the tedious scientistic goblins that even google gave him a cartoon is famous to have said something like “i got itnow i have to get it” meaning he had seen and felt the fundamental spatial relation he was searching but now he had to translate it into the imperfect language of mathematics for others
469,thus all mathematics and all science in generalmathematics is only the prototype and most precise of the sciencesis about the definitions not about the proof not about the process or absurdthe “algorithm” all great scientific discoveries supposedly the great works of “reason” are in fact the result of intuitions and sudden grasp of ideas
470,and all such sudden grasp and reaching is based on what in other circumstances would be called a kind of religious intoxication it depends on a state of the mind where the perceiving part of the intellect is absolutely focused limpid yet driven by the most relentless energy an energy to penetrate
471,direct perception is already “intellectualized” and in fact much closer to the innate “intelligence” of things than cerebral syllogisms
472,no scientist worth anything has ever felt pride at using algorithms or trialanderror to solve a problem
473,yes feminists are right that “science” is patriarchal in this sense that it is a “rape” of nature
474,real scientists like galois are monsters of will and the preponderance of men in the hard sciences is explained by this orientation of character as also by the fact that the minds of men more than of women are capable of sustained focus on one thing women are better at multitasking
475,there are women who were great scientists but like women who were great chess players or poets they are probably spiritual lesbians
476,23 the modern peasant just replaces the artificial prejudices of superstitions and village old wives’ tales with the superstitions of science which he receives readymade from authorities among the popularizers of science
477,he loves them because of the creature comforts he believes they provide through technology
478,he is a cargo cultisthe knows nothing of what goes into the discoveries of science nor the way the substance is transmitted among scientists he just has a propagandized image of some of the results
479,this is no different from belief in big magic which is how many primitives think of sciencethe big magic of the white man
480,it’s not even the substance of science that is the problem because it could be of great use as much as any other popular religion has been the problem is the frame of spirit that it puts the acolyte in
481,it makes him think he has power over the processes of nature which are at present actually very poorly understood
482,by removing primal fearthe only kind of awe that drives the many it injects a toxic mix of complacency arrogance brutality fanaticism that is all just under the surface only so long as times are good
483,science as popular religion brings no true consolation but instead feeds a kind of false pride pride in spiting oneselfdoes this sound familiar
484,it should sound familiar to women most of all
485,it actually makes the many more servile to the authorities who are presumed to understand and manipulate the technology
486,that is its purpose to make the many submit which wouldn’t be bad if they weren’t submitting to the lords of lies
487,you can see from all this anyway why enlightenment can never happen but also why those critics of enlightenment like most of the followers of heidegger go the wrong way
488,they are right when they say in so many words that the inborn character of every man is in some way unique the biology too particular much more so than the more uniform character of animals
489,for animals the worker ant or two fruitflies will have exactly the same inborn but humans are all slightly different
490,from this they draw the conclusion that no common “way” can suffice for all but that the only authentic way for you can come from the needs of your inner self
491,every adherence to an external code religion or ideology is “inauthentic” and represents essentially a form of mind control your adopting the thoughts of another inappropriate for your own metabolism biology peculiar conditions for growth or flourishing
492,yes it is true nietzsche went so far as to avoid reading anything written by others so as not to infect his mind
493,and he was a mutant with a very particular biology such types often are and he was right that for them physiology diet may be the most pressing research necessary
494,but he never forgot that the fundamental fact of nature is inequality and this is something these people the followers of heidegger and heidegger himself to a great degree all forget
495,it is madness to ask the common prefab run of man to fashion his own way his own “religion” the many find solace and meaning only in submission
496,it is good that this is so and they shouldn’t be made to feel ashamed for it
497,so much of the modern idiocy is based on shaming those who would find true pleasure in submission
498,the long chain of being is held together by command and obedience
499,the many are not so different from one another nor their conditions of life so different
500,in the end you too no matter how special or a genius you may be are held together to the average man through many ties of biology so that you would both do well to pay attention to what is common especially insofar as the body is concerned
501,the body is not a private thing the “individual” body is likely diseased
502,the universal body the correct type discovered by ancient greek science and art is not something you will develop by nurturing your own “individual” quirks doxies and faggotries
503,biology works according to types and grades of manifestation not according to the development of “unique” personal eccentricities
504,science rightly understood helps us understand the types the species the true cleavages of nature
505,science is not in and of itself the cause of our problems of your “alienation” nor does it have any content beyond who uses it and for what
506,science is a great tool because it can uncover for us the biological conditions of all life and the relationships between types of life
507,it can as nietzsche predicted settle the question of the true hierarchy of values or more precisely the real ladder of life the true hierarchy of biological types
508,what prevents this from happening is not inherent to science or technology as such
509,it is a political and sociological problemone way or another in time the right force will take hold of the power of science and reveal its true potential
510,science was never meant to be for comfort
511,24 i don’t talk about if god exists i don’t know this
512,i’ve never had any feeling for this one way or another
513,i’ve sat in houses of religions but i always felt nothing it put me to sleep
514,even the novelty of a buddhist or hindu temple wore off very fast i enjoyed the spectacle but could tellthese priests are just more piledrivers
515,i was always so bored
516,how can the secret and hidden and precious things be about doctrine and just more talking
517,butand i don’t know why people put these things together because for me they never had anything to do with each othereven as a small boy i felt every object was inhabited by an uncanny shadow or spirit
518,i paid honor to certain toys and certain objects i found outside and hid carefully
519,no one ever taught me to do this
520,i found dead animal and buried it with ceremony
521,i always felt i could talk to animal and that they were my brothers and sisters
522,this “animism” is the natural religion of man and shows itself even to small child left alone to play
523,i remember fondly a small white dog under thickets of wisteria bushes growing on corrugated steel and i believe this dog has followed me in different forms my whole life
524,but i’m almost sure that gods exist and in any case the argument against the one god isn’t the same as against the other gods
525,in all the fulminations of sam harris and hitchens and the “new atheists” there’s nothing really newthey want to banish not just religion from public life but to enter your own mind and replace whatever vestiges of old organized religions are there with their own very stupid organized religion
526,if they have an easy time of it this is because monotheism overreached
527,it made such grand claims and when these claims were abandoned it left people with the impression that there really is nothing besides “science” which of course nobody really understands because it’s nothing but a method
528,it would have been far more honest to embrace skepticism but of course they would never let you take the logical conclusion
529,but still forget for a moment all the claims made about god about the creation of matter out of nothingwhich runs against all intuition and all observation that you can make yourselfyou don’t even need science for that
530,paglia said once that the real novelty of the one god was that he spoke the world into existence
531,how different this was from all other creation myths
532,all pagans knew the world was eternal and that its present condition was a result of cycles of birth rebirth regeneration copulation the japanese even have myths about gods shitting on fields to make them fertile
533,how proper it makes many other things about japanese culture easier to understand
534,monotheism even of the intellectual or deist variety and especially that variety makes all kinds of claims too about the lawfulness of matter or of nature about intelligent design and the like
535,it’s actually much closer to the science that claims to disprove it than to the original paganism of all mankind
536,so much of this story makes time a line and makes matter conditional on a deity or creator that lives outside it the creation of matter out of nothing the creation of your soul out of nothing
537,matter is dead in some ways homogenous and its meaning is “divine” only in the sense that it reveals the creation of the external deity or even better just the laws he made to govern it
538,it seems and feels wrong or runs against the immediate perception of the world so it requires faith a concept unknown to ancient pagans of all kinds
539,for this reason the romans considered christians and jews to be no different from atheists
540,that view is very different
541,as such there is no “scientific” reason why you would have to rule out the existence of beings stronger superior more intelligent more magnificent than us equipped with powers that appear magical to our understanding
542,the only reason i can think to dismiss this is schopenhauer’s his amusing refutation of godthat any being of intelligence higher than man’s would have already abolished itself long ago
543,but if you don’t believe that what reason can there be
544,please no say “there no proof” “i didn’t see it” scientific proof would be totally forbidden here in fact there are many strange occurrences that have been recorded by many as much as any event can be recorded but this lacks any scientific meaning it’s a case of “not applicable” if an impish deity of the lower kind with which the world is full some purple goblin with a wicked face showed itself to a pedant in a white coat the scientist would convince himself he was hallucinatingand in any case without being available for study for testing for experiments that can be seen by others this standard has been abandoned for many fields lately its existence would not fall within the power of “science” at all
545,no and what do you say to ancient accounts that such creatures showed themselves to men before and maybe still do
546,why would they show themselves to you
547,the weakness and spinelessness of modern manno god would show himself to such creatures to be jeered at
548,why
549,remember why the young men in mishima’s story of the league of the divine wind were so inflamed with passion and anger on behalf of the immortal gods
550,they knew that without them without the breed of warriors the many would forget the gods
551,they would become powerless spirits hiding among the reeds the subject of superstition ridicule
552,the true gods have a kind of power but not the kind the many imagine
553,why should they care for mankind
554,they are rare and precious and it is for man to find acknowledge and honor them
555,this at least was the ancient view and the foundation and preservation of oracles was the first question of life and also of statecraft
556,gods could not control nature or fate but could reveal its workings at key times
557,if a god showed himself today to you in a dream would you have the inner energy and power to honor him and do his bidding in the world
558,or would you neutered by the modern pervasive hivemind of the slave dismiss it and yourself as unreal or unworthy when it is the modern bugman and his blabbering that lacks reality
559,but i want you to be intoxicated with the highest enthusiasm and ready to receive these greatest blessings with great confidence
560,25 nerds so prized by the middlebrow clothmos who rule the cities and want to think that well at least they’re smart and deserve respect  are people who possess a kind of selfdestructive parody of intelligence
561,their facility with pointless concepts and abstractions make them think they have an understanding of real things when all they have is a misunderstanding of words and grammar overgeneralized to the point of meaninglessness
562,simple people confuse a facility with words for real intellect
563,it would be very easy to speculate for example on the two forms of life i mentioned above and to say as some do that there is a progress in the universe from the simple to the more complex
564,this is similar to those who believe in historical progress and that there is a motion in history to greater reasonableness or peace or prosperity or freedom whatever
565,all of this way of thinking is wrong
566,while i believe the two physiological processes i mentioned do describe two different kinds of life and their differing conditions and aims there is no evidence for any motion in time in favor of one or the other either when we consider the universe or just human history
567,if anything the evidence is motion toward the lower forms of life
568,i have no doubt anyway that beings of magnificent beauty and complexity existed before but disappeared because the conditions for their preservation were that much more difficult
569,no doubt also that human civilization came and went in many cycles over many hundreds of thousands of years
570,civilizations far more advanced than ours are buried under miles of ash and rock or under the ice of antarctica or were entirely pulverized
571,the memory of such things comes to very sensitive youths with a nervous system so strong that as a parasite it takes over the organism in moments of limpid calm a small perturbation in the will brings a faint feeling of a memory from long agothey suddenly remember like a revelation 26 reincarnation is the original belief of every society or tribe that drew its conclusions from observation of life and nature
572,the new religions the faith of israel and those that have come from it and many others that came about at that time or have arisen sincei believe zoroastrianism is likely the root also of the faith in the biblehave some divine inspiration at their beginnings but i believe at least the way they are interpreted now is a design of the human mind and calculated
573,they are abstract utilitarian and crudely political
574,before this nearly every society had a belief in reincarnation
575,this still has remained in some places although the moral meaning imposed on reincarnation by buddhism and hinduism is like plato’s for reasons of social utility and is political
576,but there is much significance in the primitive belief in reincarnation which is more like a primal and perennial belief
577,it is universal and naïve and i believe therefore it must have some truth
578,it’s not possible to dismiss it as wishfulfillment and a false desire for immortality first because as we see the later religions achieve this in a much better way with the teaching of the afterlife but most of all because to many people reincarnation is a kind of hell
579,you’ve all had very comfortable lives and maybe wouldn’t mind reliving something like this again but try to visit a burn ward
580,life is so painful for so many that suicide an escape from this infernal prison is very common at all times
581,but unfortunately for the suicides that death is not the end of the story
582,i believe reincarnation is fundamentally true even though most of these religions taught it in a metaphorical and popular form called metempsychosis
583,this is the belief that the soul the supposed but false unity of will and intellect is fully reborn
584,this is false
585,the intellect is a merely physical quality like muscular strength and can’t be “reborn” any more than your muscles are literally reborn
586,you are not at bottom your intellect this is impossible although this is the assumption of almost all modern people even when they claim otherwise
587,they pay lip service to “supremacy of the desires” or to biological determinism but they still believe they are their intellects just imprisoned by flesh and matter and genes and a biological “programming” this is wrong
588,and it’s not the intellect that is reborn i will tell you what is
589,take a fruitfly or a worker ant
590,this type of being is very close to plantlife in some ways
591,it has very primitive intellect very primitive nervous system
592,there are inborn ways of behaving of reacting to certain stimuli inborn desires and orientations “in the blood” and when you kill one ant the next one over will be identical in this regard
593,its rebirth is “instantaneous” because the ant has a will that is shared uniformly across its type in the hive and is therefore persistent and enduring
594,once the queen dies the next queen is indistinguishable from it in that thing that schopenhauer calls the will what he says is inborn way of wanting and is in a very literal sense a “reincarnation” of this same thing
595,if you don’t see this it’s because you keep confusing yourself for your intellect
596,but that part of you that is really you persists even when your intellect is asleep and would persist even if you experienced total amnesia
597,if you doubt just ask yourself someone you love if you had to choosewould you rather they forgot everything but still behaved the way you always knew they did or would you rather that they kept all their memories and knowledge but had a radical change in personality
598,this question is easy to answerif you love someone only for what they know or remember everyone knows this is a betrayal because that’s not who you are 
599,and in fact there’s no such thing as a radical change in personality
600,the lower forms of life are nearly uniform in their wills or inborn ways of acting and also very simple in the case of amoeba yeast and such they are not far removed from the behavior of the natural forces like gravity which is completely uniform and persistent
601,once dead they are immediately reborn and indeed live simultaneously in numerous bodies
602,for higher and more differentiated animals the will appears more particularly defined for each type species and finally each specimen when it comes to the human
603,but this biological reality independent of what is known remembered or consciously decided is a matter of the blood and body and this same being thing or will call it what you will will be reborn in just the same way
604,in a different time but this same particular way of desiring and behaving that is inside you will come again this is the real meaning of reincarnation
605,and with the glut of humans in our time we have to wonder if the same being also lives now in multiple bodies sometimes
606,where do these beings come from
607,some have said that these new billions of huemans that in a previous life they must have been yeast amoeba locusts and other insects that are born in multitudes in each season
608,i’d like this to be true but i think rather that in previous ages mankind also swelled to many billions or even more and also i have no doubt the entire universe is teeming with life of all kinds
609,27 it would be interesting to know what the “extinction” event or path is in each previous human cycle of civilization
610,if it is something completely random and external like asteroids or volcanoes or if it is something inherent to civilization as suchsome circumstance or behavior that leads to virulent disease or some kind of great weapon or maybe even something more uncanny
611,i wonder if the peoples and religions that exist now also existed in past cycles under different names with slightly different superficial circumstances and appearances but in all fundamental ways otherwise the same
612,and if one or a set of these or some new belief that hasn’t even appeared yet is the cause of the end of civilization in every cycle
613,a frog once suggested to me that the explosion of african populations in our time is the event that the movie alien describes a population bred under the most extreme pathogenic load and that despite its weaknesses in cold weather can nevertheless wreak so much damage on the rest of the world that societies collapse under the march of the zombi i personally doubt this
614,asia will shut them out without glancing twice or hearing of their suffering
615,i think instead the end in previous cycles has varied but that very often and most interesting one cause has been the emergence of brotherhoods of savage men who have decided to purify the earth and rid it of the infestation of the human cockroach
616,because unfortunately in the long run the development of civilization and comfort leads to the proliferation of damaged life the innovation of mankind leads to unspeakable abortions of life and men on the periphery who want to preserve the natural order begin to plot the end of everything
617,i also wonder if some ancient civilization has managed to escape all these cycles of destruction and has hidden underground somewhere
618,maybe they are really eternal and live life as an experiment detached seeing it as a playful dream they can observe at a distancemaybe an emissary surfaces from time to time so they can amuse themselves
619,i shudder to think though that by this same reasoning the aborted robot life to which the mass of mankind inevitably degenerates in each cycle of civilization also survived maybe in small communities of “moles” inside dry hills of limestone or not far underground in old networks of caves and tunnels
620,no doubt stories of vampires kobold cryptid humanoids and many others might refer to these degenerated stragglers that prey on us and terrorize usno doubt many among the ranks of deities have come from both types and stranger things still exist under the earth
621,please see deros if interested
622,there are more things
623,28 there can be no “artificial intelligence” in the way that people really mean it
624,if they mean some machine that approximates the intellect of man this may be possible and even very useful although they’re very far from their goals at the moment
625,success at chess is their one great achievement but they fail still at kicking a ball pouring ketchup recognizing simple objects could one hunt or survive being hunted
626,but they never mean just the intellect in this way or a crude approximation of it when people speak of “artificial intelligence” what they always mean is artificial life a robot of some kind or an artificial consciousness indistinguishable from human consciousness
627,there is an apparently different but in fact similar speculation that nerds love that the universe is “logic” or information
628,that what constitutes matter can in fact be recorded as “information” as relations of logic and that therefore the universe must be precisely thisthis is behind also the belief that you can “upload” your intelligence to a computer and attain immortality and many related forms of imbecility
629,the motivation for this is nerdishness and also somewhat the jewish way of thinking or the judaizing tendency that promotes facility with words and number but approaches mental deficiency and even retardation when it comes to anything visual
630,the jewish hatred of matter an ancient prejudice that precedes the bible and the hatred also for beauty that they share with other semitic peoplesand many others besidesall of this comes together to promote this kind of aggressive nerdishness
631,this is the origin of many of these claims though it shouldn’t be imagined that here or elsewhere i am referring to all jews or that this absolves nonjews
632,because the “judaizing” tendency i talk about is inherent to human nature and is very common also among nonjews and in some degree it exists within everyone together with the counteracting love of vibrant matter image and beauty
633,it just exists in different degrees in different people and peoples
634,in any case all of these delusions that you can be “uploaded” because your “brain” can be uploaded that “the universe is information” or that something like “artificial intelligence” actually can exist are all at bottom the same delusion and the same power fantasy of the nerd
635,the nerd can be described as a person of inelegant and pedantic intelligence often middling intelligence who takes excessive pride in the intellect even in the memorization of facts the design of clumsy concepts to which reality is then expected to fit like to bed of procrustes
636,and he identifies with it
637,there are very rare people in history even a few saints and martyrs who were ashamed of their evil character and will and sought salvation in contemplation sought some escape in this
638,these are sometimes noble people but this doesn’t describe the nerd
639,the nerd doesn’t hate himself his nature his tendencies or spirit nor is his intellect powerful enough to overawe his needling will and consider things without the pressure of interest or the gravity of petty desires
640,he never sees things like the true genius or the artist does when the perceiving part of the intellect becomes so powerful that it really overpowers everything elseso that the fullness of the object occupies all of consciousness and an idea or some new insight into the world is actually grasped
641,no the nerd is a creature of will under the direction of a petty will in the everyday sense and all of his thoughts concepts and designs have a forced quality because they refer always to need and desire for some kind of gain
642,this very often is just material gain but the desire for prestige is even worse
643,in men of intellect the desire for prestige is often the most disgusting especially when there’s no native manliness because this leads to cowardice and lies to others and oneself
644,for this reason nietzsche said manliness is the first requirement of the philosopher but there’s no one farther from the philosopher than the unmanly nerd and there’s no enemy more implacable of the human race and of the genius of the species than just this nerd and everything he represents
645,the attempt to “mimic” life through algorithms through the bruteforce of trialanderror will never create either life or “consciousness”just what would such a machine be “conscious” ofbut just that a mimicry or parody of the middling human intellect
646,a mirror and exaltation of the false intellect of the nerd that never leaves the stream of words syllogisms motives and desire that is always forced and contrived because it’s under pressure of some petty need
647,and it’s really grotesque
648,it’s as if you have a girl you desire she dies but using big magic you reanimate her corpse put makeup on her reteach this zombi to speak force her to copy all of her old habits condition her like you would a pigeon to act in ways you remember and that you liked
649,but in the end she’s just a reanimated liveaction doll and this is grotesque
650,this is just what “ai” is
651,it is a fantasy of power of the conspiracy of biological interests that unites the nerds the intellect of “reason”the party that believes in empty wordsthe middling and the jews of the human spirit into hoping for their golem
652,“ai” is the golem of those who hate life
653,it is their true messiah and their vengeance
654,29 youth and beauty are universally hated in almost all human societies in history
655,these societies are run by decrepit sclerotic old men
656,sometimes they use image of fat woman “earth mother” to beat the young men over the head with and make them submit
657,other times they promote ugliness in all ways ugliness and perversity in custom scarification circumcision selfmutilation
658,customs and religious authorities that concern themselves with how you should wipe your ass brush teeth how many fingers to insert in anus to achieve such and such “magicalmedical” goal petty legalisms of all kindsthe shiite sect among muslims and rabbinical judaism are most like this
659,all of this smothers genuine religious enthusiasm and the true oracular science from which can evolve arts of great beauty
660,often their food is unappetizing and looks like boiled rocks
661,their languagesmost human languages are so hard to listen to
662,tagalog is almost torture to hear though i don’t mean to single out this culture it’s hardly the worst in terms of love of ugliness actually the filipinos can be a pleasant people with an impish sense of humor inherited from the longlost negritos now absorbed in their population
663,their people are ugly millennia of arranged marriages for financial gain among the indiansoriginally a noble peopleled to a nation now of one billion that almost never wins any athletic contests that has won fewer gold medals since its inception than tiny croatia has since 1992 where both the men and the women are inbred ugly unsexy and almost deformed
664,i don’t mean to pick on them because they’re hardly the only ones and this ugliness physical ugliness is almost universal in the human race
665,beauty is the very rare and precious preserve of tribes that have striven to promote childmaking for something other than financial social and political gain
666,no the promotion of ugliness is nearly universal and the love of beauty is so rare among the great civilizations only the ancient greeks the french the japanese and somewhat the italians are true lovers of beauty and refinement and have based their existence exclusively on the promotion of beauty
667,how many times in history have cultures become ugly and petty because financial interest overrode eugenics in marriageand free love though not perfect is somewhat more eugenic than letting fathers trade daughters for personal gain
668,in their hatred and distrust of beauty one feels such societies live under a tremendous pressure of needs
669,their true ruler is the god of gravity and they are dominated by fears of the future unspeakable anxieties about money and matter and importune brutish behaviors all motivated by need by the desire to grasp by the feeling they all nourish that they’re being taken advantage of
670,they always feel they’re being disrespected
671,the desire for respect is the true mark of the foreverslighted
672,the distrust of beauty is sometimes sold as the highminded rejection of material desire by the saintly or the kind or the contemplative
673,but that’s just nonsense and you can see it in this way
674,beautyhating cultures have one other peculiarity they all share which is very revealing
675,they hate also privacy and personal space they hate also beauty in good and refined manners
676,these societies are based on such popular solidarity that it’s considered normal to barge in on other people absurd to demand to knock they make animal sounds when eatingor the way such people are often said to smell in history whenever such societies are encounteredall of this tells you what the hatred of beauty is really about
677,freud refers to the inner pain many of his clients experienced trying to shift from this kind of medieval collective smothering culture of ugliness to one where personal space and distance refinement and beauty were instead valued
678,it’s about the hatred of distinction or superiority hatred of the principle of difference and distance between individuals  that is by contrast so prized in those very few beautyloving cultures
679,and the hatred of superiority comes from the suspicion the many in such beautyhating societies feel that in not being subject to the horrible pressures of need and anxiety under which they themselves live that the beautiful and carefree make a mockery of what they take most seriously
680,the beautiful threaten to unravel the regimentation under which they must subject their constant crude need for things
681,this is why such societies descend to the lowest types of faggotry whenever their native laws are even slightly relaxed
682,islam is most like this
683,jews when devoid of their religion as well as persians who live under the tyranny of shiite law and most of all the people of the gulf states all revert to a crude animal condition without their rigid laws and become completely dissolute as the arabs were said to have been before islam
684,and they will soon return to this
685,i don’t need to add notes for spergs and pedants men like john milius are excepted from such judgments but their existence has nothing to do one way or another with my point here which is about general types and the ways these generate
686,i am speaking of two opposing views of life that are based in two very different needs of two very different biological orientations
687,there can be no compromise between those who live under the pressure of need and of material increase who are the walking shadows of the dead and on the other side those who are carefree joyous pleasureloving and worship beauty
688,one seeks the preservation and expansion of mere life the other seeks the exaltation of life
689,30 among the greeks the man of power was called aner who was different from the other word used anthropos which referred just to some shadowbeing indistinct some kind of humanoid shape
690,the real man was rare and most males were not and are not real men
691,the word in beginning was used only for demigods and superhumans like achilles or diomedes or odysseus
692,in the iliad diomedes in his moment of glory is compared to lion whose spirit has been aroused by anger at wound and scatters the shepherds and dogs before him
693,athena kindled a fire on his head and shoulders and marked him as one possessed by the true inner force inside all things
694,this burst out of him now and made itself light up above all others
695,the real man was a man filled by courage and daring that all came from an excess of being
696,this idea was shared also by other aryan cultures the roman vir the sanskrit and avestan nar the welsh ner the protoindoeuropean hner all ultimately refer to a kind of vital life force capable of superhuman strength
697,there is other word related having to do with manly youth ayu ayu refers to the youthful lifeforce that renews itself in each generation that moves from life to life without end forever persisting
698,it is behind all the indoeuropean words for youth and youthful strength and power
699,it appears in latin iuuenis in sanskrit and all the germanic and english forms
700,but most of all it is this same word this same idea that is behind the latin aetas and aeternus behind the vision of an age a cyclical age of eternity
701,how pregnant in meaning that youth and eternity are the same word and idea in these languages
702,the gothic and germanic words are the same
703,this idea very vivid in greek
704,in this the words aiei meaning forever and the word aion both contain at their root this meaning of lifespan lifeforce youthful strength
705,these peoples saw the vigor of youth as the true driving force behind life and behind all things forever renewing itself reincarnating itself anew in each generation in full force though the memories of men and of societies may disappear
706,if you want the most beautiful poetic expression of this view you must see in the iliad when homer describes the death of euphorbus
707,his death is compared to young tree in its prime blown down by strong wind
708,pythagoras looking on euphorbus’ shield in sicily broke into tears remembering that he had been this man
709,he knew of what was hidden on the other side of the shield
710,this view persists and this is why someone like dh lawrence could look on the sarcophagi of the ancient tuscans and see in this pleasureand beautyloving people a celebration of something very similar
711,they put on their funerary objects images of reveling and feasting and abundant flourishing life and great joy wine parties leaping dolphins to remind themselves that this irrepressible force nature youth continues anew in each generation and is never defeated by death
712,in same way when i poast physiques of beautiful and handsome youths i do so because in contemplating them i am filled with a deep calm and joyi see in them the persistent rejuvenation of this same eternal force that is inside all things
713,i see in this force the hidden design and intention of nature its reaching beyond itself
714,its designs are unspeakable and what it reaches and wants is mysterious to us can only be understood imperfectly and through metaphor
715,its “plan” and design is beyond human comprehension but it is without doubt that it is striving against numerous other “factions” and centrifugal forces for the production and creation of a superior creature of some kind a specimen of terrible beauty and power
716,i have no doubt that the gods if they exist would look only like perfected and improved versions of beautiful physiques of young men just like they showed themselves to the greek oracles in dreams
717,they were the first to discover the true biological and physical form of the man the correct form the true proportions
718,i have no doubt also that this force in being inside us together with others has made human history life and our own minds the battleground and stage of its action and that passivity in the face of its power is therefore absurd it calls on us to allow ourselves to be possessed by it and to wage war on its behalf against its enemies
719,if you want to understand the true power of aion of the eternal youthful energy that is the universe you must study what remains from heraclitus when he uses this word and how he connects it to the idea of fire that is the essence of all things and all action
720,and he is very right when he says “the best desire one thing above all everflowing eternal fame among mortals but the many glut themselves like cattle” this is what i believe in
721,part two parable of iron prison 31 if you recognize pathology brokenness denatured life as what it is it can teach you a lot about life in healthy state
722,there is nothing wrong with looking in life under distress if you no confuse it for life in ascent and freedom
723,when you put some kind of working dog like terrier even cute jack russell in city apartment they will start to try to dig through the floor
724,this mode is inborn to them they seek the development of their powers and there are very few sadder things than to see animal thwarted like this
725,playing at becoming itself but reduced to a doll and useless acting
726,carl schmitt said “they’ve put us out to pasture” this is the condition of life in modern world
727,32 modern world not bad just because modern and it is better than some ages in the past
728,many parts of past were as bad or worse than our situation and for the same reasons
729,the modern is “nothing new” it is the return of a very ancient subjection and brokenness under new branding promoted by new concepts and justifications
730,if you want to see our future look to europe as it existed before 1600 bc or much of the world as it was until recently and still isthe communal life of the longhouse with its young men dominated and broken by the old and sclerotic by the matriarchs the blob and yeast mode in human life overtaking and subjecting all higher aspiration
731,aztec “cities” with twenty morons sleeping and eating off the floor demagogued in the masses by blood hungry priests with dead eyes
732,it is no different if they use the doxies of reason and logos to cart us off to this life
733,33 a history of modern brokenness so many different things have been written about the evils of modernity or the crisis of our situation
734,both on left and right many maybe most feel something has gone terribly wrong
735,even those who love some aspects of the new age like technology look away from our banal time and instead hope for a futuristic flourishing that is not yet here
736,i’m a little tired of all this
737,i don’t want to just repeat more aspersions of modernity which many of you already know
738,most of these are footnotes or commentaries to nietzsche’s prologue from zarathustra where he describes the last man
739,the last man has been wrongly confused for the bourgeois though nietzsche says it’s something much worse
740,houellebecq whose explanations of the sexual problem of modernity of the incel all of these explanations are amazing and true but even he is just following nietzsche
741,if you want to understand true problem of our time you can read that then and i won’t dwell on it
742,i want only to deal with one particular case of domestication brokenness of potentially high life that has been thwarted to illustrate modern problem
743,the peculiar “history” of how the queen develops the modern effeminate homosexual is very telling
744,the problem of the modern homosexual is revealing because it is the model according to which many other kinds of higher life have been thwarted and warped into something else
745,don’t be fooled by propagandists the modern homo has nothing to do with ancient “predatory bisexuality” or with the pederastic rites found in many societies
746,on one hand such people as the modern queen have always existed but on the other there are many specimens now who become this who would not have before
747,it is very unfortunate event in life of animal
748,camille paglia says that the modern homosexual is the product of the pressures of postindustrial life
749,her model for this is that a very sensitive young boy open to aesthetic experience of all kinds maybe the kind of slightly neurotic and artistic boy that a century ago would have experienced synaesthesia such boy is turned off by the horseplay and “rough” masculinity of his brothers and father and other boys his age
750,the distancing from this masculinity is concurrent with his becoming overclose with his mother idolizing the feminine upon puberty the distance or fear from masculinity leads him to eroticize it while he turns away from women either because of too much familiarity or too much awe
751,in this she is only half right and the other half of the story i discovered from an alien mind whose teachings have been spread among some of the frogs
752,his name harro mj but i think this is false name
753,i tell some of his ideas here as best i understood
754,he tells i believe his own story or someone he knows he tells of how modern world corrupted his nature through stricture and turned him into a homo
755,but i think his story speaks to many others who didn’t turn into ghey but who have nevertheless been disfigured in some other way by the same force
756,now paglia’s restatement of freud is correct but she misses an important element of the story which is why such a boy turns away from the masculinity of his peers in the first place
757,it is not horseplay or the roughness of male competition as such that makes him turn away but the utterly fake or artificial character of such displays usually in our time
758,such boy perceives what his peers don’t the conditional and entirely dependent character of life in our age
759,it is not the masculinity the competition for status among men the physical roughness that makes him turn away but the fact that all such play is happening in already owned space
760,it is this aspect of our time that is crucial to understand
761,when i speak of something like owned space it must not remain mere word
762,when you understand something i mean you must see and feel it like you would a landscape you know from youth how to navigate all its nooks the different heights of earth the banks of streams where the trees are and how it feels inside them how long it takes walking from this or that group of beech to the abandoned factory so that the map is already in your body
763,this is only way to really understand something
764,i believe boy like this is one of the types that sees through the charade the lords of lies have dangled in front the shadowplay to dazzle the many and he is turned off maybe not by manliness but the buffoonish deluded character of modern masculinity
765,the defeated male that is turned into a peon and a neutered beast for women and hidden masters is a terrible thing to see
766,the jockeying for status the physical fights the adventures boys are supposed to have in a state of natureall of this is in nature meant as preparation for life for a life of conquest and expansion
767,roman teenagers of patrician class were sent already on missions on behalf of empire abroad
768,modern adult western male seeks permission to watch other men playing sports quaff vegetable oil relish beg for “coochie” in simulated intercourse masturbation with plastic on dick
769,precisely a character born for conquest for expansion a precocious type of boy who seeks real development and the real domination of the space around him who understands in his blood that play and manliness are to this end precisely such a boy will have his expectations about life crushed and thwarted as soon as his eyes open
770,this may be around the age of six or seven but it sometimes happens earlier
771,such boy then comes to have only contempt for those among his peers who not seeing the subjection we are in continue under their delusion and accept the breaking that the lords of shadows begin on the human spirit around this age of awakeningby nine or ten the “education” is almost already complete in our time
772,they submit to the yoke and their sham simulated masculinity is now a parody of the true manliness which in a state of ascent develops into the will to actually dominate space around oneself not into a caricature for the benefit of women
773,but this domination is not possible when space is already owned
774,this intuition of owned space comes on one very early with eyes open it’s like an evil spirit inhabits everything
775,i think there are many types of energetic and perceiving boys who reach this stage who are turned off by the moral and biological selfcastration of their conventional peers who sense the suffocating limitations of modern space
776,the rest of this story is more particular to the boy who as response becomes a homo or trap and paglia is right about that part masculinity rejected simply because of distance from other boys in general mostly as a result of a certain native oversensitivity
777,but then there is the added observation that when late in adolescence or some time in youth such boy decides he is “gay” that is but the final act of selfmisunderstanding
778,the drama of his spirit is reinterpreted on sexual terms
779,he has convinced himself that the feeling of suppression and dread that had accompanied him his whole life was because his sexual desires or “sexuality” had been repressed by “society” he forgets how these sexual desires developed in the first place that these desires themselves were a circuitous result of the truth that dawned on him in silence the truth of the utter subjection and domestication of the space in which he found himself
780,in becoming “gay” he believes he is escaping that sense of primal limitation and subjection that he felt as a small boy he has reinterpreted his entire drama as a maudlin story of sexuality suppressed or oppressed by retrograde social and political norms
781,in this he becomes an unwitting pawn himself of the very power that as a young boy he had intuited to be the enemy the great and suffocating shadow of our time that smothers all higher life out
782,the gay is the spiritual footsoldier of the new regime when he is born to be its enemy
783,this is the unusual part of this realization that some of the most sensitive and perceptive youths those maybe imbued with spark of inspiration and a conquering expanding spirit end up becoming the vanguard of that which has smothered and broken them
784,in a previous age they wouldn’t have been gay at all in the first place
785,the story of such boy is story of all higher types in our time
786,not all gays are of this originthere is jeffrey dahmer there are others
787,and of course not all higher types become gay only a tiny minority
788,but all higher types in our age are afflicted by a similar drama of the spiritwhat happens later the sexualization of this alienation particular to this case i use only as the most vivid example
789,now in all this you see this idea of space or territory that is already closed and owned
790,and this brings up the question of who or what this force is
791,i think the answer to this problem isn’t so simple but one feature of this new condition in modern age is that the masters are hidden
792,that is even why this condition of subjection seems so suffocating because they hide and so there is no opportunity for open and manly challenge
793,this problem is then to be understood through example of a different typeand i mean that of the spook
794,vivid and instructive is the matter of the gay underworld which no longer really exists in our time
795,but in the 1950’s and a little before then when the system of global tyranny was being firmly erected it should not be a surprise from everything that has been said that the gay underworld was the “negative” of the new world order its sieve and pressure valve
796,the gay underworld was part of “the remainder” the phenomenon of “homosexuality” in the modern world reaches up to the most profound of political and social problem it was always the ghost world the underworld left over that the engineers of our time couldn’t manage or account for in the erection of the leviathan
797,this underworld included far more than the gays of that time of course that’s the point
798,but the gays formed a kind of “bulk population” that allowed an easy bridge between this world and ours
799,they made it far more permeable to others as well if you had girlfriend maybe artsy girlfriend she had ghey friend you could go with them to lounge of this halfworld and there would be theremaybe two social contacts removedthere wouldone of them
800,but now that this world has disappeared you have no easy way of even knowing where to start
801,its boundaries were policed its entry points were surveilled but it always existed as a space of freedom outside the pervasiveness of domestication in postindustrial civilization
802,let’s not forget i repeat that the “gay underworld” was hardly just the gays but precisely that world penetrated by all types of deviants perverts whores pimps impresarios night club owners mafia gangsters spooks intelligence services of all kindsjust see the dark ocean society and you will understand
803,the dark ocean society of japan is the key to understanding all modern political and social organization because underneath the pervasiveness of the domestication and management of modern civilization underneath its superficial orderliness there remained the “floating world” the free world as a still and dark ocean in which moved monsters including the lords and crafters of this new civilization themselves
804,they still live in that world not in ours
805,our world is the house of subjection they live in the estate of freedom and power
806,it is only that with the relatively large number of gays that exist this world was much larger than it is now and more varied its entry points more penetrable
807,the space of night that gays created for themselves in which such types could at least feel they had new opportunity to expand and act was nuked in the 1980’s with aids first of all and then at the same time with the “gay rights” and “gay identity” movement through which they came “into the open” and became the worst and most merciless enforcers of the global slave state
808,but enough about them you must understand
809,i use this as illustrative and true example of what happens to all higher types in our time
810,the vast majority don’t become gay but the plight of the gay is the most simple and therefore instructive example of this
811,anyone born with a will to conquest and expansion any specimen born to courage and the expansion of boundaries will feel thwarted now will awaken at a young age to find themselves in a world pervaded by an evil and smothering shadow that seeks to blot out their spirit and break them
812,how one responds to thisthat is different
813,and the responses are various
814,look at litter of pups of whatever species some will be inquisitive playful seek to experiment to push boundaries to leave gaze of parents and the old to conquer space others will be far more docile and will lack curiosity
815,the only ones who survive the modern education “whole” not to speak of the regime of modern medication are precisely those in the litter who are born docile
816,and more to the point who can look at the beatendown males of today and think that a boy who inside him has the spark of conquering spirit won’t have anything but disgust for their clownish parody of masculinity
817,what matters here is which way the spirit turns and if it can survive the obstacle course of domestication that modern life and the modern education imposes on the best
818,“homosexuality” in our age in any case is unlike any behavior in the past as a total phenomenon it represents one of the characteristic ways that some of the most unusual specimens respond to domestication and are broken by it
819,modern homosexuality is a form of vacuum behavior and stereotypy
820,34 as sad as the story of many of the modern gays is the story of the modern transsexual is the same in all ways but worse
821,this explains also why so many traps are obsessed with hegel
822,they know in their blood but they misunderstand themselves and forget who broke them
823,the story of the modern transsexual is the story of our collective future
824,35 should the tyranny that has descended on our age ever gain the power it seeks and then be challenged enough to feel itself in danger the mass annihilations that will be carried out by homosexual transsexual and especially lesbian commissars will exceed in scale and cruelty anything that has yet happened in known history
825,imagine lesbian mulatta commissars with young martin sheen face and haircut manning the future bergenbelsens installations that will span tens of miles
826,36 barbarism and civilization it’s funny when westerners defer to china or the old cities of the near east and the orient as the fountains of civilization the standards of city life “we’re latecomers we were in loincloths in forest with painted face hunting boar while they had cities and writing” this true but westerner forgets what civilization means
827,less myopic than others but still myopic he thinks when he hears chinamen lived in cities for five thousand years that these must be like the cities in his own history
828,there are cities and cities
829,but what was writing
830,most of it was for inventory or the most tedious kind of national or dynastic chronicles
831,lists and lists the kinds of passages that make the young bored even with the bible
832,the oldest part of greek literature is from the iliad the catalogue of ships the heroes and their retinues are recounted with much flourish and poetry so it’s not so boring but is just barely saved by homer’s artistry
833,but nearly every national “writing” is like this and most “writing” stayed in that condition for a long time
834,chinese have always lived in houses yes if that’s all you mean by “civilization” but their history is marked by convulsions of annihilation
835,just look in their history the cultural revolution is the norm mass extinction of millions of faceless peasants in the name of remaking a new society
836,they are no hive they ignore the dead in the street and look away
837,i’ve known of ravens who have more consideration for one of their own
838,everything for oneself everything for personal utility a pleasure in cruelty toward the weak and toward animals
839,this is the endresult of thousands of years of “civilization” don’t be fooled by the supposed historical selfconception of such people
840,many periods of forgetfulness when they erased and threw away their chronicles even and totally falsified their history small example even today they teach that genghis khan was a chinese general this true for many other civilizations
841,even religious texts leaving aside the problem of translation the koran is as schopenhauer claimed a tedious book of wretched repetitive stupidity with not a single new idea in it “the poorest form of theism” unfortunately this is sufficient for the level of most people’s religious needs
842,is not clear that writing is a great advance for much of historyits value is questionable
843,only quite late some productions of genius arise that redeem the skill of writing
844,in similar way different societies mean quite different things by “city” in the orient this has always referred to a steaming pile of humanity with crowded fetid eateries closepacked throngs wading through shit and the filth of animals rabbit and hen kept in cages abused orphans endless drone of yelling humangs hawking wares and spitting phlegm on street
845,you see this still in the cities of the far east
846,even in japan that all love for its supposed order there is a terrible menace hanging on the streets of tokyo that drives too many of the good people there to the mental asylum
847,the workplace is hell and transportation system is chaotic and suffocating it reduces everyone again to the cipher he has always been in the oriental city a shadow even in his home where the woman inhabits all the terror of the ancient family deities
848,the japanese man gets allowance from wife who often physically depletes him takes his phone allowance his lunch money
849,the woman rules vietnam and the faceless clerk or merchant who claws his path in the antheap of this society is beholden to his hectoring wife like slave
850,matriarchy and anonymity are the principles of these piles of biomassnever call them hives
851,the hive is noble the hive can be a work of beauty and order but the city the city in its original form is humanity reduced to a steaming ratpile
852,in the hive the ant or bee achieves the full development of its inborn nature as worker or warrior or queen but who can say this of most cities in historydo you think man stamping papers scheming to escape wrath of longnailed office autocrat with spittoon who hawks smoked fish out of newspapers with fingerless gloves or sells birds with clipped wings to jeering hueman macacas do you think such creature is a specimen of well turned out life
853,and the more depressing possibility that for the vast majority such life is the expression the full expression of their inborn reach and wants still it must be the case that they were selectively bred by their masters to this degraded and zombified form
854,but even the scared and huddled ashandsallow faced schemer of saigon or chengdu was in his remote ancestry like the free black yi who terrorized the han as recently as a hundred years ago or the powerfulbodied selfsufficient tibetans who have made sport of them for centuries
855,existence for such life is hell trapped not only in a miserable society of anonymity but in a body bred for such a society
856,still there must be a spark they can never extinguish that at least asks for all this to stop
857,do you understand what buddhism is now
858,no look north to the manchus and other tunguspeoples hardened in the taiga and the arctic to the freedomloving mongols who to this day love nothing more than to drive out into open country with no roads and consider our cities horribly claustrophobic
859,actually in history when you look at life of true nomads who are always on the move and in open space they never engage in the kind of depressive introspection and questioning of life that you only see in settled and civilized peoples
860,the buddha became a worlddenier in the citylook at his conversion what drove him to it
861,it is the injustice but above all the filth the disgusting suffocation of city life the vision of life degraded and under distress that led him to his escape he said “the home is a place of filth” and what was this escape after all but just an attempt to reestablish the freedom and openness of the steppe where man can once again be what he was born to be
862,he thought he was opening up a steppe of the spirit and in the sangha the brotherhood of disciples and monks he was recreating that true secret society of the steppe the society natural to a man like him the brotherhood of warriors and the free youths
863,in such way you must also understand “the west” or actually the city of the west
864,the small orderly city of the north italians the german and swiss cities machiavelli praises for how wellrun they are this is entirely alien to the orient and indeed to all other civilized societies that we know of
865,the very idea of the citizen is alien to civilization as such
866,in the respect for privacy for distance for property and proprietyin the small and orderly character of the cities in the relentless concern of the aristocracy with biological quality you see an attempt to mitigate the great evils of civilization
867,actually you see an attempt to reestablish some of the character of barbaric and free life inside the city if only for the citizen class or the upper class
868,if there can be any defense of civilization it is this that historically it gave a class the full or nearly full benefits of the free life of the steppe and forest and mountain while ridding them of some of its inconveniences at the price of course of misery for the vast majority
869,in nearly all other parts of the world but the west the misery inside civilization was universal and the elite such as it was didn’t redeem this misery they themselves remained servile
870,a city means nothing but could even mean a retrogression in the human type
871,if the only civilizations that had existed were all like han china then the choice between barbarism and civilization would be easily made in favor of barbarism of free mongol life
872,37 the modern city is a monstrosity but it doesn’t yet approach the anonymous squalor of oriental civilization of default civilization
873,it’s a contradictory place but you see a counterdrive even in the attempt to preserve parks
874,this exists in tokyo in many european and europeanderived cities like buenos airesits makers must have been obsessed with preserving some piece of nature inside the city and hired the french to beautify itand in nonwestern cities that have copied this way
875,in the arrangement of public spaces as well of the streets and even of the social life the modern city is not entirely a reversion to the premodern squalor of pure civilization but an attempt to preserve or at least simulate a natural space for man to move to expand to practice and perfect some excellences as limited or stunted as these may be
876,in the modern world the return of pure civilization is the slum and the shantytown
877,it is slowly but certainly encroaching on the modern city as it still exists which is in all ways a leftover from european domination of the world and is by no means the form toward which life is progressing
878,the future of blade runner is much too optimistic and even that in elysium doesn’t approach the true wickedness of our fate if nothing is done
879,mohammed atta one of the leaders of the 911 plot was an architecture student
880,he was deeply moved by what had happened to aleppo and the corruption of muslim life that finds itself disoriented in the modern city not just in its different moral life but in the arrangement of space and buildings that upsets the life of the faithful
881,he was reacting to the modern city as such not necessarily to the slum although the expansion of modern life in the third world is very ambiguous here there’s always some slumification
882,the cities of the near east of north africa of most of the muslim world and even much of the orient were in any case always differently arranged from the west having neighborhoods closed off physically from each other walled compounds with inner courtyards and in general a turning away from public political space into the space of the family and the clan
883,this was a result not only of the corruption of authorities but of an entirely different feeling of what the city existed for in the first place
884,there is a confusion about what different peoples object to in the modern world they don’t necessarily hate in the modern the same thing you hate in it
885,i would rather ally with the leftist hipster than with china
886,the chinese will actually “appropriate” everything and pretend they invented it
887,38 aristotle says greeks are different from north europeans and the orientals
888,the asian is civilized but slavish the european barbarian is uncivilized unlearned but free
889,in this formula is assumed aristotle believed in a “balance” between these two extremes and that greeks were better because they were the “median” between these two deficient extremes
890,actually neither aristotle’s view nor the view of the greeks of his time and even later took things quite this way
891,there was no equivalence drawn between the free northern barbarian and the slavish asian but the greeks valued and respected the free barbarian far more than the asian
892,you can see this is so from many things as late as the crusades when anna comnena wrote the alexiad she refers with some horror but also much respect to the western barbarians
893,she is in awe at their handsomeness their bravery and often their intelligence and cunning
894,similar praise never exists for the civilized or slavish peoples of the near east
895,the same attitude existed also in the age of the classical greeks
896,herodotus among others expresses much admiration for the scythians and sees them as the innovators of a new and magnificent way of life the nomadic through which they confounded and defeated darius and the persians
897,very often you can read of classical greeks who perched on the shores of the black sea “went native” at least for part of the year and joined the nation of the scythians in admiration of their free life
898,the same thing happened much less often and usually not at all in the near east there were mercenaries artisans architects that worked for the persian king and others but they didn’t go native in this way the charge “to medize” referred to a political alignment taken out of necessity not to a cultural preference or affinity for a way of life
899,the athenians used scythians as police in their city but aside from a few very old families with claims to phoenician heritage there was no equivalent use of orientals and asians except as slaves
900,the beauty of northern european children is praised in antiquity very late children of angles for sale are referred to as “not angles but angels” many of the greek heroes and gods had fair hair and blue or grey eyes among which aphrodite athena apollo achilles menelaus and many others many ancient poets refer to the dorians as a blond race
901,it’s hard to believe that such idealization would have been made for the qualities of neighboring nations that were despised
902,no from all this and more it’s clear the greeks admired the power and freedom of the barbarian far more than the “civilized” way of the slave and his false intelligence
903,and the “balance” often attributed to aristotle between these two ways is no such thing but a reference to what i speak of here that western civilization the european city is unusual because it is the attempt to preserve free and barbaric life within the confines of the city
904,it’s an attempt to exalt and develop certain tendencies of that free life that could presumably benefit from the arts the science and the leisure that can only be promoted inside a city
905,it’s an exception in history
906,and by settled city and settled life i mean settled with slaves
907,and let’s not forget that the greeks never abandoned that mobile and nomadic life but transposed it to the sea as to a large extent the germanic peoples also always havethey’ve always been a seafaring people
908,entire greek cities like those of the phocaeans rather than submit to persian rule preferred to embark their ships and move to colonies as far away as france and spainmarseille was founded by them but there were outposts farther west as well
909,the athenians were ready to do the same to escape subjection and like the scythians take to the open sea in their seawagons which in fact they did for a while
910,the call of the open steppe the freedom of the new steppe of the seas this never left them
911,it’s clear from this and even more how much contempt they had for the civilized and slavish life of the asian and how much respect and longing they had for the life of the free barbarian
912,this extended in some way even to their respect for the blaq ethiopian about who herodotus says such nice things especially when he compares them to the neighboring egyptians
913,but in this case there was very little familiarity with the african his nature too foreign to the greek and there was the suspicion supported by aristotle and many others that the african and also the arab were too stupid to represent an admirable alternative
914,nevertheless in spirit i would say even now the european has much more in common with the african than with the “asian” meaning the inhabitant of the broad swathe of land stretching from han china to the near east that includes the longsettled farming serf regions of the planet
915,i know many dorks who fetishize iq above all else will disagree with this
916,the orient and asia has always been the enemyafrica is mostly irrelevant
917,the “african” may even be an ally and only became a problem under conditions of modern mass democracy when he has been manipulated and stirred up by others
918,39 some of the modern right wing is “environmentalist” and even beyond this but mostly has contempt for the left greens and other halfandhalf because they misunderstand the problem of civilization and of technology
919,the problem of modern left is they seek not to defend nature but to blame the west for the modern condition
920,and this is because the problem is said to be technological or “civilizational” progress as such
921,these people don’t understand that the rapacious life the buglife is the default condition of mankind and that the west along with a couple of others has attempted since its beginnings to try mitigate the evils of “pure civilization” and to bring the benefits of free life within civilization as far as this was possible
922,the left environmentalist is not a reliable defender of nature he’s “antiracist” first and cares for nature second
923,actually the two things are incompatible
924,china and india are by far the sources of the most serious obvious pollution which is the destruction of the world’s oceans with plastics and garbage
925,the contempt for animal life is rare in india schopenhauer says it’s for this reason that they easily rejected christianity because they heard of the gross mistreatment of animals in europe of the time but animal cruelty and abuse is exceedingly common and the rule in china and most of the rest of the noneuropean world
926,it is only indian and today european man that is moved by compassion for animals who are our brothers and sisters
927,the practice of industrial agriculture is a great evil that must be stopped but who besides european man really cares for this
928,others seem to take a great joy in the humiliation and torture of even cats and dogs
929,furthermore it is as is well known the zombi hordes of the third world that care nothing for public and national parks and that are the ones who litter and exploit them often by flinging feces as they’ve long learned being sons of the honey badger that eats its own shit
930,as is well known the sierra club and other environmentalist organizations used to oppose mass immigration in part quietly for this reason but also because population increase will on its own place unacceptable strains on nature
931,the populations of europe and japan under the strain of life in high population density in the late 20 th century chose to limit their fertility and there’s nothing wrong with this it is the governments corrupt and under the lash of financiers dependent on population increase that forbad a natural retrenchment of population
932,therefore the modern left “antiracist” pro migrant can never really be environmentalist
933,but even more in the promotion of the third world “primitive” he is no such thing and the false belief that life there is easier on the environment they promote the slum the shantytown “civilization” the locust default existence of mankind
934,it’s true that the non western man lives “closer to nature” in terms of his material needs but this doesn’t translate into a more natural life or less stress on resources he uses any excess to breed indiscriminately and make more like himself
935,any aid to africa or much of the rest of the third world doesn’t translate into improved quality of life even into improved nutrition but is immediately converted into more children who continue to live at the same level of misery
936,the true environmentalism is racism and has a racial foundation and in fact the two things environmentalism and racism are indistinguishable
937,this is why there’s endless discussion of “global climate change” because it takes attention away from concrete problems that are within our grasp to solvethe destruction of national parks of public spaces of the mistreatment of animals and most especially of the oceans
938,all of these problems are problems of race not of the modern city as such modern progress or the progress of technology
939,in fact the attempt to limit this progress and to screw back humanity or freeze it in some supposedly premodern form the attempt for example to bring back “small communities” in the modern world is the greatest danger and a possible source of the most thoroughgoing and totalitarian subjection
940,40 the true understanding of peasants you aren’t going to get from those modern windbags who extol their life or that of “noble savage” but more likely to get from chekhov’s story of that name
941,they are a wretched bunch and locusts on the earth
942,you can get a good image of them also from kurosawa movie like seven samurai
943,the peasant and serf the default state of mankind has like animal his nose directed toward the earth and the ground because it is there that the objects of interest are found the needs of bare life
944,he is far from contemplation even of the stars that homer says gladden the heart of the shepherd alone on mountain
945,the dwellers of the valleys and tillers of the soil are the prototype for all the modern “bugmen” don’t be fooled otherwise
946,this is the “frame” or worldview that turns all matter and all things into mere utilities
947,it doesn’t need technology to do so and never has
948,in primitive farming societies they will immediately execute any of the intelligent as a witch this is still done in africa and there is the famous chinese saying about how the intelligent must be killed
949,this is always the case in much socalled “primitive” life life under the thumb of the empowered old matriarchs and the conceptual dildoes they use to clobber the heads of young men
950,what is worst about the modern world is the reimposition of this life which is taking place for political and biological reasons
951,the problem of our time has never been with technology as such
952,there is no inner working of technology that inevitably leads to human subjection
953,the tendency exists merely because by allowing an overwhelming increase in the numbers of the superfluous it gives them and those who cater to them power when it is mixed with democracy
954,the left environmentalist among many others is misguided because he wants more power given to such people
955,he attacks precisely those elements of the modern west of modern technology even of modern culture that can mitigate somewhat the rule of the superfluous and their destruction of nature including human nature
956,i can imagine few fates worse than if we decided to “live closer to our means” to retrench and stop technological progress and innovation to scale back to “small integral communities” to bring back “traditional forms” in our circumstance
957,i understand the desires of those on the right who long for the great parts of the past but understand this any such attempt in the modern world i mean to promote the small village the rustic life the modest life will lead not to the reestablishment of the glories of past ages but to the freezing of modern corruption to its stabilization and permanence
958,you will get small communities run by the gynocracy to suppress true manhood and youth but this time with the benefit of whatever modern technology is already around
959,they will do so in the name of “traditional virtue” they will be christian maybe but their christianity will be a cover for marxism in one way or another
960,it doesn’t matter what ideology or religion or “ideals” you give them they will still behave the way they’re born to
961,the problem of the modern world as also of the degradation of the environment isn’t technology or a way of life or an ideology but the ubiquity and rule of a certain kind of human
962,and until this problem is solved 41 i don’t know if the wardens of this prison and owners of this space are present or not but i suspect they are
963,i don’t think we live just in some impersonal emergent mechanism a “system” that entraps everyone something like “managerialism” or “postindustrial ennui ” i think all of this was consciously crafted
964,it’s possible much of known history is falsified
965,nietzsche among many others hinted at this
966,i don’t think we can ever know who these individuals are but i suspect they walk among us like average men
967,i once knew a woman of rockefeller branchand let me say this is exactly what i don’t mean by these hidden powers i’m talking about you don’t know their names but she went to vegetable shops or on subway without anyone knowing who she was without jewelry and had only contempt for the known rich who have to walk with retinues and bodyguards and are under constant surveillance by media and others
968,what could they want then you ask if not to enjoy and show wealth
969,just that freedom and power that everyone else lacks
970,they live outside all law and constraint we are but the material and fodder for their hunger
971,their schemes are demented the movie mulholland drive revealed some of what they do indirectly and with metaphor
972,they have learned how to harness various kinds of energy for example the kind of energy bestowed by human attention in large numbers and to power certain kinds of machines with it
973,the attention that hollywood gets is received and absorbed by a machine of great power that amplifies it and serves some use
974,they founded this rite with human sacrifice and human blood and that is what this movie is about
975,they know how to harness sexual energy which is why they persecuted wilhelm reich but stole his technology
976,trump’s family knows the secrets of tesla
977,they know many other things science and rationalism are the “public religion” of our time but the rulers believe in something quite different
978,the masses are dazzled by the fridge the hairdryer the phone they live drugged and hypnotized by assurances that the wizards who produce these things are modest engineers who live by publicly known and verified procedures that they’re just quiet men who master unremarkable and docile physical forces
979,their comfort is a surety of their faith in the regularity of nature that has taken divine fear and awe away from them
980,meanwhile the world is run by men like erik jan hanussen or actually he was only a tool of others like him but you don’t know their names
981,someone wore green gloves in hong kong
982,they live in the realm of power and freedom
983,42 great lie of our age is that it is about the freedom of the senses liberation of the desires from stodgy social and moral controls
984,in fact even middle ages man lived with more lust for life even more sexual lust than the modern he worked less also
985,most of the year there were feast days
986,there was the minimum amount of work done possible to have enough crops and to pay the taxes that were relatively small
987,most modern men hardly have the property of the medieval freeholder
988,hygiene was bad and disease rampant infant mortality very high many other problems too
989,is not my favorite time
990,but once you survive childhood work is the great difficulty in life it’s the curse of adam go to small book shop in thailand you find complete chaos among the books on sale there
991,if you ask the owner why he doesn’t arrange alphabetically or some other way he will say because would be too much work and i make enough as it is
992,but in this one thing “merry old england” for example was a place of joy and drunkenness and feasts
993,they drank ale without hops but used gruit made from heather and other herbs this drink they had all day filling them with passion for lifebeer at this time was a stimulant and aphrodisiac
994,they considered the waterdrinker much like we look at the dry hipster herb who stirs caffeinefree rooibos and looks at you with dour eyes
995,it was the puritans who introduced hops precisely to make beer bitter and unpleasant and to turn it from a stimulant into a soporific that kills the sexual instinct in man
996,but before this the people of england had surely more intense sex0rz if that’s how you measure things
997,actually it’s how you should measure things because it’s a sign of something else
998,a life of great and real joy or passion is a life receptive to certain other instincts and desires that also come from nature but that the modern lords of lies are terrified of
999,it is these others that they want to suppress at least for the laity
1000,the sexual irritation that the many are kept under is different from the kind of unencumbered and carefree passionate and demonic lust you found in premodern times and that you still find in pockets of the third world
1001,this modern parody of lust drains all energy that other true lust sets the heart on fire with many other wild enthusiasms paglia is wrong they will never allow her brand of “feminism” to flourish it would defeat the purpose
1002,entire purpose of modern education is to suppress that enthusiasm to make you secondguess yourself when you hear the voice of old friendsgoading you onand yes they achieve this by promoting the tedious exhausted sexual irritation you find among the obese the “polyamorous” the weirdo old tribesmen who get off on exposing themselves to women
1003,this pervasive irritation blinds the many also to receptivity to these other desires i’m talking about
1004,“telepathy” is public and mythical version of something real
1005,this is same way that many religions teach metempsychosis because truth of reincarnation is too impersonal and too hard to grasp
1006,it’s not out of the question that we are constantly receiving motions inside the unity of things from many inanimate objects some possibly on the other side of the known universe but occasionally from people we know trees and many other objects
1007,we may have close bond on this level with individuals related to us even in the future or an intimation of those that the genius of the species intends as our mate because it wants the production of this or that child at this or that moment
1008,the most significant of these “telepathic” connections is indeed when two such people supremely suitable for each other on a biological path recognize in each other this inner intention or striving of nature for the production of somethingof course they think it’s about something very different
1009,in the normal case this is almost always man and woman for production of a certain child that nature wants to bring into emergence
1010,but on rare cases there can be other reasons for similar connection in will such as two friends who are intended to achieve some task together
1011,“we reach out with open arms in anticipation of satisfying our desire or delusion meanwhile nature achieves her secret intention” it is so in the birth of certain children but also of other things
1012,the suspicion of friendship that the “ghey rights movement” promotes has worked to destroy this
1013,women are likely to be able to receive such messages more than others because in them the intellect is more firmly planted in the body and the inborn will
1014,many times this means they are more than others slaves of utility but it also means they live more in the moment less encumbered by concepts and abstractions have more access to direct perception of things
1015,they can see through many lies and can know people’s intentions before they know what they want themselves
1016,saddam hussein was like this he was a transsexual in his soul
1017,not all women but there are cases where a certain turn in spirit frees their intellect from the confusions of their drives and the chaos of their hormones and yet they don’t lose that rootedness in nature that is usually harder for men to achieve
1018,this is why the greeks and many other ancient peoples knew that women are more likely to be oracles and to know the future and also the intentions of others they “know” the future from innate sensation of the intentions and the blood of others
1019,cassandra was such a prophetess and even the great seer tiresias was said to have turned into a woman for a while
1020,many shamans practice transvestism among various peoplesfools interpret this as “gay rights” not seeing the cultic understanding of femininity
1021,the pythia was a woman and the ancient germans always consulted women before great decisions because they could provide a different and more direct view of things
1022,the modern lords of lies have alienated women from this by promoting the hyperconscious talky neuroticobsessive persona among urban slave women
1023,that is a parody of the worst kind of men
1024,oracles in nature are already rare enough and how many have been lost to us because they were misled by the snakes who seduced her into thinking she should ape the snappy chatty self consciousness of the midget homosexual and “comedian”
1025,they know how powerless we are without knowledge of the future they keep this for themselves
1026,43 many times in a new country i got so restless in small apartment and filled with such a desire to act out that if bars and everything else is closed i go to the nearest hostel and make a nuisance of myself
1027,i was kicked out of a number of such places and also out of frathouses in the past when i told them my theories about mind control about the numbers in phone books arranged in suggestive ways about the habits of african hunting dogs and the strength of hyena’s bite and neck
1028,the people liked my stories but the staff watched me from the side with great jealousy and wanted to “call security” in mall i’ve been frequently asked by sallow guard if “sir do we have to call security” because while walking i felt myself grabbed with a fast spirit and ejaculated all kinds of words in tourette way
1029,i went to troll gay bars with hitler mustache and outraged the patrons there with stories of how the national socialists started out as a gayrights movement in a basement in munich and how this is admirable
1030,hunger for space claustrophobiathe most noble phobiaisn’t “just spiritual” nothing serious is ever just “of the spirit” of the spirit means fake and gayall real orientations exist only in the blood and show themselves not just in the higher reaches and tastes of one’s spirit but in daily life and daily needs
1031,i want always to be in center of room in front of big window when i must work which i hate doing
1032,all real thoughts come only when you walk outside standing up in fresh air i knew this long before i was made aware of it through nietzsche who says you should distrust any thoughts you’ve had indoors
1033,add to that any thoughts that come into your head in the fetid miasma of most cities
1034,add to that when the whole day you’re harassed and needled by the viciousness of others that comes from a vulgar desire for power displayed by secretaries service workers
1035,service workers have often tried to oppress me
1036,larry david understands this problem but he is still trying to be too “nice” he presents his struggle against the oppression of the service industry as selfdeprecating self criticism
1037,they are mostly vicious demons
1038,just today waitress came to try to take away coffee cup even though it had small layer on bottom my favorite cold layer of coffeei told her no i drink this i signaled with my hand and still she bend over while looking me in the eye trying to take and i could see in the look in her eye a mixture of defiance lust masochistic lust a desire to usurp a desire to eat me alive
1039,i had to repeat three times
1040,i’ve had to push customer service bitchmale against the wall he wouldn’t stop following me around and commenting on the wine
1041,i don’t pretend to be a rebirth of theseus or ajax but if any such man were born today he’d be fast in a mental asylum or dead
1042,only the small in spirit can thrive
1043,in this way they chip away at your spirit in a thousand ways
1044,traffic lights train you to obedience like animal in cage especially at night when there are no other cars around
1045,having to be in passenger seat while moron is driving i couldn’t even stand this friend and asked him if he wouldn’t mind if i jacked off while we drove between two cities
1046,“yeah man sure go ahead no big deal” he agree so i know there was nothing left in him
1047,it’s for this reason also that i go in the dirtiest of red light districts or enter porn cinemas i like to see trap injecting industrialgrade silicon in chest i like to hear whores trade stories how the word “homosexual” comes from “a sexual man” and that homos are just hypersexualized whoremales
1048,i believe this is true
1049,44 there was night club on top of strange cinema that during the day doubled as place of porn
1050,i decided to go inside once with friend and old man farther on same row contrived so that he got out right in front of us and brushed right by me grabbing my crotch
1051,i shoved his face into the wall and had to push my way past securityguard with terrible breath and goblinlike pockmarked face
1052,there was loose vampire bat in lobby that had flown in but this normal
1053,outside on the street as i ran looking for taxi there was black woman taking shit in middle of road
1054,at intersection in gray beaten up volvo there was a driver with no head and on seeing this i entered a state of vertigo and fugue
1055,some talk about this “madness behind things” the real world is very different from the one that appears to us in waking life but it’s not so different as to be entirely alien or abstract or “philosophical” in the way you might think
1056,it’s not abstract or made of perfect and eternal forms it’s not somewhere else it’s immanent here and within things and it’s twisted
1057,it doesn’t have any moral significance that can be understood by us
1058,when heraclitus speaks of all things being one and all things being fire he means this when this actually shows itself to you there is a demoniac and violent madness underlying things
1059,the real world is similar to the apparent but uncanny devilish disordered for us 
1060,its hidden order the fatal x behind things reaches for things and aims beyond our scope as humans it’s why lovecraft knew it was true our world is fashioned by a demiurge who is a blind retarded schizophrenic
1061,its origin and happenings and its fate is in the play and war of the most gruesome factions forgotten godsto them we’re like stowaway rats on a ship
1062,this shows itself most vividly in some dreams which if they had continuity we couldn’t distinguish from waking life
1063,some but not all of the insane are able to see parts of this world but they’re all unheard prophets and ever more so in our timepsychiatry a fraud has weakened all faith in them and of them in themselves
1064,everywhere the signal is jammed
1065,45 i’ve always been attracted to the dirtiest and filthiest of the gnostic sects the carpocratians and later their analogues the khlysty in russia rasputin’s evil coven
1066,they formed groups of women around a great teacher and sorcerer who could drive them into orgiastic madness the rebirth of the maenads
1067,man who plays the wrong way with this ends up being eaten alive like euripides’ pentheus otherwise an inadequate piece
1068,the jews had a parallel version the frankists
1069,all of these believed that inside us is a spark of divinity that is trapped in matter
1070,since matter and this world are the work of an evil demiurge the laws governing matter and human life as they appear especially in the bible are the laws of satan
1071,therefore to free yourself you must overturn every single one of these laws you must engage in every act of evil every crime every atrocity only in this way does the gate open out of the kingdom of shadows only this way you find paradise and get past the angels guarding its paths
1072,i don’t recommend this way
1073,some say much of the left is motivated by such a faith its secularized variety
1074,there are in the case at least of frankism some weird historical peculiarities many of the prominent leftist jews the founders of the most aggressive leftism at least are said by some orthodox jews to be of frankist origin
1075,this was so in the case of brandeis hardly the worst but supposedly there are many others
1076,i myself don’t believe this though it should be studied
1077,i feel a kinship to such sects but this not direct i must explain
1078,in general you can understand gnosticism in all its forms in this way the hebrew faith is based in claim “saw that it was good” the claim that the world is crafted by a benevolent god and that matter and the world is good
1079,there are only a few other faiths like this islam is another and schopenhauer claims greek and roman paganism are same although this is not the full truth
1080,greek optimism is of an entirely different sort than biblical optimism anyway
1081,but hinduism and buddhism see the world as something you must escape they believe in nirvana or moksa that frees you from the cycle of rebirths
1082,this is more normal and a lot more widespread in history
1083,and this is in a sense true since suffering so obviously outweighs its opposite in any individual life this is true where moments of happiness are rare and pass quickly
1084,but also if you imagine the pleasure of an animal eating versus the pain and agony of the animal being eaten you can’t be fooled you see that suffering exceeds pleasure or happiness in this world by many magnitudes
1085,many bears some african hunting dogs and others they bite out of animal before it is even dead
1086,best like i said to be killed by jaguar that dispatches you with quick bite to the skull
1087,its jaws are strong grown to bite through turtle
1088,i believe it’s the most compassionate cat but most murder in nature isn’t like this
1089,houellebecq talks about how as a boy he couldn’t stand the selfsatisfied dronelike and calm “reasonable” voice of narrators on nature shows that try to obscure the worst agonies of animals murder in blood
1090,according to any rational calculation life is not worth living because pain far outweighs pleasure
1091,heavily medicated nihilists are likely to deny thisthe blessed and happy know it’s truebut also know that reason and rationality are false
1092,gnosticism is driven by the problem of suffering or compassion for those who suffer and tries to absolve god of responsibility for this state of things
1093,sometimes it says the god of the bible was put to sleep or imprisoned himself or that he is bound with chains of adamantine and kept in a cage and that a usurper took his place
1094,other times it says that the god described in genesis isn’t the real god but a demiurge and the real god sent his emissary jesus to overturn the rule of this demiurge
1095,there are many variations and some interject not one demiurge but ninetynine all to remove responsibility from the godhead for the creation of this world of evil
1096,they should have just become buddhist or hindu and stopped trying to save the mythology of canaan
1097,maybe in its beginnings the christian faith was the same as the buddhist and this is now lost in the confusions of hateful sects that distort history
1098,it’s easy to think that this is the religion of a hopeless age that it’s a byproduct of the decay of the roman empire and the symptom of despair or suffering
1099,it’s much worse than that
1100,the problem for man as for other animal isn’t stress or suffering but the feeling that one can’t escape the despair and panic of exhaustion and entrapment
1101,beyond the borders of the known inhabited world the oikoumene there lay uncrossable oceans including the great earth ocean of the steppe and the sahara in the other direction
1102,china and india were known and trade existed but this was only a vague knowledge that could have in theory stimulated the sense of conquest and adventure
1103,there were in other words plenty of possible sources for the feeling that beyond the known world still remained the unexplored
1104,the same unknown that called the enterprise and spirit of the portuguese spanish and other europeans who set out on a colonial mission of worldconquest and discovery all of this existed in late roman times
1105,but the will or spirit was not there there was only exhaustion on all sides the same exhaustion that explains the pointless history of china india and all long settled farming places
1106,civil wars and palace coups will always continue but the spirit of man is broken by habituation to an overlong domestication and nothing genuinely great in body or spirit takes places again after a while
1107,this “habituation” includes of course those “habits of the blood” which leads to the breeding and overproduction of the superfluous
1108,once a great power imposes domestication on its neighbors and then itself comforts grow and so many are born who experience life already at birth in an exhausted state and who call upon themselves the governments and religions of the exhausted and stressed
1109,surely the external obstacles we face now are far greater outer space for us is not traversable even in theory and we know of nothing on the other side of empty spaceeverything outside the already known seems barren
1110,and yet i repeat this kind of physical limitation isn’t the real cause of a spiritual exhaustion that yearns for escape of some sort
1111,it is the very character of domestic life to present the world as an enclosed owned space and although mankind adapts itself on the whole to this condition both biologically and culturally yet there remains a glimmer of the opposite tendency inside even the lowliest
1112,he can’t help but experience this new state of things in late civilizations except with dread the dread suspicionan uncanny suspicion that the world is artificial
1113,he begins to sense that this hothouse he lives in is the malevolent creation of a demiurge that likes to observe our sufferings that he and his minions feed on them
1114,in the remote future should the evil of human innovation continue unchecked we really will live in the world the gnostics feared and that spark of vital life and energy that is the gift of nature to all youthful peoples born from its womb that spark will remain entrapped in “matter wrongly configured” matter entirely foreign to its inborn desires and workings but fashioned instead for the benefit of something else
1115,in many ways the world we inhabit now already anticipates this living hell of the gnostics and the response of those in whom the pain of civilization and modernity is most advanced the transsexuals unwittingly help to further uncouple reality from nature and to make our progressive domestication more totalitarian and aggressive
1116,and yet for yourselves who wish to fight the encroaching tyranny remember that in conditions of crisis the “carpocratian” option the attraction precisely to the criminal and deviant can be very great butone here is at the edge of the abyss
1117,and the way you interpret the call of this instinct 46 i am interested in the falsification of history and possibly of geography
1118,i think mankind is exceedingly stupid and wicked you can’t trust a word you receive
1119,i have no doubt your religions are true but can you be sure some vicious faction didn’t insert itself into the hierarchy of priests some time ago or of religious authorities or of book printers and insert all kinds of things that weren’t there to begin with
1120,for example all old slavonic copies of the bible in russia used to have heavy gnostic interpolations
1121,this explains the multitude of such sects that sprung up there including those who castrated themselves and others like the duhobors who make a mockery of the higher and noble nudity by practicing the nudity of the deformed
1122,in the west there were similar things how do you think the cathars found such currency in north italy in the rhineland
1123,it wasn’t just a new teaching but very old practices and old formulas that found a ready home among a population long prepared to receive them
1124,some were pre christian while others had spread along with the early church and preserved elements of early christianity mixed in with manicheanism and magianism and other even stranger things
1125,why do you assume then that the main religions that survived are not in fact forgeries
1126,islam could very well be such a forgery the koran is a mishmash of nonsense and possibly was originally a syriac christian devotional book that was reedited much later
1127,mohammed was their name for christ and the faith originally was a version of nestorianism that was spread by the persian king not by arabs
1128,the entire history of heraclius’ crusade against persia as of persia’s downfall in “battles” against arabs may be entirely fabricated by both sides though of course now this lie has long been forgotten
1129,what historical or archaeological evidence is there at all for the existence of a mohammed
1130,but do you have any idea how speculative the conclusions drawn from archaeology are in general
1131,just read for example the kind of “evidence” they used to establish horseriding on the great steppe before 1000 bca few maybe not even five or six bones that seemed to look like bits
1132,life is short rebirth as a man is uncertain and may happen a billion years from now to these pitiful liars to trust your only life
1133,look at thucydides who is a great man and a genius of the ages he seeks to outdo herodotus and this pattern is followed throughout all antiquity
1134,each great historian was setting out to outdo his predecessor as a rival
1135,do you think they made some things up
1136,how much do you think then that the scholar the scribe the vain “monk”the “nerd” as a type is likely to lie
1137,they will lie far more than you thinkthe nerd more than a thucydides is possessed by infinitely greater mendacity and also vanity jealousy spite and pettiness
1138,don’t you think such people who for the longest time in the form of the monk were the only keepers and copiers of texts from antiquity don’t you think they would be willing to change the text to add and even to make up entire books and authors
1139,corroborations from “third sources” would be relatively easy to manufacture as well
1140,but anyway josephus uses this rivalry among the greek writers to cast doubt on greek histories in general and in this he’s not entirely unreasonable
1141,of course where he’s wrong is in supposing that the centrallycontrolled archives of the other peoples like the egyptians the babylonians or his own are any more reliable
1142,nietzsche refers to the falsification of the history of israel that occurred at some time before josephusand i think he was referring to the maccabees
1143,there is no external record anyway of the jews existing before the kingdom of the maccabees herodotus never mentions them
1144,but there is evidence that the falsification nietzsche was referring to is even of a later date
1145,much of antiquity could have been invented by sects or orders of christians or even jews to make it look like their contrived and artificial utilitarian religions had some basis in human nature or were anticipated by wise men in the past
1146,when in fact the entirety of their energy was directed toward suppressing the natural spirit of man the innate reverence of man for the magnificence inside animals and inside things
1147,in the end nothing can be trusted that you can’t see and feel yourself
1148,47 we don’t know if all of antiquity or maybe if large portions of it was entirely made up by medieval monks or by italian humanists in the renaissanceor if some eccentric scholar at constantinople or a monk in iberia added entire books and passages to plato or to others
1149,when nietzsche says that plato “studied with the jews” in egyptwhat does he really mean
1150,could it be as some have said that the jews are actually themselves a recent invention a sect of the arabs in cordoba and that this group made up parts of plato or of aristotleor so heavily corrupted their worksperhaps working with scattered groups of monks in europe and with the vatican later
1151,what is the vatican and if it didn’t exist before say the year 1200 how could you be sure
1152,machiavelli mentions that st gregory wanted to entirely destroy and blot out all prechristian culture and that these bearded men in black robes smashed temples in their hysterical rages crushed statues burned books
1153,how do you really know how successful they were or when this actually took place
1154,how do you know that the legacy of the ancient world that machiavelli claims they preserved only out of necessitybecause they shared latin as the same languagewasn’t almost entirely corrupted by their “transcriptions”
1155,every new form of life among mankind seeks to blot out the memory of its predecessors to rewrite the history and maybe does so literally corrupting the texts themselves
1156,is there any evidence the desultory and unfortunate “doctors of the early church” ever even existed
1157,augustine is almost surely a complete fiction and there never was any such manhis pidgin “greek” is nonsense in that area to begin with and is rather the makeshift greek of the medieval monk maybe living somewhere in burgundy
1158,you don’t need to go that far though
1159,i’ve heard other less strange but still wild theories that the new testament was written by a jewish woman as a parody of greek tragedy
1160,it was an effort to overturn roman life and power “roman privilege” by means of the passion storythe dead god as an inversion of greek mystery cult surrounding dionysos
1161,does this sound familiar in our own time when monstrous historical hoaxesincluding the socalled and entirely fake “cold war” during which the united states was funding and arming the soviet union the whole time
1162,if nietzsche believed such things he would have never put them under his own name or said them openly but could it be when he says that plato is ungreek that he really means precisely this
1163,was plato or at least many of the works of plato the invention of a byzantine polymath or of a benedictine
1164,such speculations are the opposite of comforting especially in a world where the consolations and certainty of religion are rare
1165,history has somewhat taken the place that religion had i mean to provide stability to a world that is otherwise lost in complete confusion and chaos and uncertainty
1166,i want this chaos because what i want to bring thrives in it
1167,the continuity of history if not its progress is that last thread that secular scientific man unmoored in the universe on this floating rock the play of titanic and foreign forcesit’s the last connection that he had to any sanity
1168,i want a world of psychosis i want the end of his sanity
1169,what if there is no firm ground to what we receive from history and the continuity we think we have is actually a jumbled and confused messthat events from antiquity have been confused with events from the middle ages for example
1170,i found the suggestion of fomenko that the crusades and the trojan war were really the same event to be so disorienting that i had to act out in a very vehement and stern way that day later
1171,at the lounge when the bouncer asked me if “i was on drugs” and i pushed his forehead away from me in a gesture of majesty and power
1172,i was soundly beaten up by his goons in the alley
1173,the speculations of anatoly fomenko as well as the socalled “phantomtime hypothesis” which claims that three centuries have been wrongly added to our chronologythis is small stuff
1174,it’s very smallfrom these doubts i was led to many others far more horrific
1175,i’ve lived a wandering life and at times i was confused by a strange similarity between certain street corners the smell of this and that building that i supposed were different the uncanny likeness of two streets that years later i can’t tell anymore which was which or if instead i dreamt it
1176,i believe it needs to be investigated for example if mexico city is not in fact the same as bangkok and the socalled baja peninsula not the same as the malay
1177,the similarity of dishes like mole and thai curries only lends further support to this hypothesis as does the kwak’ ing language of the oaxacans and chiapansit’s the same as laotian
1178,i’ve heard rumors that as you go inland from portauprince you start to see the lights of manila and that the caribbean islands are no different from the philippines
1179,both enjoy the grilled pork the rice with cheese delights like spaghettis with ketchup and hot dogs or spam and i hear certain other things also
1180,the slums of bangkok are the same as those of mexico city and cambodia is the same as guatemala honduras is entirely fake
1181,thus it is said in some corners when columbus came upon cuba it really was cipangu or japan and he really did discover asia
1182,the entire new world and many other areas of the world also is thus a fraud of the first order
1183,shanghai can be accessed in two hours from manhattan by secret bullet train
1184,and if you ask how it is that so many travel by plane well it’s not so hard for there to be an understanding among the relatively few active pilots to keep this a secret and use circuitous routes to make flighttime seem a lot longer
1185,if you don’t want to go this far remember how they can nevertheless keep entire continents or islands a secretyou’re not allowed as far as i know to approach the north or south poles and it’s not out of the question that a tropical refugium exists in both
1186,there is an esteemed scholar from bangalore who points out that the year in the vedas has six months of daylight and six months of darkness
1187,48 but you think i’m promoting idea of “noble savage”
1188,do you understand your visions of what is “noble savage” are just a miniature overspent china a spiritual china on a smaller scale
1189,i know there no such thing as noble savage mark twain attacked the red man as a faithless liar and rogue
1190,well fine
1191,that doesn’t bother me my idea of noble and vital power is different
1192,butchoose whatever view of nobility you will it doesn’t matter you won’t find it among primitives as a rule
1193,you idolize peasants
1194,you look up to island savages living “at one with nature” i ask you to see what happened to margaret mead and how the polynesians punked hermost of the things she wrote about their views on life about their sexual freedom was nonsense they made up to make her look foolish
1195,in same way the fools like gimbutas and others who believe that mankind at some remote point lived under a benevolent matriarchy again “at one with nature” in balance with the needs of the soil and such sheer nonsense
1196,everywhere historians archaeologists find what we thought was matriarchy was really no such thing
1197,you see this in the odyssey where it is clear that the right of succession belongs to he who is husband of penelope and odysseus’ son telemachus isn’t assured of his inheritance of the kingdom
1198,local priestess of the rites of fertility of the flowering and blooming of the seasons of the earth who made crops assured to spring from the soil priestess of the local earth goddess or spirits whoever married this woman was given a certain prestige or legitimacy as king
1199,this much is true but it was men who decided who she married and they decided the sovereignty of the kingdom as well
1200,everywhere you look to find any kind of formal matriarchy you see that in reality it was nothing of the sort but something very much like this
1201,when you find polyandry as among some inhabitants of the himalayas it is men sharing a woman for lack of resources or because of some other circumstance
1202,by what mechanism could after all women rule since they are so much weaker physically and seem unable to politically organize without men
1203,butbutthere is way for them to rule
1204,and so the debunkers of matriarchy are correct but don’t see far enough into social relations among primitives and even the civilized to realize that matriarchy of a sort is a reality
1205,i already spoke before of one kind
1206,but you find among the chinese the sicilians that household is run by grandmother
1207,when many of you moderns pine for “communal living” and talk about inter generational householdsyou seem to forget that this would mean subjection to a strongwilled dragon or gorgon lady
1208,the modern girl when she pines for the community of the premodern extended family imagines that she gets from it the emotional and social support of her female cousins and a crew of servants in the grandmothers not the realitywhich is utter subjection to the motherinlaw
1209,the modern southeast asian whose ancestors have lived in oriental “cities” for generations is completely beholden to his wiferead any anthropological study written before 1970 to see the truth about asian social life
1210,in africa the men are utterly defeated and beholden to matriarchy in complicated ways the women run all food production without the help of the men who rely on them for the daily ration of bland sop mushed up from grains
1211,at times to break this monotony they seek bushmeat but they mostly live as farmers dependent on big armed woman tending messy patch of roots
1212,the entire social life in this area is managed through secret societies
1213,the apparent political power is brittle and meaningless interlocking secret societies based on the manipulation of black and white magic are the true source of all important decisions reached in the village and even in the cities
1214,women play a prominent role in such societies or outright rule them there is among them a long tradition of respect for woman as oracle which is only natural
1215,the yoruba water priestess chimping out in ecstasies over the boa receiving visions this is not so different from the pythia
1216,but where the pythia had submitted to the solar and boyish manliness of apollo such a conquest of the power from under the earth never took place in africa nor in many other places
1217,and so here as elsewhere there is a kind of matriarchy but it works covertly so that both the “left” and the “right” are fooled on this point
1218,in the end then the “left” is more correct the worship of the titanic powers of the earth of the great mother is connected to a kind of matriarchy but where they’re wrong is in imagining that this leads to any kind of freedom that it represents a kind of liberation from the strictures of modern civilization the pain of specialization the submission to moral authority the modern “alienation” and every other thing they like to blame
1219,in fact everything that you hate about modern life and that makes it into an iron prisonand i agree it is a prison represents a return of the endless sallow night of matriarchy
1220,it is a return in every way you must understand this literally
1221,nietzsche says that in the modern europe you see the reassertion of prearyan modes of life the return of socialism of the longhouse of feminism and that this is happening also to us internally where the higher instincts of the spirit are being overtaken physiologically by the retrograde and prehistoric
1222,the life of the village and of the primitive is one of utter subjection total domestication and total brokenness
1223,the “matriarchy” that does exist and that exerts enormous influence and power in the social and moral realm is only the manifestation of this brokenness of the males
1224,communal solidarity absorbs and snuffs out any personal distinction or intelligence and this task is relatively easy where it concerns the majority of the parts of the village the real problem becomes what to do with the young males
1225,in every way they represent a threat to the established customs and the physiological torpor that benefits the old and the women
1226,the social problem in primitive tribes as well as most civilized and unfree societies becomes this what to do with the young males their aggression their sexual instincts in every way they must be broken and subsumed for the benefit of the tribe
1227,this is more or less easy for the majority who lack life force in any significant quantity harder for the remainder and where impossiblethe fate of the outcast or more likely death
1228,you fool yourself if you imagine that “young males are needed for protection from external threat” in fact most societies of the settled primitive and as well as civilized are more than willing to accept the risk of submission to an alien tribe
1229,in a given area if many such tribes follow this same path of self domestication the risk is hardly even that great in one’s own lifetime and a few benighted spineless “warrior” drones are sufficient to contend against similar neighbors
1230,but even in cases where there is great external threat from vigorous tribes such societies ruled by women the old and the imbeciles are willing to rather accept subjection to the alien than to allow freedom and flourishing for their young men
1231,they are right in this calculation too subjection to an alien force rarely means extermination at its hands whereas allowing their own youths freedom and power would end their way of life for good
1232,but submission to the alien just often means some sporadic taxation that used to be relatively hard to enforce peasants are very good at hiding stores of goods and even fields
1233,the routine humiliations of subjection the loss of honor the rare but occasional rapes the loss of sovereignty means little to such people
1234,they are allowed to continue their communal life unchanged under the subjection of another and even thrive under such subjection
1235,they prefer it anyway
1236,this is the condition of the socalled “old civilizations” of mankind and especially china and india
1237,the chinese han faced the most dreadful external threats from the steppe and were frequently conquered by a few scattered men on horseback that they outnumbered many times over
1238,they didn’t care their stolid unchanging life as a community continued whether it was jurchen or mongol or black yi that preyed on them
1239,the indians once they reached their period of priestly rule and senescence also degenerated to this condition they were conquered every summer by adventurers and warlords from the hindu kush and beyond
1240,afghanistan ruled india
1241,but subjection suited them
1242,slowly with the patience that yeast enjoys because time is on its side the chinese would wait “the day will come when this conqueror too will become exhausted his blood spent then he will join us the people
1243,” and they were right
1244,this is the famous assimilation of chinese civilization the assimilation of the exhausted and spent
1245,and there’s no real way to understand the chinese other than the reduction of the human animal to mere life they are not what you understand normally when you say “civilization” but rather a perpetual subject population a uniform and undifferentiated blob of serfdom that seeks subjection and undermines through it
1246,this is the rule of matriarchy
1247,the indians and many others are the same
1248,the chinese on many occasions preferred this path to the alternative of letting their own men assert themselves and gain the sovereignty
1249,on the brief occasion in the 15 th century when they began to have a navy with its glimmers of freedom and empowerment for youths they noticed the ferment and disorder that this brought to their society and immediately quashed the whole project
1250,such societies can’t change their condition even if they want to the interests of mere life are too entrenched
1251,the way of settled life is just this then to break the youths from early age to take the boys and caponize them physically mentally and spiritually
1252,this happens in the smallest tribes as well
1253,when they become civilizations they look much like han china or the sinkhole cities of the aztecs babylonians and others
1254,you see here why people like evola jung guenon and all their followers go the wrong way
1255,there is only this whether life is stunted and broken by a “tradition” or whether it is one of the very few the rare exception that allows the ascent of life
1256,as a rule life is stunted and deformed by huemans
1257,this is why huemans are disgusting as an animal and must be overcome
1258,this is the “free and primitive life” of the noble savage this is the “matriarchy” that keeps its faith to nature in “sustainable” form
1259,in fact the society of the grass hut is hardly sustainable such places are rapacious of natural resources and often vicious to animals and vicious tyrants to people
1260,a good parody of such a society on a small scale is the movie the beach
1261,the rule of weakness is not good but something of incredible cruelty even cannibalism
1262,cannibalism is the way of all yeast life to which the human animal degenerates under these conditions of gynocracy
1263,cannibalism is the eternal way of those erased huemans who submit themselves to the venus willendorf and all “earth mammies” because this faction of nature is a putrid evil dripping blood from its claws and seeking the dissolution of all higher life spiritually and biologically to the amorphous muck of the primeval swamp
1264,if you traveled in europe around maybe 3000 bc or so you would find wiseeyed cowlike blackhaired neolithic matrons overseeing vast villages of longhouses where lived the hueman animal fifty or a hundred to a room with sheep and goats wallowing in its own shit tilling the soil eating those of its members deemed to be “chosen by the gods” anyone man or woman distinguished by vital spiritand she might even smack you on the head with a lingamdildo and question your privilege as a traveler
1265,this is the condition of most of mankind until recently and it is the suffocating miasma to which the modern world is fast returning inside and out
1266,but enough of this prison
1267,i suppose you want to know of a way out or at least to hear of a different way of life
1268,part three men of power and the ascent of youth 49 life appears at its peak not in the grass hut village ruled by nutso mammies but in the military state
1269,in archaic greece in renaissance italy and in the vast expanse of the heroic old stone age at the middle of the bronze age of high chariotry lived men of power and magnificence in great numbers
1270,we are in every way their inferiors
1271,physically spiritually and in intellect they exceed us in every way
1272,i give example our elite athletes our special forces operators are nothing compared to them
1273,we find paleolithic bones the femur so robust that nothing from our runners or powerlifters equals
1274,these men were capable of sustained speeds unimaginable today
1275,you know about marathon but not the whole story
1276,the real physical feat wasn’t just the soldier who ran the twenty miles or so back to athens to warn the people
1277,the entire army ranged on the beach in heavy bronze armor facing the enemy
1278,after the persians landed the greeks charged them from more than a mile away
1279,the persians were amazed at the line of gleaming bronze running toward them and their war cry
1280,these men ran a mile in very heavy armor and also carried sixfootplus ashen spearspike
1281,they drove the invaders into the sea
1282,and right after this great effort they marched still in armor all the way back to athens without pause to prevent the persians from making an opportune landing there
1283,i don’t think any special military units would be able to equal this feat today and these were the average citizens of athens
1284,still more they exceeded us the same way in mind and spirit their sophists were able to remember fifty names and more upon hearing them once
1285,some had the gift of remote vision that the rosicrucians pine for and that the soviet and american intelligence services have attempted to rediscover in vain
1286,here we have life at its peak
1287,you know about their great art science and literature or think you do
1288,but these were men of conquest exploration and adventure first 
1289,aeschylus had on his tombstone engraved that he fought at marathon not that he wrote his plays
1290,the free man is a warrior and only a man of war is a real man
1291,we must look to their lives and exploits for inspiration and anticipate with great enthusiasm that such life will return
1292,i’m afraid that in the end the examples of ancient men of strong hand ancient men of power will be very discouraging to many of you
1293,because you can’t easily replicate their achievements and power in our time and also many of you are actually sissies compared to them in your blood
1294,but i think it’s good for all of us to remember we’re pantywearers compared to them
1295,also while you may not be able to emulate them in every way because the age we live in is one of total repression you can still take some inspiration from their examples and try to live the same in some waytry to live according to a bronze age mindset
1296,you must not misunderstand this
1297,this is not selfhelp book and i can’t help you with how to liveno one can
1298,i am concerned with the subjection of life and the suffocation of vitality
1299,i hope to show you that things don’t need to be this way and that you don’t need to limit yourself to small things
1300,above all you must reach for the great aim physical and military independence
1301,only the warrior is a free man
1302,the only right government is military government and every other form is both hypocritical and destructive of true freedom
1303,you must aim high
1304,band with your friends on the way of power and know that nothing has the right to stop you and nothing can stop you
1305,i say this especially to the military men and those who will become
1306,some time ago i spoke with another frog about generalissimo alfredo stroessner
1307,he was dictator of paraguay for forty years
1308,he went to sleep at one in the morning and got up at 4 am aside from this he took a two hour siesta in the afternoon this is before air conditioning and siesta is a necessity in tropical places
1309,the entire day he worked relentlessly for his country and to keep down the vicious and satanic communist sect that would have massacred his peoplebut he also did this for his own glory
1310,the frog says to me yes this drive is admirable but you have to be specific you can’t encourage people to strive like this to succeed at world of warcraft or at their career as an interior designer there’s no honor in that
1311,i agree
1312,but when you look at those ages in which life is ascending the great vitality of their blood is the same as the great aim for which they reach
1313,and although we live in the most debased of all ages it’s still possible as you will see to break this babylon and have the eternal fire of youth surge you to the heights of power
1314,in your own life you can break their power and ascend to a chaos of joy and destruction
1315,and in our future i already see like faint image far on horizon of vast ocean in violet eveningi see the islands of hyperborea on the edge of this leviathan where we will be able to establish new outposts and subdue this great beast from the outside
1316,50 imagine a mitt romney but differenta romney who actually was capable of acting like he looks and was worthy of his looks
1317,imagine a younger romney who rouses the nation to a new war against india through power of charisma and speech alone
1318,then he leave on ship to head the armies conquering india
1319,but then come rumors that mitt ran a black mass satanist dinner in new york
1320,also people awaken one day and find that someone defaced the holocaust museum and the lincoln memorial rumors spread that it is mitt and his friends in preparation to overthrow the government
1321,so he is recalled from his command to stand trial
1322,instead of returning mitt runs to russia where he becomes a major advisor to putin
1323,soon though he finally has to leave in a great hurry when it is discovered he’s been banging putin’s wife in secret
1324,he runs to china where again he miraculously becomes a major political force and advisor adopting chinese customs and language with ease
1325,after some time he leaves china and ends up living in afghanistan with the tribesmen as one of them in one of their mud fortresses where he is finally found by american special forces and he goes out fighting charging them repeatedly with machine gun in his glorious blackandgold armor and dunelike headset
1326,exactly such and more was the life of the ancient alcibiades from athens
1327,how inconceivable
1328,even as versatile and flashy a man as trump is very far from this possibility in our time though he at least makes such a type somehow believable
1329,there’s nothing like it in almost any other era of history
1330,someone like talleyrand is famous for switching from the monarchy to the republic to napoleon and back being somewhat successful under different forms of government and that’s rare enough to make him famous
1331,but that was all within one country
1332,alcibiades’ achievement is made all the more amazing by the fact that different cultures at that time were actually different their ways of life entirely alien to one another and yet he excelled everywhere
1333,i believe this is because in athens where he grew up he picked the god of erotic passion as his patron
1334,he was very beautiful youth admired and pursued by all the men and women
1335,he rejected the advances of the pelasgian pedopervert socrates a story that plato then inverted and twisted like the lying cunt and phoenicianasskisser that he was
1336,alcibiades excelled in athletics and at skrewl he refused to play the flute because it made your cheeks look puffed up and ridiculous
1337,other boys followed him considering that the harp is noble but playing the flute in music is something for slaves and cocksuckers
1338,as he grew in power his shield had eros with a thunderbolt on it and this scandalized the older men
1339,in such way he showed that he was a disciple of the irrepressible life force a devotee of the young god of sexual passion and total destruction he showed that no law or word of man would stand in his way
1340,in the beginning was the word
1341,no
1342,in the beginning was the demonic fire that bursts out in men like alcibiades and lays low the cities of men and exposes all their nonsense
1343,such men are sent by nature to chastise us and be our nemesis
1344,they are the great cleansing
1345,his story is told by thucydides and plutarch though you must know the latter is a famous liar
1346,but i think there must be someone as colorful as alcibiades among you
1347,51 the mystery of rigor mortis is very revealing
1348,why is dead flesh rigid
1349,but study was made where they put dead rigid flesh into bath of atp the master of energy for cells and the muscles softened and relaxed
1350,the physiologically energetic state is the relaxed state
1351,flesh that is either rigid or loose is spent but energetic biomatter vibrates in a ready repose you see in the glowing skin of very healthy young people this relaxed suppleness in flesh like pietro boselli
1352,i’ve written letter to him to ask him to allow dozens of nubile women to touch his soft glowing full and rubberylike vibrating skin all in public
1353,the modern world exhausts and in doing so it makes everything rigid or turns it into a diffuse blob
1354,physiologically it promotes the stressors estrogen serotonin hyperventilation overexcitation the hallmarks of energetic exhaustion
1355,loss of structure form and differentiation follows which was the intention
1356,there follows on this also a spiritual and intellectual rigidity the orientation of the ideologue of the social activist but also of all our intellectual class right and left as of those who work in the corporate world and in most of the military
1357,they’re stiff and constrained because in short they live in utter fear fear that they will lose something
1358,they have very little to lose but they live in this fear anyway and this is why when there is a question of potential gain or worse for them potential loss they react with desperation they freeze in terror and hyperventilate
1359,our politicians are all like this and quiver in fear of the spanking hand
1360,everyone was already so tired of their robotic platitudes that they repeat out of timidity and because they’re all owned which is why a man like trump who seems not to care and to find joy in this flouting and energy in this outrageous looseninghe seduces
1361,the modern world is a killjoy in short
1362,but the ancient greeks were quite different and different also from the overserious stuffy men with english accents who play them in period dramas
1363,what they admired was a carelessness and freedom from constraint that would shock us and that upsets especially the dour leftist and the conservative roleplayer
1364,there was a hippocleides from athens said to be one of the most beautiful youths herodotus tells this famous story of a man admired by all the world of the time
1365,he went with dozens of other youths from various greek cities to try to marry the daughter of a very important and rich autocrat in sicily
1366,this man decided to test out the suitors to find which would be the best husband for his daughter he put them up for a time treating them with lavish parties while he tested them in feats of athletics wit conversation and other abilities
1367,it’s a sign of this people’s greatness that marriages weren’t conceived purely as political or financial alliances but that their aristocracy paid attention to biological quality in pairings
1368,very few nations have the freedom from the fear i speak of only a few peoples have had the sense to raise their snouts from the ground look to the stars and consider something other than the utility of immediate advantage in marriage and children
1369,the way our own elite today marries and pairs off by the way is anything but “eugenic” two overthehill spent people in their thirties marrying for “practical” reasonsthis doesn’t give rise to strong children
1370,the bodies of middleaged people nauseate me and i assure you they bring nausea to nature as well
1371,in any case hippocleides was becoming the favorite of the father for all his great qualities his illustrious lineage his looks and his charm in conversation
1372,at the last party however hippocleides got drunk and decided to start dancing on the table
1373,then he started to dance upside down on his arms moving his legs around
1374,well you know that men then didn’t wear the ridiculous constraining clothmo clothes we wear today such as pants so the father was offended at the show
1375,he said “hippocleides you have just danced yourself out of a marriage” but the answer was “hippocleides doesn’t care” in this one phrase you have the whole attitude of this beautiful reckless piratical aristocracy that colonized and conquered their known world
1376,it’s an attitude that upsets all the moralfags of our time of the left and right
1377,hippocleides went there to have a good time to display and use his powers and excellences and biological superioritybut these two things are the same
1378,he didn’t care about the gain or loss of a wife
1379,he didn’t go to act like a meek beaten male ready to dance to some sclerotic’s tune
1380,he was as careless of his own property as of others’this is what tacitus says also about the most noble men among the germanic tribes who lived only for the joy of war and battle
1381,this is what the great among the greeks admired
1382,another story shows you the same thing it is also the attitude of diogenes the cynic
1383,when alexander the great came before his bathtub and asked him what he would want most of all in the world diogenes told him to get out of the way stop blocking the sunhe was just trying to catch some rays
1384,now compare that to one of our slavish intellectuals and philosophers and how their meager spirits would huff and puff at the approach of even a midlevel constipated bureaucrathow distinguished
1385,the honor
1386,alexander said that if he had not been alexander he would wish to have been diogenes
1387,i don’t know if i can recommend for you to be like diogenes or hippocleides
1388,it’s hard maybe you have to be born that way
1389,i can tell you it’s a better thing to aspire to divine carelessness that comes from embracing the life force and that this is what this great people loved
1390,anything truly great must have some of this divine carelessness
1391,didn’t the christians also believe in “give us but our daily bread”implying that this is enough and you shouldn’t worry about anything else even for the week
1392,nietzsche say good things about poverty independence and being of good cheer
1393,and these were very poor men but the sons of god need nothing more
1394,52 schopenhauer explains the carelessness and joyful frivolity of women by the fact that they live in and for the genius of the species
1395,although unconscious of it they are full of its boundless aims that reach far beyond the individual with his petty anxieties and cares the coming of the next generation is the most serious matter
1396,they live in the species
1397,in them the species rejuvenates itself
1398,it goes without saying i’m talking of women in the best case and most specimens are botched
1399,why are they botched though
1400,they’ve been taught to hate their own natures and instincts and in some cases these instincts have been warped or butthexxed into something else they’ve been as a wit recently put it bernankefied up the ass
1401,modern women have given up this great advantage so they can become neurotic copies of gay deskworkers
1402,they’ve abandoned the great power endowed in their blood
1403,if you don’t believe me remember a carrier pigeon that knows the waysurely he would lose his way if he saw a map and had to think about it
1404,what comes from the blood is best
1405,but it’s hard to hear this call of instinct today because you’re taught to distrust it
1406,abandoning yourself to instinct once one has a discipline and practice through the body a man can pass over a chasm on a tightrope with a sure step the left talks much about letting loose about no longer being repressed
1407,if they only understood what this really meant
1408,i will show you men who really didn’t have any hangups who weren’t repressed at all
1409,one name was clearchus and he was a spartan general
1410,he was sent by sparta to city of byzantium by mouth of black sea
1411,they had asked for help
1412,he came there as military advisor but soon no longer answered to sparta he used his power and contrived to invite the prominent men the senators and the rich of the city to a meeting where they were then hung by the neck
1413,he took their property and took the prize of sovereignty in this place
1414,after sparta sent an army to dislodge him he put up a great resistance in difficult battle but was defeated
1415,then clearchus managed to escape while the city was besieged by night he sneaked away in a ship with the treasure from a neighboring city that he had also taken over
1416,eventually he fled to persia
1417,but in persia he didn’t just enjoy his riches which he had won by the power of his hand
1418,this man was possessed by the passion for war and adventure
1419,he put out a call for many mercenaries from all over the greek world and led this army through many bold enterprises in the wilds of thrace and the middle of the persian empire where however he died because of treacheryhere he was carelessyou must be careful and know how to use the fox as well as the lion in you
1420,i tell you of another man praised by machiavelli as a guide for life a kind of life coach
1421,he talks about a man agathocles from the ancient city syracuse a greek city in sicily
1422,this man rose from humble beginnings through the ranks of the army because of his great bravery in battle and his astute mind planning stratagems and ambush
1423,eventually he was appointed top general in the city where again totally uninhibited and unencumbered he invited the full senate and all the notables to a meeting where his soldiers killed them all
1424,he took the prize of power in this city
1425,then with many struggles he defeated the carthaginians who were harassing the greeks in sicily by landing in africa and giving them bloody nose
1426,he ruled securely and in great glory
1427,i tell you these stories because they show the lives of two men who were similar who knew how to really let loose who weren’t held back by petty inhibitions
1428,these are men who really knew how to enjoy their freedom and who weren’t limited by the opinions of others
1429,what was slogan of last decade in america
1430,yes you can
1431,this is slogan of last decade in america at least and i see no reason why you shouldn’t take this idea to its conclusionsafter all no one of the very moral wise men who rule that country saw anything wrong with that slogan
1432,surely they must want you to have “internalized” it
1433,please remember that these small people like bill gates zuckerface and bezos are entirely dependent men
1434,they can’t really do with their wealth what you think they canfor example they could never just kill a man and take his wife but even the ruler of the smallest african country has this power this true wealth
1435,when your happiness and wealth depends on the force of arms of another you’re not really your own mannor can you enjoy the greatest delights in life
1436,clearchus and agathocles knew this they show you one of the ways out they’re really authentic men who went their own way
1437,yes you can
1438,53 the pirate and the fortress “work was never pleasure for me nor homekeeping thrift which feeds good children
1439,but to me oared ships were pleasure and war and wellglinted spears and arrow” so speaks odysseus playing the pirate
1440,this is motto and life of the pirate
1441,do you understand what pirate is
1442,many times i’m asked why the bronze age
1443,because it’s the heroic age you see in iliad and odyssey yes but don’t forget what hero really means
1444,thucydides says the men of that time enjoyed piracy and saw nothing wrong with it and this is true
1445,and what is the pirate but the original form of the free man and of all ascending life
1446,how pathetic when you are told now about “living life” or “having a life”these people know nothing about what true life means
1447,compare the intensity of alcibiades that superpirate or of what i am about to describe here to the “life” you’re encouraged to “have” today
1448,how worthless the vaunting of these anxious creatures who live on pharmaceuticals cheap wine the rancid fartfumes of status and approval they beg from each other
1449,schopenhauer says that at some point in the past all animals were herbivores but then some species decided to take its own life in its jaws to risk itself and with great daring become a beast of prey living off the hunt
1450,the predator is always the more intelligent animal
1451,in every decision to become a hunter or pirate a man or a people is showing great daring and embarking on great freedom
1452,hero is not slave to the many who sacrifices himself for them the common man is awed by this kind of “sacrifice” because they would never do this for themselves or others
1453,but this is hero reduced to faithful dog
1454,wolf seeks not to “sacrifice” anything but to discharge its powers over territory
1455,we take the wolves and lions and leopards from among us when pups and break them with false ideas vicious conditioning and lately drugs that would have lobotomized a da vinci an alexander a frederick the great out of existence in his youth
1456,then the energy that remains to them is channeled into mindless work for money
1457,labor and commerce are the ways to subject you to mere life and its preservation when the superior are corrupted to a life of work and finance they slowly move for their own destruction in the long run
1458,i could say leisure is the source of all great things
1459,the preservation of life is tedious freedom from its demands is needed for all high science art and literature as well and also all beautiful living all adventures all development of your body to the heights of beauty
1460,one of the reasons the modern world has no great culture is because the sons of the rich have such bad conscience about not working they all strive the same as others to climb on top of each other in normie jobs
1461,just fifty years ago most used to list “sportsman” as their main profession that was in a recent time with slightly more beauty and more art
1462,butbutit is wrong to look at this aspect of life because it assumes we have more familiarity with it than we do
1463,it’s not just that we don’t “deserve” to have a higher culture although it’s that as well but that the purpose of such a thing is completely alien to us
1464,from the point of view of real culture and refinement we’re as barbaric as the most obscure herd of the khwarezm where the women scratch their pubes in public we’re just more tame and insipid than they were
1465,so when i mention leisure don’t imagine i mean by it what you mean by it
1466,it’s not just leisure you don’t need just leisure for higher life but specifically leisure for preparation for war 
1467,to escape the subjection of our time you can’t really look to science or art any longer you have forgotten their purpose
1468,they’ve been defanged and almost all participation in these today amounts to a kind of cargocultism
1469,who can even think of a true scientist or artist among us
1470,i think there is maybe a century since one existed
1471,just see how cellini crafted his perseus in what frame of mind he was and how foreign this is from our “artist” diddlers
1472,paglia says the artist is an obsessive with a mind close to that of a stalker or serial killer and she is right look at monomania of newton or character of people like balzac or baudelaire
1473,violent spergs and obsessives
1474,our diddlers are diddlers because they lack all intensity and all faith in themselves and what they do
1475,they’re not even nihilists they lack all conviction in nihilism too they just lack intensity they’re pissed dry
1476,this is why in this book i don’t promote for you the life of the scientist or artist or writer because in our age these degenerate to hobbies and ways to pass the time and there’s no value in this
1477,people who promote these things without really having a reason to are just doing this to make you harmless and to advertise to others in media or elsewhere that they too are harmless
1478,what past ages understood by leisure is very different from what we understand
1479,should robots relieve mankind of labor there won’t be any flowering of the intellect or the arts or sciences
1480,it’s not enough not be free from work because the retired and the neet’s are like this as well as most academics and many others but all do nothing that’s worthwhile
1481,they’ve been reduced to a constrained and dependent state and this is the problem
1482,constrained and dependent people don’t have real thoughts for same reason that nations without manufacturing don’t really understand anymore what “innovation” and invention was for in the first place
1483,so our science and technology too is just more diddling
1484,cervantes completed don quixote while in jail spinoza was a lensgrinder diogenes was homeless and many other great things were done by people who were poorer or in direr straits materially than people today
1485,and yet one can’t deny that the life of the average american is that of an overworked overstressed slave but the rest that would come from relieving him of that would be just that simple rest if it doesn’t also come with manliness and sovereignty
1486,there is no substitute for freedom and powernot even the feeling of freedom of power is a substitute for the real thing
1487,the pirate the true warriornot the modern soldier in subjection to a high brass eunuchis the only free man and it is this freedom the primal freedom of the bronze age that some must recapture before anything else can be done
1488,listen to what tacitus says of the ancient germans they preferred to win through battle the things of life and considered it mean and petty to work the land and sweat and toil rather than to get their living by their spears and by risking their blood
1489,they otherwise spent much of their time in feasts and idleness
1490,the noblest youths among them if their tribe was at peace would go to other tribes to seek out wars because lack of adventure was odious to their race and only through risking blood did they win distinction
1491,this was also attitude of the medieval knight the chevalier the rittern the riders who considered the life of the serf of the community to be mean and dirty worthy of slaves and low castes and women they were always ready to ride away to new things and new adventures of glory and danger
1492,so you see it’s not enough to say “such people were freed from caring for the necessities of life they had leisure” it was leisure of a very specific type
1493,the roman aristocracy as nietzsche says had the motto otium et bellum leisure and war these being the only right ways of life for a man of power and freedom
1494,in celine’s journey to the end of the night i think he says at one point that his landlady otherwise a modest woman had an aristocratic contempt for labor this was but an idle vestige and he makes fun of it
1495,by his time the last flower of the aryan aristocracy had been extinguished as nietzsche says in french revolution a mass revolt of racial slaves that remade europe and took it on the downward path
1496,then there was another peripheral aboriginal revolt in 1917 that plunged europe into a civil war from which it still hasn’t recovered
1497,but in celine’s book the main character in his restless seeking in this trash worldhe was looking for that hidden key the true freedom into the expanse of open space that he could conquer
1498,where to find the frontier
1499,there are many places but path is not easy
1500,in the nations leisure from the slave state must be secured and this leisure must immediately be used in preparation for war
1501,in greek city the man of power spent his time in the hunt at the gymnasium in the study of military history and strategy in every way making himself ready for war
1502,many think of the greek age when they think of its spirit they think of a kind of solidarity and soldierly order quite different from what i talk about herethey think of the line of hoplites and their discipline
1503,they think of this age as one where the individual subsumed himself to the city and its laws to the discipline of the ranks and they connect this seeming egalitarianism to the practice of democracy in our time
1504,in this way they want to flatter themselves
1505,modern man is then called on to make a similar “sacrifice” and blamed for his selfishness
1506,this is confused
1507,in beginning the hoplite the man who fought with heavy round shield tall spike and heavy armor he did not come as a “tool” of the republic or a democracy the way modern soldiers are tools of the slave state
1508,if you want to see what the spirit of the bronze age is you look to ancient drinking song at the mess halls of crete and sparta “this is my wealth my spear and my shield
1509,with this i trample sweet wine from the vine
1510,with this i am called master of serfs
1511,those who do not dare to have spear and sword and fine leather shield to protect skin all cower at my knee and submit calling me master and great king” this was real song a popular drinking song among the ruling men
1512,such formed small companies of adventurers who early on took over the state away from the mounted aristocracythemselves equally piratical predators
1513,some time after they took over a state and established themselves as its rulers they then “submitted” themselves to the rigors and discipline of a strict training program
1514,but only in the sense that an athlete enters training in a team specifically for making himself strong and ready for a task and never losing sight of that specific task
1515,when we see the greek cities at their heights in the classical era for which we know this culture ruled either by aristocracies or in some cases democracies we see cities where such men have taken over and built a state for themselves and for the purposes of training for battle and supremacy in battle 
1516,that same haughtiness and lust for physical power that you see in the song that never left them
1517,in the case of democracy the only difference is that the sailors are added also to the ruling assembly of armed men
1518,and you can understand then the meaning of this ancient “publicspiritedness” which isn’t that at all but free men accepting the rigors of training together so they can preserve their freedom by force against equally haughty and hostile outsiders and against racial subordinates at home
1519,any “racial” unity of the greeks was therefore only the organic unity of culture or language but never became political such people would never tolerate losing the sovereignty in the states they and their recent ancestors had established to protect their freedom and space to move
1520,but to draw any parallels to our time is absurd these men would have never submitted to abstractions like “human rights” or “equality” or “the people” as some kind of amorphous entity encompassing the inhabitants of the territory or city in general
1521,they would have rightly seen this as pure slavery which is our condition today no real man would ever accept the legitimacy of such an entity which for all practical purposes means you must for entirely imaginary reasons defer to the opinion of slaves aliens fat childless women and others who have no share in the actual physical power
1522,how is it possible for all to have an equal share in the state and a full demand on its resources when they in fact possess no actual physical force and if you think this question through you will understand also the nature of our subjection in this time
1523,because it is not these people who are at fault but a hidden power that uses them as a pretext
1524,modern “democracy” is totalitarian and vicious and tries to subject the best to the rule of the heaps of biological refuse and most especially to the rule of those who can stir them up
1525,the military men who constitute its external defense and its internal police forces should in principle never accept this condition
1526,that they do is a great question mark how is it possible
1527,to what end and how did they agree to this
1528,what’s in it for them
1529,the ancient life that i describe here the bronze age mindset is one of complete freedom and power
1530,there is a hidden path for you also that remainsbehind the marketplace it begins in the thickets of small woodsit winds up many steep paths toward the high mountain air to life in the ascent uncorrupted by the miasma of the yeast man and the toilets in the river valleysthe life on jason’s argo can be reclaimedand by some few in the modern world it has been
1531,54 greek friendship you think maybe i promote the ruthlessness of a machine politician with tunastained brown sportcoat or a petty office intriguer or catty interior designer with upward lilting voice who backstabs his colleagues to get contract
1532,fools you think i’m here to promote a “way of life” or morality
1533,no principles or ideas are of any use today all will be retooled and taken over by people like these
1534,selfhelp is completely useless and not what this book is about rather i would like most to go toward selfdestruction and to be rid of them
1535,i only care about very few who being constrained in their predatory nature by this openair zoo must look to the past to understand what is possible
1536,i want to give encouragement to some who are a certain way in their blood and to encourage them to become the purifying hand of nature
1537,among your instincts you will find the longing for strong friendships that the modern evil tries to snuff out
1538,and they have good reason to try this because every great thing in the past was done through strong friendships between two men or brotherhoods of men and this includes all great political things all acts of political freedom and power
1539,the modern zoo wants you instead to be a weak and isolated “individual” in most greek cities there were the aristocratic clubs or fraternities which were always places of great plans great ideas and spiritual ferment
1540,here were made great political plans plans of colonization and exploration of new lands and new cities plans of conquest actions against the designs of tyrants and plebs
1541,where is your bulwark today against babylon when all this has been made illegal for you
1542,in life of cellini you see how different is a real free man when insulted or when one of his friends or family is hurt he gathers fifty bravos for a raid on the enemy something impossible in our states today not only because of the immense power of the evil that suffocates but also because you have no such friends who could or would help you
1543,a brotherhood of men in this form is the foundation of all higher life in general there is a certain madness an enthusiasm that exists also in a community of true scientists or artists that follows this same pattern
1544,it is totally forbidden in our time it’s totally absent in universities which is where science has been sequestered
1545,but what fate can science have here
1546,everything in corporate labs in universities as in government labs and at the military and intelligence facilities that still carry out some scientific taskseverything militates to crush the spirit of science
1547,the dedication severity focus and enthusiasm necessary to sustain true scientific enterprise are forbidden because they make women and weaklings uncomfortable the presence of “lactation rooms” and an environment where such rooms could even be builtthe suppression of vigorous debate the promotion of an “unhostile environment” of petty chitchat and chumminess the subjection of scientists to administrators human resources cunts with fibromyalgia to the crushing banality of everydayness all of this reduces the young scientist to domestic muck again and destroys his aspirations and will
1548,the assault is very heavy in silicon valley and other holdouts of research as well where however there wasn’t any serious innovation being done in the first place already technology had been reduced to the development of dick pic apps for adolescents
1549,science has long ago ceased and been castrated will it be born again
1550,the cleansing barbarism that i talk about here must first sweep the world no science is possible any longer nor anything else in a place where all spheres of life have been submerged into the great mother of the yeast
1551,but this isn’t really about science or art i say again you’re very far from understanding what those are even supposed to do in the first place
1552,do you know how for greek all higher aspirations went into strong friendship between two men who together dedicated themselves to a higher task
1553,in thebes epaminondas and pelopidas reformed the state and established a democracy based on the pythagorean sectthat last part not important
1554,they believed in some peculiar things like reincarnation the veneration of the “left side” and also of beans and other legumes which i don’t understand so well
1555,but it was they who established the famous “sacred band” the elite military unit that broke the power of sparta
1556,this group was formed of close friends and you will always have too much love and compassion for a real friend to waiver in courage in front of himbut i doubt you understand what such friendship means or that you ever had such friend
1557,in athens the two friends harmodius and aristogeiton put down the tyranny through their schemes and their bravery this is you know why all tyrants and totalitarians are suspicious of strong friendships between men
1558,most of all this is feared by the middleaged lesbos and defectives that are used as guards by our prisonstates
1559,and yes i know the rumors that these friendships were sexual but i believe this is misunderstanding and exaggeration promoted by the homonerds of our time for reasons i will explain later
1560,the model for all such friendships was that between achilles and patroclus homer never hints such friendship was sexual
1561,it is only out of the poverty of our imagination that we think it was because we can’t conceive of such intense love between friends without some carnal or material benefit in play
1562,it was out of his friendship for patroclus that achilles embarked on his great rampage it was for the sake of his friend that he would not tolerate living a long and inglorious life at homehe chose instead a short and glorious one and a violent death full of promise and beauty
1563,friends can spur you to this
1564,how shameful to drag out life like a dog and die overseen by strangers in a hospital who hate you rather than to die in the prime of your youth for the sake of your friend and to leave behind a beautiful corpse
1565,the original form for all this was the divine pair of charioteers castor and pollux or for the aryans it was the ashvin twins and for the saxons it was horst and hengist the pair of the chariot driver and the archerdo you understand this is the real root of all the higher aspirations of europe
1566,the charioteers who took over europe around 1500 bc depended on this close bond between two men for its military organization and probably this people itself had its ultimate origins in friendships of this kind
1567,the spartan state in any case entirely depended in its education of youth on this pairing of two friends as knight and squire
1568,it was this conquering aristocracy that really made europe stand out from the morass that the rest of the world has always been stuck in and for the greeks and all great men of the bronze age and not just the greeks friendship wasn’t just a way to “temper” the lust for power and adventure that some of you will surely embrace but an absolute prerequisite for it
1569,it is most of all not a duty
1570,friendship is a social relation of a kind that is beyond all “ethics” you see and if you ever think of it in terms of ethics you misunderstand it
1571,it is a great pleasure between two very different from sexual pleasure between man and woman but of the same species in that it is pleasant and never feels like “ethics” which is for cows
1572,there have been a few attempts in our age to replenish this form of friendship for example montaigne’s famous essay
1573,there have been other attempts as well you find some nice words on friendship in nietzsche in zarathustra  and then most of all there are the modern scouting movements that come from germany and from this same spirit
1574,the first movement like this was called the wandervogel but there were various others all based on the experience of nature the promotion of camaraderie and of nationalism
1575,this included the jewish youth guard movements that became zionists the boy scouts and others in america of course
1576,among the jews the promotion of this kind of camaraderie and friendship was a great miracle in the early 20 th century because it so much went against their culture of the cramped shtetl  of nerds dominated by women and old people and by fear
1577,it was a great act of selfovercoming for them and many are right that in some sense the creation of israel is the most “antisemitic” act ever conceived
1578,it is in any case a great model for others to show that reestablishment of antiquity is fully possible although there is no real reason why americans or europeans should have any regard for the welfare of this country
1579,in their case too however by our time that spirit of piracy is long gone and they’ve gone so soft that on the streets of tel aviv you have yemeni “jewish” bluegums with rasta style feeling up ashkenazi girls and in general a feeling of torpor
1580,the condition of other modern nations is worse
1581,in our time friendship is made illegal between boys in school real fraternities are for all purposes banned and the scouting movements are forced to accept womenand women are destructive entirely of any great friendship
1582,in private life friendship among isolated and defeated modern males is unheard of
1583,men are deluded into thinking their wife can also be their best friend and this of course also makes their wives lose respect for them
1584,then also so many are rightly afraid of the way such relations have been sexualized between men and are never sure if a prospective friend has sexual intentionsat the same time as all this goes on gays act out a domesticized and castrated parody of friendship
1585,where to recover true friendship then
1586,in this case though more than in others how could they stop you if you only learned to listen to instinct and follow the pleasure of desires
1587,there’s nothing in principle that the state can do to stop you if you should give yourself over to real friendship
1588,all of the things i’ve said are a kind of conditioning a very strong conditioning but it’s all a form of psychological control that should in principle be easy to break
1589,all you need to do is give in to desire for great things
1590,the true foundation of the bronze age of the age of great adventuressuch a thing is a matter of the blood and spirit and for those few among you who are suited to it it should be as easy to recover as the carelessness that comes from filling yourself with the fire of the lifeforce
1591,you must only embrace your own instincts with abandon and understand that in common dedication to a higher cause a great friend is invaluable because you spur each other on and keep guard on each other in the mission
1592,55 superman mindset inside every noble greek was an unquenchable lust for power and this means power to become lord over life and death in your state
1593,it’s hard to understand what this means from looking around today because there’s nothing like it from the big examples you might have heard
1594,many of you might think of dictators in north korea or some public lavatory of the world or of the great total states of the last century but you’d be wrong
1595,these men weren’t really free or powerful in many ways they were hostage to their own security services
1596,someone like stalin was trapped in a stream of events where his freedom to operate existed only in the realm of murder and murder alone and any small step outside of this would mean his doom
1597,ideology is so tiresome
1598,these are “systems” of control that call on the mobilization of the entire society and the demands of this control far outweigh the capabilities of a single man
1599,in a monarchy he could delegate these tasks to ministers and concern himself with other projects but someone like stalin or mao can’t really do that
1600,you must understand that all true greatness is parasitic on matter for example the brain and nervous system are parasitic on the body for anything good to happen the capacity of the hegemon must exceed the demands made on it for attention management and control
1601,the analogy here would be a body with the lower organs so large and powerful their demands for control so overwhelming that the brain would be barely equal to the task and would remain entirely in their service although ruling or tyrannizing over them
1602,that is the kind of “modern dictator” you know about
1603,and the types of men that are drawn into this today are also quite different they are the kind of ideological martinet you meet every day among those who are “public spirited” and into “public service” it’s a kind of very aggressive schoolmarm type
1604,this is a lower kind of creature
1605,what i’m talking about is entirely different from public service but seeks to live like a parasite on the state and on the substance of its various factions to pursue quite different interests and desires
1606,they have interests alien to yours
1607,in the modern world this condition isn’t approached by dictators of totalitarian states but certain others i will describe soon
1608,in fact the great totalitarian states you know about weren’t that different from our own or the “liberal democracies” we live in the same kind of state only that it is more prosperous and the viciousness of the power is indirect and hidden
1609,but it is no less monstrous
1610,if anyone is free it certainly isn’t anyone you see or know about
1611,no greek that i talk about in any case would have enjoyed being the gofer of the national security and industrial state and its thousands of demands
1612,such men saw the prize of sovereignty as a meansa perch from where they could remain watchful over the state and of territory far outside it and swoop down like eagle for the prize in one swoop the king of birds catches its bloody prey in fast talons
1613,they were true artistes  take for example periander of corinth
1614,this man’s name means literally “superman” at no point in his life as king of corinth did he restrain his lust for the darkest paths it is said he copulated with his mother that he violated his wife’s corpse and much worse
1615,he had all the boys on the island corcyra castrated
1616,and having done all this he was memorialized as one of the sages or geniuses of the ancient world
1617,a philosopher and a poet he wrote an epic on the mysteries of nature that showed themselves to him alone on afternoons when the long shadows make the bluegreen shores of those seas whisper to ears ready to hear
1618,he supported also the art and philosophy of others in the state but only out of a careless generosity i was there at his court i played the harp and he once threw a wellused courtesan in my lap with a gesture of disdain
1619,it is true that he established his city as a great trading outpost bringing great wealth
1620,he also built the first railroad in historya kind of way to transport goods across the isthmus of corinth at the time a great innovation
1621,he did many other such thingshe established colonies abroad he built temples he chastised the nobles and raised up the middle classes but you must forgive these acts or rather not misunderstand them
1622,he never did any of this “for the good” out of duty or necessity but rather these actions flowed from those we consider vices as a kind of excess
1623,everything came from his instincts to conquer and expand the domain of his action
1624,born to power in his state he could have chosen a middle course
1625,if he had excessively enjoyed honorsor prestigeor security
1626,these were his to have and easily
1627,the great danger for a house passes once the son is able to succeed the father in seat of king
1628,but he gave all this up for really no reason
1629,he chose a path of adventure but he chose even a path of sorrow
1630,in all he did there was a kind of artistic sorrow and grotesque misfortune that he seemed to want to bring on himselfto make life interesting or so he could overcome even this latest outrage
1631,he killed his own wife and i know why
1632,she was pregnant and though he had copulated with her in a dream he received word that during the act a small snake had become attached to his member
1633,and that a monster would be born
1634,then it’s said that his son was murdered by those same people from corcyra that periander had made the subjects of his weird experiments but that they did so because they loved the youth
1635,but this is absurd
1636,the real reason was that he was trying to impregnate all the women on the island
1637,so periander dreamt he would become progenitor of a “brood of snakes” he only ever saw political office as a means to selfovercoming and selfperfection as a way to turn himself into a living work of art
1638,from this came for the citizens much good and also much bad
1639,it has to be expected that such men will appear as monsters to others
1640,in any case the things he did were hardly the worst
1641,one other man i can think of a tyrant or a king have it what you will he married off the women of his state to slaves through this overturning of values that he learned from plato he secured his infamy and power
1642,do you understand what plato’s republic means
1643,it is a formula for such men to unleash their complete madness on the world
1644,it teaches them certain tricks to expand the domain of their struggle for selfperfection into every area of social life
1645,plato himself says that the secret desire of every greek was to become a tyrant and nietzsche understands all the greatness of that people their exploration of the seas and limits of the world their foundation of the arts and sciencesall of this as just an extension of this secret desire in the heart of every noble greek
1646,it was the secret desire also in the heart of the great french artists and it is simply put the unlearnable desire behind all great things
1647,if you have it you must by no means restrain it
1648,this is because human nature is feeble and easily led astray and only when driven by this kind of monstrous and singleminded obsession for the heights of power can it find the motivation to overcome the lying dirty ape in us
1649,a certain distance too from oneself is necessary
1650,a “clinical” eye in regards to oneself one’s faults is required for this mindset
1651,in our time this can be achieved in part by embracing spirit of true science whereas for man of bronze age it was easy to embrace because he saw things that happened to him including the great motions of the spirit the feelings that troubled him as instantiations of various gods for which he was not responsible and which he could therefore judge and evaluate externally
1652,his view was however correct
1653,for this reason when you see men like periander you have to understand their special quest wasn’t one where they try to accomplish “the public good” nor was it some worthless desire to dominate others or exert will for petty satisfaction they see others instead as tools or objects on a mission of self overcoming
1654,he was trying to turn himself into a work of art his life into a replay of the great motions of the stars or the secret passion plays of the gods
1655,in the same way that the greek state in general was conceived as a work of art by the citizens
1656,periander understood his position as king then as just another means here science here art could be free from all limits and could rule unhindered and embark on great experiments
1657,and yet from all this you see something very strangethe secret desire of every greekthe bronze age mindsetwas to be worshiped as a god
1658,this is the secret target to which that boundless lust for power aims
1659,there are many other examples
1660,among the spartans you find the great general lysander
1661,he turned the spartans from a land power into a great navy defeated the athenians and ended the peloponnesian war then he went from city to city as a liberator on a great tour of self glorification
1662,he was the first to be worshiped as a god at altars
1663,he had searched for this his entire life and it was the prize of his victories
1664,there was another such unlikely man brasidas a spartan general of a generation before lysander of very unusual character
1665,he liberated many cities by his force of personality and the magical charisma that emanated from his body
1666,a spartan and man of battle and the science of war he nevertheless managed to win by persuasion and speech only such man with disdain for words can really understand what speech is really for
1667,he was type of man who when his back is against the wall the strong spirit in him rallies like wild boar who rages in his thick chest when he is cornered by hunters and charges for the kill
1668,in same way brasidas performed best when he relieved many cities of siege
1669,he died the most glorious death in the middle of victorious battle when he rushed into the thick of the enemy with his elite guard
1670,he was worshiped as a god thereafter in the city of amphipolis
1671,it’s not a surprise that you see men of this type of man come out of sparta the place that made the sternest demands on itself produced also the most brilliant men
1672,they went rogue and easily imposed the intensity of their magic charisma on foreigners
1673,true power needs no effort it draws all around it like a forcefield
1674,power of character and body attracts others in orbit as if by magic
1675,56 in iliad you see the greatest warriors rise up to fight even the gods
1676,when diomedes is about to go on his great rampage athena the whiteeyed appears to him and whispers in his ear
1677,she reminds him of his father’s great feats and breathes strength into his chest she tells him to go fearlessly into the throng of the enemy on his chariot and in this exalted condition she draws back from his eyes the veil that had previously hidden the gods
1678,she tells him that if that harlot aphrodite appears he has the power to harm her
1679,and diomedes does this without any fear
1680,even the goddess of love is laid low before the aroused might of a warrior on rampage
1681,achilles too in his great moment chastises the river god and makes him submit
1682,this reflects one great truth that in this condition of aroused spirit the true man is given the gift of heightened perception and can see things that others can’t
1683,this is what is meant by the fact that the genius sees this same world we do but sees in it things that we can’t much like we see things that dog or ant can’t
1684,indeed time itself entirely changes when the will is raised up to this height the warrior in some way can be said to rise outside the stream of events in which we are held like prisoners
1685,in this condition he appears magnified anointed and others who are not privy to the same things begin to orbit around him physically and spiritually in the bible too you see in the middle of battle for jerusalem “the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord” before the many who subject themselves in awe to this great gift
1686,in same way in their moments of great glory athena kindles on the neck and head and shoulders of the warriors a great fire that can be seen from far away
1687,she does this for diomedes and for achilles as they let loose their strength on a wild rampage a great bonfire explodes on their body and behind them
1688,this is the irresistible power of charisma and strength that draws all to it like magic for man this is no less true than it is for migratory birds on mission for pack of wolves on the hunt for hives of bees in all cases the many begin to orbit around the anointed hegemon as if by magic
1689,it’s a biological compulsion and a great good
1690,and you must understand one thing the end of achilles’ mission was the total destruction of the city of troy the fire melting the brick of its alleys its men killed its women and children sold into slavery
1691,this last was held to be the right of conquerors throughout the history of the greek world or at least for its vital period of ascent
1692,thus this most humane and refined of ancient peoples found it absolutely necessary nevertheless to have this out for the wolfish and predatory instinct in man
1693,war alone brought rejuvenation of their nature
1694,when alexander drags the body of the rulers of tyre outside the city walls from his chariot and circles around the city he is copying what achilles did to hector when the city of troy was annihilated
1695,nietzsche sees in this an excess something unfortunatebut i tell you he means something else
1696,when city is destroyed its gods are destroyed you must remember that each city had its tutelary gods and spirits for protection
1697,the romans before they conquered a new city promised the gods of that city that they would honor and respect them tenfold more than the inhabitants
1698,when a city or culture is destroyed gods are destroyed with it
1699,the destruction of the cities in fire that the greatest warriors of antiquity took upon themselves was a form of divine warfare
1700,and it was only possible because such men knew also how to listen to the voice of the gods and allowed themselves to be entirely possessed by a divine madness
1701,it imbued them with superhuman strength and drew others into their designs by instinct
1702,this abandon to nature and instinctthis is the bronze age way
1703,and you can learn to cultivate this exalted psychosis inside you also
1704,57 i see no reason why if there should be epidemics of all kinds of diseases the same can’t also be true for what we call “mental disease” and you see repetitions of this throughout history and even now among primitives in sudan when they become possessed of fears that wandering jews are spreading penis modifying bananas or that shaking hands can destroy your genitalia or such things
1705,this is funny but in all eruptions of this kind of superstition i see a divine significance and great potential
1706,in europe there used to be the mania called st vitus’ dance and in ancient greece the cults of dionysus spreading the madness of maenads and turning the women into hungry cannibalistic sluts
1707,i say this in “sexpositive” way
1708,i believe any child born of such excesses is likely to be blessed because here the genius of the species is allowed to make the choice without any interference
1709,this is not endorsement of anything in our time there is nothing like this it’s just larp’ing
1710,you’ve been abandoned by the gods
1711,only a global orgy of fire will whet their appetites for return
1712,58 you make fun of “decadent” roman emperors
1713,in the horror stories from suetonius you have prototype of “monarchy gone wild” of mad emperors who use position only to satisfy arcane and criminal lusts
1714,i don’t write to defend such things but the condemnation isn’t moralhow can it be when my reaction at reading excesses of caligula or nero or tiberius is to feel a great sense of loss or envy at what they could do that i can’t
1715,caligula had the genius idea to form a long line of ships on the sea put platforms on top of them fill them with earth so that he could fulfill a prophecy of walking on water between two points
1716,he gathered the army on the seashore facing britain and ordered them instead of invading to collect seashells
1717,he then called this a great booty for the roman people and the senate and threw a few pennies at the soldiers saying “go happy
1718,go rich” he captured two gauls but dressed them up in icenigger face to look like teutons and then enacted an obviously transparent “hunt” to pretend he had captured them in front of the soldiers
1719,everyone laughed and rolled their eyes for sure
1720,but he was caught up in the story of his own godhood
1721,at rome he used to lock down the colosseum during the hottest hours and withdraw the awnings so that the people would suffer in the heat and pregnant women wouldn’t be able to leave
1722,sometimes he replaced the regular gladiator shows with pathetic fights between cripples and deformed animals he would lock down the granaries to let the people go hungry for no reason at all
1723,he was the greatest troll ever
1724,when the jews of alexandria came to complain about civil war simmering in that city he ignored their pleas and asked them why they don’t eat pork
1725,when you look at elagabalus you see this tendency taken to its logical conclusion this man was a trapemperor and asked his doctors to give him a sex change operation
1726,it is believed he was a devotee of cybele and like the insane priests of that cultwanted to castrate himself
1727,instead of this he became a prostitute inside the palace and used to publicly give himself airs over how much he was making
1728,commodus became a gladiator and found great pride in his swordplay although such things aren’t so strange to imagine in our time and they are to be welcomed
1729,nero was a pioneer of gay marriage
1730,the first time he did it as the groom and the second as the bride he made the old senators listen as he mimicked the sounds of a young wife getting deflowered behind the doors
1731,of all his exploits i found most fascinating that he put on the mask of a lion and having tied up various men and women naked in his mansion on the island came at them with the rage of a beast and in a frenzy bit at their bodies and genitals
1732,i don’t celebrate any of this but i think when in our age elites are accused of similar behaviorthis isn’t righti think we flatter ourselves
1733,we want to think they’re a lot more interesting than they areit’s easier to think we’re ruled by demons than by defectives who would normally be running a smokedfish stand or running vodka parlors outside minsk
1734,we don’t want to admit that we’re as lame in vice and deviance as we are in greatness and for the same reasons
1735,you see these old wet rags of an “elite” getting arrested and in almost every case it’s for something on the level of a pee wee monkeyshow selfexposure in a porn cinema masturbating themselves in front of some frigid cinema whore with leatherface and bugged out eyes exposing their weapons of mass destruction to a dominican maid
1736,it’s hard to understand what even goes into this kind of “decadence” but it’s of a different kind from the excesses of the worst roman emperors who even when they were trannies seem more manly and brave than our perverts
1737,i wonder if it’s not possible to think of history in entirely different way i mean all we think now is from point of view of the people and the story goes about progress or regress with respect to how they fare or at best how something like science or hygiene advances or technology or moral responsibility or equality or inequality or anything else you wantadvances or not
1738,but history would look very different if pursued with eye of connoisseur for superior specimens judging them as you would prized steers or stallions
1739,in such case you would have to dismiss these kinds of freaks like the emperors i mentioned and judge them defectivebut for entirely different reasons
1740,you would learn to see history from view of life and biology as great bestiaryand learn what is necessary in our time also to make way for the longlost tropics and junglethe abode of the godsthat can returnand return 59 i always loved the statues of the kouroi
1741,i can safely say that upon viewing such statue by myself for three hours someone let me in to look alone in museum i was able to ejaculate without touching myself
1742,but i had no dirty or untoward thoughts the entire time
1743,this experience made me wonderif it is possible to ejaculate without touching yourself is it possible also to will yourself to death just the same without doing anything
1744,the kouroi have long story behind them you might have heard
1745,at first these statues were copied from egyptian models but they became much more realistic in the hands of the craftsman of the archaic greeks also much brawnier and more muscular
1746,the pose is still stylized and the smile they have on their face is very enigmatic almost like you think they could crush big stone on your head or run iron blade through your sternum and have that stoney autistic smile unchanged while looking you in the eye
1747,two brothers of this type had to carry their mother to a religious feast
1748,it is story of kleobis and biton twins
1749,she couldn’t get there on her own so they carried her on a kind of palanquin rushing with great force up the steps to the temple
1750,they presented her in time to the sacred procession but both died from the great exertion
1751,herodotus says solon told this story to croesus of lydia who was one of the first selfmade kings we know from history
1752,croesus took his state by force with the help of a company of elite warriors
1753,he was the one who made the first coins to pay his mercs
1754,he ruled outside all limits and pursued the way of power
1755,in this he inspired many to similar actions
1756,but solon the wise founding father of athens you could say a famous lawgiver went to visit him
1757,he asked solon to tell him about people who lived a happy life and solon told him this story of the brothers
1758,the full story says that after the twins performed this great athletic feat and delivered their mother in time to the sacred feast she asked the goddess hera to which she was dear for a great reward
1759,and the goddess gave this reward that the twin sons would lie down in the temple for a deep sleep and never awake
1760,this is idea of a greek
1761,of a happy life
1762,this story confused croesus the king and it probably confuses you
1763,it’s strange to see how far the greeks took aesthetic understanding of life and the world
1764,there is no moral lesson in this story at all
1765,any moral lesson that you could think of for example of duty to parents or to tradition could have been made in different way
1766,what’s unusual here is the ending
1767,there is just biology it is best for the end and the acme to coincide
1768,a beautiful death at the right time is the only key to understanding a life its only hidden “meaning” it is a beautiful death to die after accomplishing a great feat for the glory of one’s city family and for the gods but it’s greater still to die in one’s prime at the height of your powers and at the acme of their discharge
1769,a beautiful death in youth is a great thing to leave behind a beautiful body and the best study of this pursuit you find in the novels of mishima a real connoisseur
1770,60 the most glamorous christian prince for me was always young conradin king of the romans and king of jerusalem
1771,he was unjustly killed in italy by usurper charles of anjou with the contrivance of a corrupt pope
1772,he came from an illustrious family
1773,his grandfather was the emperor frederick ii hohenstaufen called stupor mundi and celebrated by nietzsche
1774,his beauty was said to be resplendent like that of his halfbrother manfred who was holding much of italy by force of charisma and arms while conradin was still a small boy
1775,upon reaching age at thirteen or fourteen conradin embarked with his few but powerful knights southward to reclaim his rightful throne in rome
1776,he defeated the usurper and then entered the city
1777,riding at the head of his column of knights in all their full armor with the imperial banners raised highthis was a glorious day all the people came to the streets to welcome their beloved liberator and showered the procession with many flowers
1778,the outpouring of love for this boy was like something that hadn’t been seen since the age of the empire and this alarmed the pope and all the sclerotic prelates as much as this boy’s grandfather had if not more
1779,conradin was just thirteen or fourteen but he refused all orders to wait and never listened to the timid counsels of his advisors who tried to hold him back from his acme
1780,he entered rome as world conqueror
1781,thereafter came a series of disasters his army lost a great battle in the south despite a successful first charge and mostly through the inadequacy of some of his auxiliaries
1782,he was captured by treachery and then charles of anjou with the help of corrupt jurists found a legal pretext to put him on trial and behead him and a friend
1783,you might think this is very bad and certainly it would have been better to die in the middle of battle but much can be excused by his youth
1784,and it must be said that he never compromised or begged for his life
1785,his execution was so absurd and unjust that it permanently discredited charles of anjou the usurper
1786,it discredited too this kind of papal “legalism” that must sound very familiar to you now
1787,still more so it permanently discredited the aggressive papacy that promoted a man the people of sicily and italyas well as most of the german statesviewed as an arrogant nearlyautistic and unjust upstart
1788,this charles was ever driven in his life by the hatred that came from being slighted in his youth by his mother and other relatives
1789,he was a man driven by a sclerotic lust for power and crude ambitions where conradin was carried by the native charisma common in his family by his beauty his careless courage
1790,he was riding to seat of worldruler purely through naïve trust in his own glamor
1791,know that despite all force and treachery and contrivance all public sanctions and honors the people will not be fooled they know the real man of power and can tell the difference from a deformed usurper
1792,charles’ execution of conradin was lamented by all germany and much of italy
1793,now the robots who run our world also want to be loved or feared and are trembling because the people don’t respect them
1794,they too the nations of our time seek the return of youth of a conradin
1795,it seemed to the peoples of that time a story of the promise of youth the beauty and purity of its intentions extirpated by the old and ugly
1796,so that in the end the memory of the young prince was victorious
1797,not long after this the peoples of sicily conspired with the house of aragon ruled by relatives of conradin and broke the power of charles in a revolt
1798,this was the end of idea of “universal monarchy” through the papacyand this was the beginning of the national consciousness in europe
1799,the memory of conradin was prized as the promise of beauty and youth memorialized in epics and poetry that rejuvenated the peoples of europe and awoke them
1800,though he died without achieving his goal he died as a martyr for europe against asia and inspired the birth of the new statethe springboard of world conquest that was soon to come in the age of exploration and colonization
1801,christianity is a versatile faith capable of many interpretations
1802,i believe conradin was the most christian prince but also might as well have been the renewed avatar of apollo in europe recalling very old memories
1803,it was the spirit of fire and youth renewing the peoples through its magnetic power and then through the sacrifice of its blood
1804,in moments of torpor we can always return to this spirit of the ancient greeks as a tonic
1805,61 crusaders like cortes and pizarro fernando de soto drake and raleigh magellan and balboa equal in daring intelligence magnitude of spirit resourcefulness and achievement any of the great men of the greeks and romans
1806,the story of the heroic age of exploration remains to be told in full and maybe one of you one day will make big book or big movies
1807,i say also now for those who seek to make a difference and have some artistic or visual bent movies are the golden key to the minds of the many
1808,what mel gibson does is worth a thousand books or “activisms” for your side
1809,learn to make movies if you can and you can start with video
1810,in any case there is just one great epic that tells the story in its proper form the great poem of camoes a man born to piracy and high adventure
1811,this man lost an eye in war in ceuta against the moor he then lived as a brigand and vagabond in imperial lisbon getting into one duel and fight after another composing poetry getting drunk
1812,his mother saved him from prison but he was pressed into service in the colonial navy and army
1813,he arrived in goa and from there participated in many adventures military and diplomatic as a man of low rank but high spirits
1814,all the while he was writing his great poem the lusiad and when he was shipwrecked off the mekong with his chinese girlfriend he carried the text of this timeless work above his head to save it from the water
1815,no one reads it anymore and his life would make a great movie
1816,but he is right that the voyages of these new crusaders equal any great expedition even from the myths and legends of the past
1817,here we have jason’s argo made anew and not just once but in every one of these nations of the west
1818,england’s glory during these years might never be equaled again by any people
1819,even the kings of portugal who started the age of colonization and exploration had english blood
1820,the gothic restlessness of the steppe shook in the lords of iberia with a titanic energy
1821,before the great voyage to the orient of vasco da gama spiesand i mean just one or two menwent alone on expeditions in egypt and down the red sea into the heart of arabia fearlessly incognito to collect information crucial for the coming expedition
1822,perched on the beaches of the great eurasian mass these men went in just a hundred years from sailing a few almostrafts that they barely knew how to navigate to explorers of new worlds and founders of global empires that lasted for centuries
1823,you must understand how amazing this feat was there was no tradition of seamanship in portugal or spain let alone france or englandit all had to be done from scratch
1824,do you know at all to respect the sea
1825,if you’ve ever traveled a ferry on even a relatively calm sea like the adriatic on a windy day a large modern ferry as big as a city blockit will swing right and left
1826,you won’t be used to it
1827,the atlantic has waves ten feet or more as a matter of course and these men were traveling on wooden ships with 15 th century tech you must be crazy to have no awe of this
1828,for romance of the sea you should read melville
1829,columbus is celebrated yes but there were others who were even greater than him or at least his equal and few know about them
1830,they don’t receive the glory they deserve because first many of the writers who could have done this were prejudiced against their strong religious faith and their piety you see most of the modern glorifiers of antiquity usually had an axe to grind against christianity or the church so they didn’t want to promote these men or admit that the champions of the faith were the most shining exemplars of the classical man in our time
1831,even nietzsche stays away from them and in a moment of weakness speaks nonsense about the “superiority” of the aztecs
1832,on the other hand the church has been embarrassed about these men
1833,more than anyone else they spread its power and gospel through the world and even before that they saved europe itself from the moors and the other threats
1834,they’re the direct descendants of the crusaders who liberated spain and other parts of europe
1835,the church doesn’t want to admit that once ferdinand and isabella cleared spain of the enemies of christ god blessed that nation with a century of prosperity and preeminence and gave it the foundation of worldempire
1836,but the church was embarrassed by them by the conquistadores by their cruelty and their pagan love of vitality and action so it tried to disavow them while making use of their strength
1837,so their story remains largely untold although it’s one of the peaks of history and of manly achievement
1838,few understand the voyages for example of even one of the most famous among them vasco da gama and how in many ways it exceeded the feats of columbus
1839,this man circumnavigated africa and found the sea route to the indieswhat columbus had actually set out to do or so the story goesi believe columbus had some secret maps such voyage was attempted long before by the phoenician hanno but no one knows what really came of that
1840,the travel was difficult
1841,when you reach a certain point of the west african coast you can’t just continue to hug along ityou have to pull out to the west and swoop aroundthis is likely how south america was discovered
1842,do you know what starvation scurvy and tropical disease is
1843,do you understand tropical heat
1844,sure some of you might but know that off the west africa coast when a wind blows in your face it’s not a relief it’s like a hairdryer going off in your face nonstop
1845,and yet he reached india he found spices he found monkey he made the zamorin submit with big guns
1846,his investors made thousands of percent return
1847,just seven years later another conquistador returned almeida with a great armada that tore a swathe of destruction along the indian ocean
1848,he burned down mombasa though outnumbered because of the arrogance of its arab rulersimagine the stench that must have wafted as far as japan
1849,this man defeated a huge armada of ottomans arabs mamelukes at the battle of diu to avenge the death of his son and this was momentous time
1850,space itself on our world changed
1851,the great overland routes of trade were now outflanked by the seafaring nations of western europe which from this moment began to dominate the indian ocean and the pacific
1852,do you understand america had a great destiny in this design as well
1853,when the colonists founded jamestown let’s say there were no more than two hundred or two hundred and fifty years from that act to the time of commodore perry the american people had tamed the continent and pushed their way to asia across the seas in no time at all
1854,it would have happened even faster if they hadn’t been hampered by the domination of englandonce they gained their independence their expansion was very fast the constitution the ideology the doctrine of rights is all so much nonsense and has nothing to do with any of thisit barely all even lasted through the lifetimes of the founders of america who were seeking merely dominion and freedom of space to expand
1855,the great destiny of america had always been the conquest of the far east and the domination of china which obsessed the leading minds of that time
1856,all of this has now been forgotten and america’s great fate has been thwartedat least for now
1857,what do you know then of men like this or of afonso de albuquerque who followed almeida who captured hormuz and muscat with seven ships who opened the way to the spice islands of legend
1858,i prefer as usual not to talk of such men they are so far from your possibilities that the example is almost depressing
1859,i want to encourage you again with someone else from this age a man more to my taste and more within the realm of what is possible of what is about to become possible again
1860,this is the brilliant righthandman of cortes pedro de alvarado
1861,he was a man of knightly family from southern spain but had fiery redblond hair which amazed the mexicas they believed he was a child of the sun and called him tonatiuh the mane of the sun
1862,he was of boundless courage carelessness and also boundless cruelty
1863,cortes left him in charge briefly in tenochtitlan where he massacred all the aztec nobles in the great temple during a banquetfor no reason at all
1864,during the battles he distinguished himself by insane charges into the thick of the enemy by which he was outnumbered by hundreds to one yet he never lost heart he went right for their garish flowerdecorated lieutenants and cut them down striking fear into the multitude
1865,don’t believe the lies about gunpowder
1866,guns were very basic at this time and on many occasions the spanish didn’t have guns at all
1867,the armor the pikes the toledo steel blades the discipline and knowhow from decades of fighting the moorall of this was far more important
1868,and above all bravery and daring the same that led pizarro to take down an empire with a retinue of thirteen men
1869,what i want to say about alvarado though is this once conquests were made he never stopped
1870,his thirst for space for new worlds for new conquests was without end
1871,in his letters you see this is his only interest
1872,though made governor of a huge areathe presentday states of guatemala of honduras these are his creationshe nevertheless showed no interest at all in ruling them
1873,he squeezed them of whatever money he could never paying any taxes back to spain and always planned new adventures and new conquests
1874,this man was a born pirate right before his death he was planning a great expedition for the conquest of china and the spice islands
1875,alvarado was a nemesis to civilization and this is right and good
1876,god sends such men to chastise mankind
1877,i want you to be like this to listen to these instincts in you
1878,when he was put in charge of territory alvarado could have very easily settled down to the life of a governor most men would
1879,enticed by the prestige and honor they would play the part then also their vanity would fool them into thinking that they could govern well
1880,well maybe you can govern well or maybe you can’t
1881,but alvarado knew what he was
1882,and he didn’t try to be more than one thing
1883,be one thing
1884,singleminded purity of purpose is true manliness
1885,he knew he was a born beast of prey and never pretended to be more or less than this
1886,this selfassured sense of who he was made him insanely attractive even to the natives he oppressed and massacred despite his cruelty they couldn’t help being drawn to his charm his lofty manner his outrageous magnificence
1887,they worshiped him as a god
1888,the other spaniards were in awe as well
1889,you must see that nature blesses all men who have faith in their own blood and in their instinctsnature blesses them with such magnetism
1890,alvarado is the avatar of our new age and i predict this within fifty years a hundred alvarados will bloom from deep in the tropical bestiary of the spirit
1891,they will sweep away the weakness of this world
1892,62 bob denard shows that the spirit of bronze age pirate can exist also in our age
1893,it can flower complete and unedited
1894,you have no excuse
1895,this man may not be what you expect
1896,how different he is from the pretentious bureaucrats we see the politicians with their highflown language their tedious moral preaching their careful selfpositioning timidity and the drudgery to which they subject themselves
1897,men who embrace highflown moral principle in public are usually looked down on by many regular people they can smell the bullshit from far away
1898,he started out as a regular soldier with the french in vietnam but he was courtmartialed after he burned down a barpart of a dispute you see
1899,some men chimp out by writing a complaint others by getting in a bar fight others by burning down the building
1900,after this he wandered around africa finding odd jobs in the employ of local nabobs and potentates all of them utterly corrupt and incompetent
1901,he said once something like “it’s important never to be ‘ambitious’ men of ‘ambition’ are losers
1902,act and feel like a winner and good things friends and victory will come” he took part in adventures all over africa coups in benin the congo secessionist movements like in biafra the french styling on english nigeria and so forth
1903,his greatest feat was to overthrow the government of the comoros four times
1904,each time france had to send special forces to the islands to dislodge him
1905,otherwise he would have surely become a hereditary ruler
1906,he had many wives and won many properties by the power of his hand
1907,at the end of his lifewellthis life lasted too long
1908,he should have died in defense of his territory younger and without descending into the dementia and pain that took him in old age
1909,france repaid his service with persecution no longer needed to fight communists in africa his vainglory and ferocity became a liability
1910,now if you need great moral elevation if war must be in the service of a good cause you can consider his service in congo in katanga and then against the simba rebels
1911,at stanleyville he along with only a handful of other white mercenaries freed thousands of hostages from rape and sure massacre at the hands of the savage simbas
1912,in many ways he defended whatever residues of civilization remained in africa after decolonization
1913,in this last venture he was joined by a man of similar temperament the colonel “mad mike” hoare
1914,this is another great example of the modern rebirth of bronze age vitalism
1915,and another example of why you’re a fag
1916,an irishenglish dandy he was a gentleman among soldiers but a man before being a gentleman he remained throughout his life singleminded brutal and coolheaded in the middle of conflicts where he was outnumbered thousands to one swamped by the demented zombi hordes of the tropics
1917,this man understood communism for what it was the infestation of vermin he was tasked to exterminate a biological event not an ideological political or historical one
1918,after the war in burma he made a living working on safaris and then like denard gaining experience in the service of various african governments
1919,he led an elite unit of mercs in the congo and in the same operation with denard was responsible for relieving stanleyville and saving a hundred nuns and missionaries from rape and torture
1920,thereafter he led many missions in africa a new frontier
1921,he was later involved in an aborted coup on the seychelles
1922,failure is not dishonorable as long as you are making a great gamble for great gains
1923,it isn’t right to judge such people by the “justice” of their cause
1924,some of you spergs and almost all of the half educated class think when nietzsche talks about “beyond good and evil” that he’s making some grand proposition about there being no possibility to evaluate men or events
1925,morality is absolute necessity for the people
1926,there is the other morality that reveals a biological hierarchy
1927,just the same a different standard applies to huemans and a different one to the true men who are willing to live in danger and who don’t care for their animal lives
1928,men like denard and hoare are a great attempt on the part of nature itself they show that even in our age there are men who yearn inscribe their wills in bronze for the ages who want their terrible creations to endure for centuries
1929,they should be judged by what they were willing to risk in their spiritand also by the unequaled rush they all must have had inside them as they pursued their high aims
1930,even just a few years ago margaret thatcher’s son mark was given a sentence in south africa in 2005 for an attempted coup in equatorial guinea
1931,he was ratted out and caught at the airport
1932,you must understand that the meddlesome little cretinoids who run the west always put a stop to great plans and great actions
1933,they’ve ended many promising adventures through their snoopingthey’re tattletales always watching never sleeping always whispering
1934,gallant men who live under the sign of the lion are stopped before they can act
1935,a different way is necessary
1936,but i mean to say don’t be fooled in our age too men of adamantine character exist who fight like capaneus before thebes ready nude with fire in arm to burn down city
1937,they appear now as villain now as hero to the people but you must learn to forget just this desire of the people and yearn rather to live dangerously and do great deeds for good or evil
1938,the danger of our time is not that it makes people bad but that it makes everything small and afraid
1939,neall ellis in his trusty mi24 hind helicopter held off the rebels in the sierra leone civil war singlehandedly and saved innumerable lives
1940,there’s little glamor in his job and in the end it didn’t matter but on his trusty flying hind steed he must have felt like a beast of prey swooping down on the enemy
1941,he worked for company executive outcomesa name that might make you think of second rate consulting company in office park
1942,but this was merc company that ended the civil war in sierra leone and threatened to establish a new order all over africa
1943,for this reason they were stopped by the un by gangs of international lawyers and financiers who fear the power of the new sea peoples
1944,how long can they hold off such men from their destiny
1945,in the rhodesian war you had companies of a few white farmers raised in the bush who ambushed armies of zambia and mozambique many thousands strong
1946,they would attack with stealth stalking them inflict frightful casualties and escape unharmed
1947,many such stories look up nyadzonya raid
1948,the potential for adventures and conquests like european man has rarely experienced in the past still exists and i have no doubt that in the coming years such opportunities will become ever more frequent
1949,the great leviathan will falter sooner or later
1950,the coming age of barbarism will not be owned as so many of you urban cucks fear by the gangbangers and the unwashed hordes of the teeming cesspools of the world but by cleancut middleclass and workingclass vets men of military experience who know something about how to shoot and how to organize
1951,the fools who think oligarchs will be able to control these men for very long should look to the fortunes of the sforzas and many others and remember that money is no match for force of arms combined with charm
1952,when theodore roosevelt was i think close to seventy years old he went on expedition to the amazon then mostly still unexplored he called it one last chance to be a boy
1953,this expedition led to his death and it was a good death
1954,he followed in footsteps of men of power like lope de aguirreand never lost the yearning in his heart for eldorado
1955,part four a few arrows 63 giving “freedom” to women an impossibility
1956,with the liberation of women in the 19 th century the west has given itself an infection from which it can’t recover without the most terrible convulsions and the most thorough purgative measures
1957,what the “freedom” of women means in practice is the domination of mankind by the demagogues who can rally the lower orders of the spirit
1958,because there is no world in which “the women” can act as a political unit
1959,liberation of women means freedom and power for financiers lawyers purveyors of comforts in and outside government employers who whore out your wife and daughters
1960,it has been the greatest weakening and selfown a civilization has ever visited on itself
1961,but in the end is this so different from democracy as such
1962,yesbecause the “liberation” of women makes democracy into a terminal diseaseone that doesn’t just end a particular government but the civilization
1963,64 if you wonder how mankind fell from the high times of the renaissance and the age of exploration to our times of mediocrity and repressioni can only tell you this that our age is the norm in history
1964,it takes great efforts and much good luck to be able to surpass the dirty ape and rat inside us all
1965,most of mankind never left the regime of deformity and it’s no surprise that this morass is returning
1966,it’s just a reversion to the norm
1967,that said there does seem to be something especially menacing about developments in our age the ubiquity of this leviathan the inability to escape it
1968,everywhere you might become a hermit you are reminded of it it intrudes everywhere
1969,and so the very success of the great men of four hundred years ago their foundation of a new world the great expansion of human knowledge and knowhowthis ended up setting the stage for our trashworld
1970,they succeeded beyond what they could expect and that success is what allowed the profusion of the lower types of mankind
1971,in nature the vital part of mankind would rule and in the beginnings of many societies it does military brotherhoods of men rule and physical force as well as force of personality charisma draw the rest in an orbit around those who possess these in the highest degree
1972,this is all by a natural and secret pull by instinct
1973,there is a magic to charisma that does this and the military monarchical organization the rule of the warlord comes from desire for this in the nature of all not from reflection and abstraction
1974,unfortunately some things conspire to end this original condition of mankind which is itself no paradise and is full of strife suffering and problems
1975,these things are first of all the very success of these men in securing the conditions of life and comfort for the rest of the community
1976,second the ascent within this peacetime of the priest the shaman the schemer and the matriarch which slowly usurp power away from the brotherhoods of young men and their captains
1977,spinoza explains the corruption of the jewish people in just this way the hebrew “republic” was in fact a military regime of the type i say here a rule of the captains
1978,but the priests took this power away and corrupted the nation to weakness
1979,in same way something happened to the aryans in india and in many other places
1980,this state of things doesn’t need to be so the men of religion and those of power have many interests in common and can rule together
1981,but it often happens that the men of power become decadent and let the state drift into the hands of those who can’t ruleand who start to resent them for this abdication
1982,women become also very aggressive once real and relaxed manhood atrophies
1983,if you imagine that women in the muslim world for example are sweet and femininethey are hungry viragos of iron will
1984,the feminist muslima will be a figure of much importance among them
1985,the men in arabia will turn gay
1986,the vietnamese or chinese grandmother has her knee on the neck of the soninlaw
1987,thus everywhere we see that the very comforts and safety produced by the best men leads to the usurpation of society by those parts of the human spirit that are oriented instead toward a different kind of life that everywhere that mode of the yeast wins outand usually wins out very quickly
1988,and in the west whose special fate has been confused for history or progress of the entire species this development has taken place through the promotion of logos or reason and all the manifestations of this the adulation of empty words of legalism as a guide for social and political life of the cult of science that is very far from real science
1989,all of this has been a cover for the ascent of the blob human of the lower orders of the spirit and is instead delivering not just the west but all of mankind to a condition of domestic brokenness and servility
1990,very concretely you see in feminism the return of prearyan matriarchy
1991,the great “earth mother” originally some kind of halfhueman halfcockroach creature resplendent with horrid eggs like big amazon centipedethis seeks to re absorb you
1992,of all the things that you blame for the decrepit times we live in feminism and the “liberation” of women is both the proximate and the ultimate cause
1993,nothing so ridiculous as the liberation of women has ever been attempted in the history of mankind
1994,it is an act of complete insanity disguised as “logic” “reason” presented in the most absurd legalisms about supposed “rights” the modern socialisms the expansion of the power of the state that squashes all initiative and all life the hypocrisy of all political life in our timeall of this is to be attributed to the participation of women in political life
1995,i don’t complain about the “freedom” or “degeneracy” that supposedly comes from this arrangement
1996,that’s all misdirection and selfflattery
1997,the state we live in is as repressive as any oriental tyranny
1998,but its hypocrisy is that it hides its force under the delusion of egalitarian ideals and legalistic procedures inconsistently applied
1999,it is not women actually being free but their “legal freedom” a practical fiction being used by a hidden power to oppress to dispossess to intimidate and extort
2000,it took one hundred years of women in public life for them to almost totally destroy a civilization
2001,but you would be a sperg to think that this problem can be solved by taking away women’s voting power “forcing” them into the home or some such thing
2002,the presence of women in public life is a spear with two tips and can be turned on the enemy with some ease
2003,women after all can still even in the most debased condition be made to call on their deep passions by a great leader
2004,they voted for hitler mussolini and many others with some enthusiasm
2005,the enemy who “freed” them has made use of a great weapon he has increased his power immensely and introduced a war into the house and life of every man
2006,but this enemy also made a gamble and i believe ultimately a mistakebecause women more than others will set their bodies on fire with passion for a savior and be willing to abandon the fear and love of comfort on which the modern state dependsthem more than others out of a wild and stupid enthusiasm
2007,65 how was it possible for women to become “free” at some point in the 19 th centuryhow did this agitation come about
2008,from where comes the gynocracy that rules not just as in tribal societies covertly but that now pretends also to be in the public sphere and to demand “rights”
2009,who was there in the first place to give rightsand of what use is a right if it’s not also a privilege
2010,the answer to all this is a little bit more unpleasant
2011,it’s only because women lost all respect for the males of the time that there could be any pretext like feminism or “women’s suffrage” in the first place
2012,the loss of respect in general marks the modern age since 1800 or so the loss of respect in authority for example that came when industrialists and bankers replaced the warrior nobility
2013,as “decadent” as the latter had become this class had never really lost its grace of manner its beauty and magnificence and glamor this made the common man more eager to submit or to accept such leadership
2014,but who could accept the rule of the dour economic creature that took the lead in the states at the end of the 18 th century
2015,this is why napoleon was such an enigma for so many he represented a man out of time something completely unexpected in the age of middle class mediocrity and hypocritical “democracy” that was just then coming about
2016,for this reason all the higher spirits of the 19 th century all the great artists the writers they threw themselves at the feet of his memory he seemed to represent the possibility of higher aspirations in our time
2017,you can read stendhal for this spirit
2018,napoleon was an escape from the domination of the bugman that was just then beginning to take hold of the nations
2019,now don’t imagine i will attack “the bourgeois”  we’ve declined so far even from the level of the bourgeois of that agein our time the desolation is almost complete
2020,this is why it’s so ridiculous to hear these “conservatives” yap on about honor or glory or sacrifice or any of this garbage
2021,the respect in all institutions and all leadership classes and all traditional authority has already been lost long ago and for good reason
2022,it’s impossible for the erased males to command any respect from the peopleand still less from their women
2023,feminism then is the revolt of women against the outrage of democracy
2024,they have been in a revolt against the inability of the bugman to command authority or respect
2025,and you must understand that there is no bottom to this “freedom” or revolution
2026,there won’t be any opportunity to say “i told you so” they will never “learn a lesson” from their foolishness
2027,and they resent the insecurity you have put them in
2028,the calamity that will surely follow from going down this path will not be a “teachable moment” to anyone
2029,they resent the “beta” but you’re wrong to think it was ever any different
2030,no great civilizations and cultures were never founded nor kept alive by “betas” the nerdoids who have taken over much of the right have brainwashed you to this view but it’s wrong
2031,women never loved the shopkeeper the timid merchant with the nasal voice and no not even the clockmaker or craftsman
2032,they have always loved the knight the sailor in love with wild ideas of the sea the adventurer and pirate
2033,and it is right that they loved these men and that with the coming of the rule of the bugman they would try to seek their “liberation” from unworthy men and the boring society they were building
2034,that this resentment was manipulated itself by the satanic power that rules our time and that through this very drive for freedom woman became enslaved more than she had been beforeis beside the point
2035,you won’t be able to make women “see reason” and love a “beta civilization”a fabrication of the hbd cuckold crowd of our time
2036,women will love you if you are a warrior
2037,and they will help through the entirely retarded mechanism of democracy to elect men of glamor and charisma who are our only immediate hope against the machine that runs our garbage world
2038,trump for all his hesitations is only the beginning
2039,he has shown the path insofar as woman is concerned
2040,the mob also is a woman
2041,now imagine a man of trump’s charisma but who is not merely beholden to the generals but one of them and able to rule and intimidate them as well as seduce the many
2042,so far we have only had gracchi but caesars and napoleons are sure to follow
2043,66 a man of great charisma who can seduce the people with a wild spirit and break through the rule of the pervasive bureaucracymedia complex is our best hope for the immediate problemand maybe our only hope
2044,such a man might be among you and in any case he will need help
2045,our enemy has so much spread he is everywhere
2046,he’s in your home even and he’s inside you
2047,the domain of the fight has extended everywhere now
2048,therefore any answer must be on multiple fronts and each one calls for a different strategy and different type of talent and man
2049,i fear that many of you are actually autists and spergs and don’t want to see this
2050,there is no one fight and no one solution and what you want in the end or as ideal may require different plan than facing imminent threat
2051,for the latter you can make alliance with people who otherwise wouldn’t be your friends
2052,i believe that democracy is the final cause of all the political problems i describe here but in the short run democracythe will of the people is on our side because the democracies have been hijacked by a stupid and corrupt elite
2053,the nations face extinction and an era of permanent civil war because this elite wants to pillage and pillage and wants to flood them with the shit of the world
2054,this is the immediate threat and on this you can be allied with people who otherwise may not shoot for the same star you do
2055,if ann coulter or pat buchanan were in charge you would get 99 of what you want
2056,therefore use them as models to solve the problems that face you and don’t scare the peoples with crazy talk if you want to move things politically
2057,let the normies have their normal lives and paint our enemies as the crazieswhich they are and as the corrupt vermin they are
2058,if you haven’t compromised yourself go into political life maybe and use trump as a model for success
2059,those of you who choose this path if you like this book or the other things i say should denounce it and disavow me if ever asked about it and denounce also all other crazy ideas
2060,you must have an instinct for how much normies are able to take
2061,it isn’t even a question of getting them to where you want “gradually”i don’t think they’re able to get very far at all
2062,but they can be moved to defend themselves from the grip of the global slave state which i also hate although for different reasons
2063,if an ethnostate is your ideal or if it’s renaissance switzerland or ancient egypt fine
2064,if you intend to go public and try something politically work now instead so that america and europe don’t become bosnia or south africa
2065,people who try to mislead you from such things and try to encourage you to talk in public instead about abstractions like “ethnostate” dork ideological constructs like “eurasianism” anachronistic slogans like “blood and soil” that never had any historical attraction to anglos and americansthese people are spergs or very often federal informants or manipulated by such
2066,by all means study such things believe in them troll with them let them guide your final aims but know what is possible in the normie political sphere and don’t become the clown of zog like nehlen and so many others did
2067,if they were serious people they would have never come in public and encouraged young men to go on marches where they could be identified and tracked for life
2068,know when the snake is defending itselfdon’t be a patsy
2069,your models must be those that have worked trump orban the italian movements now ascendant sebastian kurz and his party in austria
2070,you don’t see these people marching around in hotel bellboy’s uniforms with a sonnenrad and talking about the “jewish question” and this other kind of roleplay
2071,it’s true that in the end my aims here and those of someone like orban have little or nothing in common
2072,if they were successful all they would be able to do is reestablish the same world of sheep that existed a hundred years ago maybe inoculated against the latest degradationsbut nothing very great
2073,still i think it’s better for the nations to be welltended happy sheep than to be reduced to teeming piles of starving rats
2074,this anyway is my advice for those who want to go into normie politics and have a relatively normie life and there’s nothing wrong with thatit’s even a great necessity
2075,i’ve written this book however because this may not satisfy some of us and i wanted to talk about the world in the coming decades and what paths may open for a different way
2076,67 too much is already said about the evils of suburbs but i think the danger of such places for modern civilized man is so great that it must be repeated
2077,on the other hand it’s important not to take this too far the europeans live in the center of their cities and are politically and socially in just as bad or worse situations
2078,still i think it’s easier for them to fix their problems and to avert the greatest dangers should they arrive
2079,it’s easier because in these places the rightful citizens of the nations still own their cities
2080,i don’t see any evidence that the tax base of america moved to the suburbs by choice
2081,their inner cities were taken away from them not as is imagined by blacks but by the politiciansand their handlerswho found it more profitable to replace middle class citizens with an underclass
2082,the space to which they’ve been segregated and to which they have to “commute” is i think a form of absolute hell to raise children in especially boys
2083,there is no freedom of motion except to regimented activities they are always watched by caretakers of some kind
2084,the places are of incredible ugliness which takes away also from the will to discover new things at all
2085,there are no nooks and corners where boys can form gangs be away from prying eyes of parents and others and have the feeling that they are exploring and owning territory as there is in the city and in the countryside
2086,america has successfully portioned off its historical population its rightful citizens and its tax base in work camps and dormitories
2087,that is what the modern american “city” is an economic zone arranged much like a workcamp or concentration camp if you want
2088,it would be trivial for the french security services to shut off access to the banlieues infested by turds and it would be just as trivial for american security services to shut off access to the suburbs and hold the middle class by the neck
2089,i think the reason the suburbs are hateful to the raising of boys is also the reason they are most objectionable in general namely that while in the countryside or the city a restive population would be able to hold their territory and challenge a power should the need arise such a thing is impossible in the suburbs
2090,suburbs are living arrangement for slaves and subjects
2091,68 “social justice”disgusting parasitism dressed up in rags of words so worn out and peestained even their defenders are sick of the smellthey say it half mouthed and pleading just look at them during the occupy rallies hoping to siphon off respect
2092,the need to be respected is sign of very low and wormlike condition of spirit
2093,the tantrums of the coddled and domesticated of no force no force behind it just the opinions of the leftover the prattling of guilt and begging not even the marxist engine of the worker
2094,what worker
2095,they have contempt for the workerthe force and confidence in his labor in the place of his labor in history that the bolshevik had is gone now it’s the lumpen using his language unconvincingly
2096,dependent on the leviathan and therefore its tool
2097,“social” justicebut why only “social”why set your sights so lowyou mean just the opinions of the many
2098,who cares
2099,here is my vision of the true justice the justice of nature the zoos opened predators unleashed by the dozens hundredsfour thousand hungry wolves rampaging on streets of these hive cities elephants and bison stampeding the buildings smashed to pieces the cries of the human bug shearing through the streets as the lord of beasts returns
2100,manhattan moscow peking reduced to ruins overgrown by vines and forest the haunt of the lynx and coyote again
2101,the great cesspool slums calcutta nairobi all the fetid latrines of the world covered over by mudslides overgrown with thick jungle this is justice
2102,lisbon to me always seemed city still inhabited just out of vanity
2103,let loose hundreds of tigers companies of rhinoceros with strong engine of spirit revving in their deep chests let them bring the justice of the volcano to this world of trash
2104,bless the passing of the shoggoth
2105,69 there is story from heian period in japanese history that i always found amazing
2106,japan was still ruled by the imperial court and there were local administrators and so on like any oriental centralized despotism
2107,but there was also warrior class
2108,they inherited this from some steppe invasions that changed their society a few centuries before
2109,anyway as always happens the imperial bureaucrats grew useless and weak and by the end of this age all the actual physical power was with the samurai
2110,what i find amazing is how long it took them to figure out they no longer had to listen to the weak commands of the imperial hierarchy and that they were actually the rulers
2111,words like “legitimacy” “soft power” “rights” or in their time honor duty divine right and so on are all delusions meant to distract and obscure men of power from their own strength and aims and put them in service to someone else
2112,such men are more likely than others to be driven by notions of honor and responsibility
2113,and this sense is therefore very easy to abuseand such men can be manipulated for some time
2114,eventually they do realize however that they don’t have to listen and that they are actually the ones who rule
2115,this moment when “the game is up” the moment of revelation is what i’ve always found very amazing
2116,in the modern world everything moves much fasteri expect that not long from now such men will awaken in the west and i suppose other parts of the world and wonder why for so long they had listened to complete cretins give ordersand give orders too with such weak pretexts much weaker than the bureaucracy of imperial japan
2117,in fiji the natives became relatively recently outnumbered because a hundred years before the english imported their favorite cheap labor the tamils
2118,eventually these outbred the natives and became the majority
2119,so under democracy rules they took over the state
2120,the natives however still controlled the military
2121,they saw no reason why they must follow this “democracy” into giving their lands away to aliens brought in by oppressors
2122,so they took over the state and did so very easily
2123,i think it’s inevitable that this will become the rule all over the world and very soon
2124,democracy and ethnic diversity don’t mix but the ethnic nationalists are wrong when they think that the result of all this will be secession
2125,lowgrade ethnic warfare is a terrible thing but to break up entire nations into smaller pieces as much as the city state is to my taste isn’t likely to happen
2126,you must look to south africa where the whites and coloreds could have asked for their own state in cape town and agitated for this but instead they wanted to keep the country together
2127,the reason for this is that any such secession would have meant giving up all parts of the country rich in gold diamonds and many other things
2128,south africa is an extreme case and secession where a minority is five or ten percent of the populationhere it might happen
2129,but it’s a net loss to have the boers migrate out of the land their ancestors tamed and built and it would be a net loss in america if it had to happen what some of you want to cede the southwest to mexico or whatever other schemes are discussed
2130,if indeed you do manage to get a white population that is as mobilized and selfaware as you want they won’t feel it a great victory to give up land and resources their ancestors won by their valor
2131,the greatest president was polk
2132,but what’s likely to happen long before any mobilization by white populations in their home countries is military rule democracy will go before pure ethnostates are formed
2133,i think this happened many times in history in ages of national decline not just because of ethnic or religious diversity but for many other reasons and most of all because the military form of government is natural to human species
2134,those generals will be most successful who mix power with personal flair like duterte or peron did
2135,this is very difficult in america because of the types of men who get promoted in the military
2136,some will be able to affect however the charisma of roman stern old man
2137,70 given the inevitability of military government i see already how nationalists and many similar men sympathetic to the cause of freedom and high life will join the armed forces and rise through the ranks and my guess is that many are already doing this
2138,in some way this had already happened and at the middle ranks the armed forces are still relatively full of patriots throughout the western world
2139,in france the military and security services including the crs support the national front of le pen overwhelmingly
2140,it’s only a matter of time
2141,in the anglo world it’s somewhat more complicated
2142,the upper ranks have long been purged of men who could offer resistance to the hidden hands that rule it started with the tailhook “scandal” and even before then and only accelerated after
2143,even at the level of captain or major many men are traditional conservatives and not exactly nationalists
2144,i think it’s unnecessary to address such men directly events alone will convince them
2145,but many are being persecuted as it is and run out of the military in the same way that police departments are being purged
2146,this process is very slow
2147,it won’t work out well in the end for the lords of lies all the technology in the world won’t save a “diverse” military if it should ever be in a conflict they’ll turn the missiles on themselves by accident or run submarines into the ocean floor as has already happened in south africa
2148,still america is pretty well isolated from danger and you fool yourself if you think they will “reform” anything even if they suffer disastrous defeats abroad
2149,they fear men of power within the country more than they do any foreign army
2150,it’s difficult to solve this problem
2151,the military is already so full of homofaggotry that it will be very unpleasant for any man who is a man to join its ranks at the moment
2152,he might have a hard time advancing in its hierarchy even affecting the views of a traditional religious conservative or a mainstream trumpist which is i suppose as far as you could go right now
2153,i would hate also to see any free man killed or maimed in the service of this military that’s been turned into a hessian merc force for gulf nabobs for various ethnic groups for the idiotic schemes of international financiers and the benefit of machine politicians looking to advance their families’ fortunes abroad
2154,then there is also the extreme boredom you should expect from any kind of military life which even under the best circumstances consists in busywork
2155,that said military training is very valuable
2156,even in a situationprecisely in the case where men of any worth will have a tough time becoming generals and suchthen it will be even more valuable
2157,military training and the brotherhood with other men in battle that comes from it is a lifelong advantage and a great benefit to any cause
2158,i can’t give advice to anyone for how to live but those who would be willing to deal with the evils of the modern military and are aware of all the drawbacks but still find themselves suited for it would do a great good for themselves and for their peoples if they joined
2159,it goes without saying that they will have to practice good judgment and discretion while in service but the military can’t simply be abandoned to mohawked latinx traps and neoleninist activists
2160,nationalists i have no doubt will join and attempt to reform both the ranks and the academies in the western world
2161,then there are also things like the french foreign legion although the discipline they practice is terrible
2162,it lasts seven years and they reserve the right to pursue you in any country if you desert
2163,many exss men and other germans from world war ii joined the legion and fought in vietnam and some committed suicide because of the rigors of this unit
2164,although it’s possible now that they’ve relaxed somewhat
2165,71 everything that is said now about russia is pure projection
2166,in fact it’s america and the western world that is run by spooks and intel agencies
2167,they’ve placed their assets and compromised patsies in the corporate world no less than in other government agencies and among elected politicians
2168,many like obama for example are entirely creations of this or that faction inside the security system
2169,these in turn are allied to oligarchs and often to foreign interests and powers so that it’s hard to think many western nations have anything but a parody of freedom and national sovereignty
2170,“representative democracy” plus a bureaucratic state is often criticized by conservatives as destructive of personal freedom and initiative which it is but given that most people who go into public life are poor and weakminded it also just means indirect rule by spooks oligarchs and whatever foreign nation or interest can funnel more money or influence or threat here or there
2171,many of these people in the west screaming about russia are puppets of china or the gulf stateseven when they’re not directly on the take or compromised they expect sinecures and great wealth that will come in the future
2172,most of the media is similarly compromised although the average schmuck journalist is probably deluded by the platitudes of “free press” and the humanitarian doxies that have been banged in their heads
2173,inside head they have central vacuole full of fluid no brain
2174,i have no doubt that things like “pizzagate” are real simply because if i was a spook or a rich man with spooks available i’d find it very easy to compromise the officious statushungry low people who have been attracted to government in our time
2175,these people arrive in the capital cities with a hungry look in the eye and being full of the feeling that “they’re in on things” and that they’ve made it have a very tough time controlling their appetites or behavior
2176,many are chosen and groomed precisely because they begin with demented appetites to begin with
2177,this isn’t to say there aren’t patriotic factions within the security services that actually run the west or patriotic oligarchs who can’t offshore their wealth and whose interest is in some sense then tied to the land and the people
2178,i foresee a time anyway when nationalists those who are capable of it will begin to join these services
2179,they will do themselves their friends and their country a great good through this
2180,some who are suited to math and technology will no doubt join those types of agencies
2181,others are already learning foreign languagestibetan has many uses
2182,but there are other languages and area studies for those who go to college to study and do well in
2183,arabic russian persian chinese indonesian many opportunities
2184,given the very low talent pool in government or available for recruitment they will be able to join those other types of agencies of which there are a few with some ease
2185,here it would be necessary more than in the military to hide one’s power level and even to affect the left internationalist doxy at times
2186,any nationalist or populist would be wise to affect at most the style of a mueller should he want to be “on the right” not all are capable of this and i think the strain will be considerable
2187,such people will often have to work alone and remain quite isolated for years holding their aim and star as a precious hidden possession and never confuse the shortterm for the final goal
2188,few will be able to or want to deal with the nonsensethis has been the problem of the anglo conservatives all along though
2189,they’ve always preferred to get a tan play tennis and make money
2190,they’ve wanted to be left alone so that the state was taken over by vermin
2191,i expect such things will change regardless of what i or anyone else says simply because some people want to survive and not to die out
2192,they will no doubt slowly one way or another join and change the face of such agencies
2193,the power of the modern world remains for the foreseeable future in such agencies
2194,a fateful comet like a caesar and napoleon is a hard thing to hope for
2195,and such a man would need allies anyway
2196,72 government work can be too boring for men of adventure
2197,some say that the cia for example exaggerates its incompetence in movies or in known events the failure of 911 of iraq their endless humiliations at the hands of the sovietsto hide its true power and appear weaker than it is
2198,but i think this isn’t true and if you’ve met excia people you’ll understand that the rumors about their disability aren’t exaggerated at all
2199,after james jesus angleton they were thoroughly fucked in every hole by the soviets and others
2200,all his warnings came true
2201,he was a unique american of rare secretive character in a people that enjoys openness and display for this he is now maligned in meanspirited movies
2202,he wasn’t very typical of his people the anglosaxon and i suppose it’s possible that through his spanish blood there came a strain of habsburg court intrigue or something like this
2203,the russians and others are very good at intelligence work because they grow up in a world of secrecy and learn to take great joy in subterfuge of this kind
2204,most americans who try this are just playing games and affecting a manner
2205,full of mormons and various cripplettes who put on a high wasp manner full also of soccer moms and neuters the intelligence services are in fact quite incompetent despite their considerable power
2206,both can be true
2207,and you can see this in their very clumsy attempts to affect public opinion inside america
2208,i won’t talk about speculation over false flag attacks and such which i’m sure happen
2209,but it’s without a doubt that they’ve tried to get into the “meme” business and had units dedicated to this kind of visual propaganda especially during the last election
2210,we all saw their efforts and we laughed
2211,i think the biggest threat the right presented to this system came from something like 4chan which showed it can be an intelligence agency of its own and far superior to what the formal spooks could do
2212,how they located obscure objects places and people from photos is something that formallytrained agents couldn’t normally do
2213,the memes put a spike of fear in the hearts of all the constipated spooks
2214,a couple of images spread by ricky vaughn or some channers made the news and were many times more effective than the government’s own propaganda efforts and you can see in shows like homeland and others the really titanic hatred these people had for the army of rightwing autists that messed up their plans
2215,they work hard to dox for this reason
2216,you must understand where your strengths lie
2217,if government or military work isn’t appropriate learn this art of the visual communication and share it with your friends work with each other to perfect it
2218,don’t be lame
2219,learn to make videos and photosthere are various tools around many editing programs
2220,you can start with cheap camera if you need
2221,work in groupsin “labs” to develop perfect and target these videos and images
2222,i assure you this frightens them and is many many times more effective than marching in public and playing the clown they want you to play
2223,the long game of persuading the public is far from won
2224,keep the eye on the task far from accomplished to discredit authorities to mock all public pieties to show the leaders of government bureaucracy finance corporations big tech and media for the pathetic ghouls they are
2225,many gains have been made lately but their dishonor in the eyes of the normies is far from accomplished
2226,when they try to make you expose yourself and to make positive claims they win
2227,keep up the pressure of true samizdat
2228,73 some people like to meet and display in public and i think this can be done if done well
2229,but there are very few groups that do this well
2230,they exist all over the worlda couple in america and europe some in south america and in japan
2231,the few nationalist organizations that do it well have much care for appearance and also don’t engage in ideologies symbols and behaviors that are bizarre or hostile to the customs and wishes of the people
2232,a japanese nationalist can invoke shinto imagery and oppose this nationalist mode to the “foreign” religion of buddhism but that’s because these two traditions have been in a pushpull game throughout the history of that country and still are
2233,but no independent pagan tradition exists in the western world and playacting in that way is going to fail
2234,offending christians in political movements is stupid when they’re one of the last bastions against a common enemy
2235,if their beliefs are corrupted they can be reformed
2236,above all i believe that any public movement will be most effective if it is not political at all and remains “implicit” i think there can be much good done in public but should be promoted in the form of a social movement not a political one
2237,nationalists must present a healthy alternative to the eternal rule of ugliness in our time promote nature beauty physical fitness the preservation of high traditions of literature and art
2238,in regards to the latter it’s even a necessity because there’s no school or university that will give you a worthwhile education
2239,there are a variety of ways to approach this but i think given the collapse of the boy scouts that a scouting and naturepreservation movement would be one of the best
2240,hiking and the protection preservation and admiration of public and national parks would put youth in the wilderness and inspire a sense of boundlessness and awe in them
2241,it would teach them many skills build camaraderie and emphasize the connection between the people and the land both for the participants and as a matter of image for others
2242,it’s without a doubt that any public organization will be infiltrated by feds hostiles and agents provocateurs and therefore it’s necessary to avoid and condemn any imagery or message of violence and to ostracize people who exhibit tendencies in that direction or who try to convince others to idiotic “action” one can do this at the same time that such groups can engage in selfdefense martial arts training and indeed in an urban setting work for the creation of private boxing and wrestling clubs
2243,the risks are considerable either way but it’s not out of the question that through the path of the promotion of health and beauty you will be able even to persuade feds to your side they too can selfimprove
2244,this would be a movement of peace
2245,the right can at the moment furthermore easily take over the doctrine of peaceof nonintervention abroadand of the protection of nature and these things would be great achievementsthis would go some way to convincing youth to your side
2246,i would also recommend that you don’t engage in outright racism of a useless sort for example the deliberate exclusion of friendlies from different races and so on they would in any case be very few
2247,this can happen at the same time that you openly appeal to white youths and defend them from racial attacks and teach them the greatness of their history and their literary traditions
2248,women on the other hand must be absolutely excluded from such groups and rather encouraged to have their own
2249,the presence of women in any group like this will totally destroy its social function by introducing sexual competition and by the fact that it’s in their blood to play on men’s misplaced chivalry to cause friction for their own advantage
2250,such a movement would be a living rebuke to the constrained and low anxious life promoted by the regime of the crippled
2251,once developed and with some reach but maybe even in the beginning they can engage in local welfare projects of various kinds for example helping opiate addicts by providing them with gyms and by breathing into them the desire for life helping old people who are alone keeping the streets and parks clean and many other such things
2252,i also think that claiming public spaces in cities should eventually be tried in the same way that members of generation identity in europe often patrol the subways and streets to show they won’t be intimidated
2253,but for this to happen there must be goodwill built first for the public
2254,there will of course be many attacks made on such groups but what matters is whether the majority will believe them
2255,if you remain firm as a social movement of peace of the promotion of natural beauty healthy living and healthy nationalism any attacks on such groups can be made to appear for what they are the fears of the paranoids and hatreds of the resentful and ugly
2256,74 the equivalent of the “meme” in political action is the prank
2257,you really can’t underestimate the power of a good prankthis can be as little as putting up a funny banner or a witty slogan
2258,such things don’t need to be connected to any formal group but done in private by yourself or with your friends
2259,the pit bull ban campaign is a great example of reallife trolling
2260,the “it’s ok to be white” stickers were a good idea at least in the beginning those who began to put threatening fonts on them or logos for weirdo organizations ruined that troll very fast
2261,the purpose of all such “political action” should be the same as memetic samizdat which is to make the enemy look ridiculous
2262,you must show them for what they are which is dour old sclerotic ugly pedantic it’s good if you show yourself in the opposite light although not necessary
2263,but in france the hommen a traditionalist and manly response to the femmen have provided a good model for attractive public action of this sort
2264,they use masks and anonymity is often an absolute necessity for this kind of thing
2265,but the possibilities of this are boundless and even in cases like the “ok to be white” stickers where the initial message isn’t funny it works because it forces the enemy to take a public position that is widely and justly recognized as evil and resentful
2266,trump has been very good at this although it’s not hard he frequently forces his opponents to take the side of the vilest murderers gang members of lawlessness and decrepit viciousness
2267,all such actions must be performed unannounced planned in secret and carried out with a close group of friends to prevent the enemy from organizing a preemptive action
2268,remember that they still own many of the cities and the police forces in these cities which can be induced to act illegally and to put you in danger for this reason and many others public rallies announced well ahead of time are totally useless as are public “policy” speeches and other such wankery
2269,you must of course avoid all violence and all talk of violence as well and not fall into the trap they want you to fall into
2270,in a small group of friends you know yourself it’s easier to police who stays and who doesn’t and easier to use your judgment about whether this or that guy is nuts or worse
2271,remember always to keep eyes on the prize in such action which is to discredit the enemy and expose his authoritarianism his stupidity his slavishness his corruption
2272,75 the friends you make are more important far more important than the girlfriends or wives you’ll have
2273,and actually your girl will admire you for this not that you should do it for that reason but it’s an added benefit women admire men with great personal projects and who are not beholden to them
2274,if she’s your “everything” and your “best friend” she will likely lose respect for you
2275,the greatest “in” that nationalists and allies have against the enemy is the fact that the enemy has sowed sexual chaos and has destroyed romance
2276,our parents’ generations are largely responsible for this but the lords of lies and ugliness who rule our time continue it and use it as their greatest tool of control
2277,so this is the best way to awaken men to the evil and subjection of our time and i would say also many women who are very unsatisfied
2278,on the other hand someone who is motivated simply by this problem isn’t reliable
2279,there won’t be any “beta revolution” and betas are unreliable because they can be easily bought off with a girlfriend or even a shrew wife and the parody of a good domestic life
2280,i’ve seen many men intelligent and welleducated but weak in their core and much too concerned with women who gave up all higher aspirations once a halfdecent girl came along
2281,i find it disturbing that so many think this kind of life is a great salvation for you personally or “for your race” this is ridiculous
2282,by all means marry and have children if you want but don’t do it as a political statement or a form of action
2283,quite aside from the fact that you yourself wouldn’t have wanted to be born as part of a demographic war this isn’t a kind of struggle that civilized races with a need for space and fresh air can ever win
2284,the idea that whites or japanese should start vomiting out six or seven children to a vagina like the illiterate slave hordes of bangladesh or niger is absurd
2285,for one it’s never going to happenand it shouldn’t
2286,throughout history we’ve almost always been outnumbered and it hasn’t been a problem
2287,immigration restriction combined with some judicious deportation done gradually would be enough to secure the homelands of the civilized
2288,if the situation worsens or a time of crisis comes the eventual abandonment of democracy and other far sterner measures including i expect the intervention of the military will take place
2289,autists having a family or not doesn’t matter in a world of billions the european nations have populations of hundreds of millions and aren’t in danger of “dying out” so by all means have a girlfriend and a family but i fear that too much focus on this as a “statement” against the program of the enemy is a mistake
2290,usually a family is the end of a man
2291,this can be both good and bad
2292,but the necessities of caring for a family and the emotional demands usually blind him to anything higher
2293,in case you do have a family have it because you have great love and lust for a womanand i would recommend the same for women abandonment to such instinct if you are lucky enough to have it
2294,choose by quality of biology and remember that the intellect is inherited from the mother the character from the father
2295,but once you have a family don’t think this is a “political” achievement or that it would ever be enough
2296,continue the mission you have set out for yourself and continue above all the friendships you have formed in service to this higher cause
2297,the friendships you have made meeting each other in person or online are the greatest event of the last few years and source for the greatest promise
2298,you must never stop studying and working together or forget the enthusiasm of this discovery
2299,a friendship in struggle for war and a higher cause is something that more than anything else can lift you out of the dreadful gravity of this turgid world of shades
2300,76 caring too much about food nutrition and especially health can be considered something unmanlya kind of neurotic hypochondriac fretting more suited to spinsters
2301,on the other hand in the past the world was not as full of poison as it is now
2302,nearly all the food is centrally produced stored in warehouses and poisoned with mycotoxins and many other things that slowly destroy your essence
2303,therefore it’s important to take measures to protect yourself against this as far as you can
2304,although it’s expensive the probiotic gastrus has been of great use to many of us
2305,something else i can recommend is coconut oil and staying in the sun
2306,if you are not a bogjig whose ancestors evolved under permanent cloud cover in northwest europe you will usually be able to tan and the effects of sun are many and very good
2307,you have no excuse
2308,those who can’t tan must supplement with vitamin d3 but also some other things
2309,you begin with ten minutes in midday sun and work up from there
2310,usually thirty minutes a day is enough when you can get there
2311,there’s much propaganda about tanning but once you live in tropical areas you can see that even brown people begin to look sickly and have a kind of sallow color if they avoid the sun
2312,you’re meant to worship the sun
2313,remember the song of new order
2314,it goes without saying that you must lift weights and for this there are many different programs all suited to a different body different biology and different aims
2315,in general it’s better to lose fat and cut body fat before growing in muscle but it depends on many things
2316,but a regime of sun and steel is absolutely required for your mood your aesthetics for getting the attention of women and the respect of men and above all for preparation for struggle and war
2317,in ancient greek cities only the citizens were allowed to lift weights and work in the gym slaves were forbidden
2318,it’s no wonder that the robots of babylon seek to ban gyms for men in our time
2319,the pathetic failure of the “swoleleft” an entirely artificial construct promoted in a preplanned and coordinated way by formal organs of the left all of this is very instructive the occasional exception aside it’s not possible to be “swoleleft” today
2320,any man who improves his body through sun and steel will drift away from the modern left a program of decrepitude and resentful monstrosity
2321,they know this and are afraid
2322,i have to make this restatement now at the end of this brief manifesto many are domestic animals and happy that way
2323,i speak instead to the men who feel stifled by this bug world
2324,people at all times try to domesticate each other
2325,language is used to clobber and deceive others into submission and domestication
2326,ideas and arguments and stories are manufactured for the same
2327,the modern world is no different in this regard from any wretched tribal society
2328,im sure that europe prior to the bronze age before the coming of the aryans was similar to modern europe
2329,people lived in communal longhouses and were likely browbeaten and ruled by obese mammies who instilled in them socialism and feminism
2330,most of those socalled males of the longhouse age were probably similar to the modern leftist herb who doesnt lift
2331,which is why those societies were so easily conquered
2332,the left realizes they look weak and lamebecause they are
2333,they know they have nothing to offer youth but submission and lectures
2334,they know theyre unsexy and staid
2335,if indeed young leftist men will start lifting and worshiping beauty they will be forced to leave the left
2336,the bugman pretends to be motivated by compassion but is instead motivated by a titanic hatred of the wellturnedout and beautiful
2337,the bugman seeks to bury beauty under a morass of ubiquitous ugliness and garbage
2338,so much of the pacific and the pristine oceans are now full of garbage and plastic
2339,this garbage is flowing out of cities built on piles of unimaginable filth
2340,the waters are polluted with birth control pills and mindbending drugs emitted by obese highfructosecornsyrupguzzling beasts
2341,then of course there is the ugliness of the people
2342,and its only getting uglier with the crowded unhygienic new cities of our age populated by hordes of dwarflike zombies that are imported for slave labor and political agitation from the flyswept latrines of the world
2343,people feel they cant escape this they know this is an aggressive method to demoralize and oppress
2344,when i post my images of vitality in the clear sun of a long noon they feel a weight lifted off them
2345,many feel as if theyve escaped the gravity of this trash world and returned to a time when the natural beauty of man could be displayed indicating this is a form of life free to develop its powers
2346,i believe in the right of nature
2347,im bored by ideology and by wordchopping
2348,the images i post speak for themselves and point to a primal order that is felt by all in a physical sense
2349,when i or my followers post powerful beautiful images of male models of unbelievable vitality and youth our enemies gnash their teeth in envy and hatred while we are exalted and inspired
2350,the superior like the handsome alexander exert an almost magical effect that draws others to them
2351,some are drawn to higher action others to other tasks but all petty cares are forgotten
2352,there is nothing that needs to be said or elaborated no need to intellectualize this any more than the natural attraction wolves on the move have for their king or bees in a hive for their queen
2353,when i post images of godlike men like pietro boselli many are in awe and drawn to emulate
2354,i have inspired many to develop their bodies and physical and spiritual power
2355,i have nothing to say to the frivolous people who have found themselves maybe bewildered in positions of influence in media or government or to the many superfluous who follow them
2356,in the next hundred years and even before barbaric piratical brotherhoods will wipe away this corrupt civilization as they did at the end of the bronze age
2357,77 the star of the covenant  what is likely then to happen in the long run
2358,i foresee a time not too far in the future when the leviathan will not be able to hold itself together
2359,i expect that the peoples will be able to save themselves from the global slave project that is now promoted
2360,but what will come after is likely to be unsatisfying as well
2361,the nations will escape the danger but they will return to their peaceful and sheeplike existence
2362,they will need to be protected from getting themselves into the same position as they are now
2363,i believe that at some point before or after the troubles the superior specimens are going to find each other and leave this civilization
2364,they will form fortresses on the edge of the civilized world in the tropics from where they will watch the seas
2365,the era of high piracy will return
2366,such men will develop above all their physical powers and their ability to wage war
2367,they will offer the nations defense in exchange for a price
2368,occasionally they will send a great demagogue into the peoples when this becomes necessary
2369,such men perched atop these eagles’ nests will have the territory of a new frontier again and a life that suits them
2370,science will be liberated from the constraints of caring for comfort or entertainment
2371,great projects in science the projects of private men will once again begin
2372,such fortresses will possess frightful weapons to defend themselves and will have penetrated deep into the nations their antennae and their many emissaries and watchers
2373,i think that is a great dream but it may happen sooner than you think
2374,with a few details off it’s what executive outcomes would have become or bob denard would have become if the great states of europe had been unable to stop them
2375,and i think soon they will be unable
2376,but this great opportunity is still some time away
2377,before then there must be a great work done
2378,i see a time soon when a few men maybe no more than a few hundred in the whole nation or spread out over the whole world will embark on the mission of the great down going
2379,i have praised instinct many times in this book
2380,but life on the ascent can follow instinct whereas if you feel yourself to be a decadent it’s very important to resist instincts that lead to pointless selfdestruction
2381,discipline and excellence are best when they come from your own desires not from repression
2382,but if your instincts lead you instead to selfdebasing behaviors that will hurt you by all means resist
2383,just understand that this path is at most a makeshift
2384,we should want to give birth to beings who follow the higher path in life as a matter of innate blood and desire not out of duty
2385,having to spend time and spiritual energy trying to repress destructive desires is difficult and expensive
2386,discipline is most important but it matters where it comes from
2387,unfortunately many pay no attention at all to these two ways of “discipline” but instead are concerned only with the public image of their virtue or goodness
2388,there’s next to no good in that
2389,and the right has hurt itself considerably by the adoption of this kind of phariseeism
2390,i give you an example of what i mean many of the intelligence agencies are populated with mormons
2391,these men are chosen for their upright moral character the fact that they pass lie detector tests that they’re not easily compromised and so onall qualities that make for bad spies
2392,to be effective in this world you must be very wellacquainted with the underworld with criminal life with junkies dealers prostitutes gamblers with the perviest of pervs
2393,and this is what i mean by the great downgoing
2394,to gain a true hold on the foundations of this trashworld a certain group among the right will have to descend in this inferno
2395,i am firmly convinced that this is the key to overturning everything that is corrupt and the path to the great purgation
2396,i imagine a network of brothels and gamblinghouses around the world production of porn videos and a complete penetration of the world of vice
2397,yes to ensnare to compromise to corrupt and above all to observe and to know their secrets
2398,to descend into a floating world of complete vice and even to engage in itas you must if you are to thrive in this worldwhile keeping your head and keeping in focus the fire of your aimisn’t this a great and very difficult achievement
2399,this path must be only for very few very few are suited to it
2400,but these few are to be among the greatest of the coming generation
2401,this brotherhood will work instead to intensify vice to stir up demonic passions to sow total confusion in the heart of the beast
2402,the increase of chaos confusion and pressure on the leviathan will lay it low imagine even a world where the people under relentless assault of contradictory and wild claims would lose all faith in the media and government and doctors and believe nothing they hear through official channels anymore
2403,this would be an order of knights of the spirit such as exists at most every thousand years
2404,slowly maybe over two generations they will work patiently exploring and laying claims to all the sewers of the underworld all the effluences of the leviathan all the joints of the lower skeleton that undergirds this world
2405,they will take over night clubs bars brothels hotels casinos pornography and much worse and rather than live to insulate themselves from the vice promoted by this world they will intensify it and learn to wield it as a great weapon
2406,it is the greatest weapon in our age
2407,know that the leviathan sustains itself not by the promotion of vice but by its normalization
2408,but in every normalization a great deal must be edited out this is its great weakness
2409,this order of knights will keep vice true to itself
2410,from underneath comes all the satanic power of the babylon we are fighting
2411,some men whose bond between each other must be made of titanium will surely come around who can descend in that worldwho have the mental and spiritual resources to descend to the underworld and come back with the prize
2412,i am sure this covenant this brotherhood of the damned when they are first taking steps to descend will feel like the great mystery of things will reveal itself in its fullness to themnot the answer ungraspable by the mind but just this x the madness inherent behind things will show itself as they are about to descend it will be an amazing rush like when great pterodactyl cryptid bird of prey in congo is about to swoop down in the night on its target from canopy
2413,i know such men of bronze existi dream that as they descend they will keep their eyes above on the great north star and i think about how they will feeli imagine how they will traverse the great labyrinth of shadows while their spirit fixes itself with a great focus and obsession on that fateful star and that other onethe destroyer of nations never forgetting the way backnot forgetting its call and the eternal task it whispers into those with ears to listen
