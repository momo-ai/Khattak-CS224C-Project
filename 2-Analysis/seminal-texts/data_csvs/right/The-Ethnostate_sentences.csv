3,twenty years ago he still believed it possible that his moribund country could revive clean out its political and cultural augean stables and establish a pax americana that would herald a new age of peace plenty and progress
4,now that more than two decades have passed events are proving that america as we have known it is beyond saving
5,the majority that is the northern and western european elements of the population has lost whatever chance it had to recapture the country it ruled for more than two centuries
6,defeatist as lit may sound this does not mean it is too late to save the majority as a people
7,this could be effected by breaking up the united states into small independent regions established in the areas where most of americas various population groups are concentrated and gathered
8,the same process of fragmentation and regrouping might save the peoples of western europe who are also in a period of steep social and cultural decline though by no means to the same extent as the american majority
9,what is called for is a new form of goverment that would transform socially destructive into socially constructive forces
10,race now actively tearing countries apart might be helpful in putting them back together but this time in the form of autonomous relatively selfsufficient collectivities that the author has chosen to designate as ethnostates
11,since nothing else seems to be working since every new day brings with it ix x the ethnostate new demographic horrors a little rethinking of the funda­ mental themes and axioms of modem statecraft might be in order
12,although the author is an american he will not confine his remarks to what used to be his country but will aim many of them overseas
13,inescapably however his emphasis will be on the united states not only because of his birth and up­ bringing but also because what is happening in the western world in these parlous times is happening first in america
14,to employ spenglers term but without accepting his organic view of history the decline of the west is accel­ erating faster in the united states than elsewhere
15,consequent­ ly the suggestions advanced in this book for halting and reversing this decline should have the highest priority for euroamericans the most threatened of all white population groups south african whites excepted
16,europeans and their racial cousins in canada australia and new zealand have more time and may get out of their rut with less effort though the chances that their social order will survive the battering of minority racism and decadent liberalism in the long term are not significantly better
17,introduction we have all heard more than enough of world revolution in the 20th century
18,mass graves are filled with people who were executed with revolutionary and counterrevolutionary phrases ringing in their ears
19,it is now abundantly clear that instead of putting mankind on the right track to a successful social order the compass of revolution particularly revolutionary marxism has steered millions tens of millions and hundreds of millions onto the reefs of economic sterility political breakdown and social disease
20,it is indicative of the deep slough of mental confusion in which we are mired that darwinism the most plausible theory to explain the origin and development of life forms is still be­ lieved when believed at all as a sort of evil truth while marxism which in both theory and practice has proved to be irreparably flawed is despite the recent events in the soviet union still looked upon favorably by large segments of the worlds intelligentsia
21,if darwin is right or closest to being right is it not time to organize mankind according to his rules of organic develop­ ment and close our ears to the a priori fulminations of class warriors
22,by darwinism of course is not meant social dar­ winism a hobbesian scenario of people fighting tooth and claw for survival in a solipsistic frenzy of produce and con­ sume
23,to darwin survival of the fittest herbert spencers term meant simply that life forms which adapted most skill­ fully to their environments had the best chances of producing 1 2 the ethnostate an enduring line of progeny
24,neodarwinians take advantage of mendelian genetics to propose that the beneficial mutations which increase an organisms opportunities of survival will in some cases result in the creation of a new and occasionally higher species
25,since this process works most effectively in isolated groups it is only reasonable to suppose that it would operate more successfully for men and women living in small homogeneous states than in vast multiracial political imper­ iums where beneficial mutations especially if they occurred in recessive genes would be swamped before they could take hold in a large population mix
26,it is not too difficult to play tricks with hegelian dialectics
27,marx proposed that feudalism thesis passed into capitalism antithesis only to be resolved by communism synthesis
28,why not monoracial feudal fiefdoms thesis evolving into huge multiracial political agglomerations antithesis eventu­ ally to be resolved by ethnostates synthesis
29,wordplay aside the ethnostate can be defined as the political entity best suited to accelerate human evolution
30,the ultimate goal of most forms of socialism is one world one society one racea political end times that flies in the face of the biological process which produced man the great­ est of all biological marvels
31,the evolution of all living things has been generated by variety by genetic branching by the synergistic mechanics of speciation in which different phyla genera and races branch out in all directions some to extinc­ tion somemuch less frequentlyto a higher evolutionary grade
32,what is more drab than a continentsized garden con­ taining only one kind of flower
33,what would be more eye­ catching than a landscape dotted with innumerable small gar­ dens each with its own array of distinct blooms each tilled and fertilized in such a way as to bring out the fullest fragrance color and beauty of its floral riches
34,the everpresent urge to worldwide conformity would seem to augur a winding down of evolution
35,a faint death rattle can already be heard in the ecumenical squawks of western politi­ cians and liberal churchmen and in the earpiercing cacoph­ ony of most modem music both popular and serious
36,the ethnostate 3 if all civilization is not threatened at least certain civilized peoples are
37,the most threatened are the whites whose low birthrates can be mathematically represented by a curve con­ verging almost to zero
38,endangered species ethnic suicide and genocide are not unduly exaggerated terms for what is hap­ pening to the same race which only a few short centuries ago was dispatching its large population surplus to the ends of the earth
39,the antidote to the present crisis to the ever echoing sirenic call of one world is not counterrevolution
40,it is something even more extreme
41,it is devolution which is not a reversal of revolution
42,devolution proceeds from the big to the small from the roof to the foundation from erratic electrons to the stable nucleus
43,world revolution is an explosion
44,world devo­ lution is an implosion a contraction a recoiling from a unitary to a diversified world from topheavy ungainly empires and artificially contrived states to more manageable core states where society rests on the hard rock of genes and culture in­ stead of the quicksands of proletarian myths egalitarian fan­ tasies and retouched history
45,to put it in crass political terms devolution is the surrender or delegation of powers formerly held by a central government to regional or provincial author­ ities
46, the earth abounds with population groups whose distinct characteristics set them apart
47,some fit the description of races others are better described as subraces or ethnic groups
48,although it is the intellectual fashion these days to deny or downplay serious and significant human variations particu­ larly variations in intelligence and character population groups do possess a matrix of visible and invisible dif­ ferencesdifferent physical and mental traits different art styles as well as different gods
49, many words with the de and dis prefix will appear throughout this study decomposition degeneration deteriorate disintegrate dis­ establish displace
50,the one that will appear most oftendevolution­ is the word that is likely to be the most misunderstood
51,the principal dictionary definition of devolution is quite plain the transference as of rights powers or responsibility to another esp the surrender of powers to local authorities by a central government
52,4 the ethnostate the ethnostate is designed to accommodate and profit from group differences by giving mother nature her head and en­ listing darwinism in the service of political science
53,who can say that evolutionary theory is not as qualified as other non­ political theories to intrude into world politics
54,darwinism is not an ideology
55,it is a complex biological hypothesis about the chain of being
56,it is not a wild syllogistic leap to infer that the ground rules of organic evolution might have some application to the organic institutions known as states
57,if new biological species evolve more rapidly and suc­ cessfully in isolation so might species of politics
58,if different environments call forth and stimulate immense powers of adaptation in all living things why should not a mosaic of the worlds or at least the wests population groups maximize such powers
59,primitive ethnostates once existed wherever iso­ lated tribes existed
60,several city states of ancient greece might have qualified as model ethnostates were it not for the greek propensity for slavery
61,reviewing the western past the author suggests that perhaps the closest political entities to what he has in mind were some city states in medieval italy and germany
62,today when we have virtually removed nature from our daily life it might be wise and timely to let her work her won­ ders again this time with intelligent human cooperation
63,at this point no one neither man nor nature is in charge of the selective process that lifted us out of the soup of a primeval sea
64,in fact in many areas of the world evolution seems to be running backwards
65,devoting some serious thought to devo­ lution and the ethnostate concept might help to put it back on track
66,chapter 1 up the devolution
67,the earths peoples are being herded into an ideological pen by advocates of globalism at the very moment large un­ wieldy political agglomerations like the soviet union are disin­ tegrating into states and regions with older and more authentic pedigrees
68,this political restructuring of the ussr has a special appeal to population groups that were forced to shed or dilute their historical uniqueness when they were incorporated into a large multiracial multicultural nation or empire
69,the united states has not yet reached the level of decomposition of what was once the communist fatherland but its cultural and racial centrifuge spins faster every month
70,it is hardly surprising that the population group which com­ prises the majority of a country will not voluntarily give up its preferred status or see its power appreciably weakened
71,no group wishes to watch what it regards as its own country being chopped up especially in the case where one or more minor­ ities has acquired as much or more political and economic power than what germans call the staatsvolk
72,some members of what was once a majority may be globalists at heart but they cannot stomach any political developments that success­ fully diminish their own sovereignty or elevated status
73,what has been largely missing from the devolution move­ ment so far has been a carefully formulated line of action to give it logical substance
74,one way to get in the devolutionary mood is to do some philosophical housecleaning
75,despite 5 6 the ethnostate what thomas jefferson has drilled into our heads life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not the beall and endall of the human condition
76,neither is that triplepronged french shibboleth liberte egalite jraternite nor the doltish marxist commandment from each according to his ability to each according to his needs
77,all these articles of faith were pro­ mulgated at times and places far removed from those which exist today
78,indeed mr jefferson we still are very interested in life
79,but today we want life for the planet not just for ourselveslife for plants animals protozoa and chromosomes
80,there was no such word as ecology at the time of the american french and russian revolutions
81,there is such a word today
82,all of us would do well to add it to our shrinking vocabulary
83,liberte
84,in our lifetime we have had some lost some and recovered some
85,the course of liberty often follows the arc of a pendulumfrom little to excessive and back to little again
86,most states at most times have had less rather than more liberty but kings priests lawyers even lowly citizens have at one moment or another enjoyed sufficient liberty of thought and action to try to loosen the shackles of church and state
87,taboos exist in totalitarian states taboos exist in democracies
88,breaking taboos in authoritarian regimes may mean death in democracies the penalty may be social ostracism and penury
89,in either case liberty is significantly curbed
90,liberty is always relative
91,essentially it is a byproduct of the will of the people the lay of the land and the condition of the state
92,those who cry for more liberty should really cry for a higher culture that recognizes the value of liberty
93,who or what can produce a higher culture
94,a more intelligent body politic would be a first step
95,egalite
96,no one is equal to anyone else not even identical twins
97,politicians in democracies instead of rhapsodizing over equality should accept the fact of human inequality and devote their talents to making the best not the worst of it
98,every sane person is fit for some occupation for some niche in life
99,constant appeals to equality become psychological sores
100,we are what we are
101,the trouble starts when we let envy the ethnostate 7 and resentment deny our differences
102,the acceptance and recognition of these variances is a brake to envy and a spur to a higher appreciation of the richness of the human tapestry
103,when equality is reduced from an impossible ideal and an excuse for violence to a meaningless cliche everyone will breathe easier
104,our stay on this blue planet is a short one
105,we should make the most of these fleeting moments and not waste them at the urging of demagogues who urge us to achieve the unachievable
106,let us be thankful for our inequality
107,what a drab world this would be if we were all cast in the same mold
108,fraternite
109,obviously all men have similarities just as they have differences
110,but they are never brothers
111,it is wiser to base our behavior on this truth than to pretend otherwise
112,our ability does not make us fraternal
113,fraternity applies to people who feel close to each other people of similar race and cul­ ture
114,to sell brotherhood to men and women of different races separated not only by genetics but by obvious differ­ ences in religion art language and historical background is an exercise in futility
115,the brotherhood based on slogans not genes will snap under the least pressure
116,like liberty and equality fraternity has a pretty sound but at bottom it is an ignis fatuus that has led us and continues to lead us into a quicksand of broken hopes and promises
117,woodrow wilson called on the brotherhood of man to make the world safe for democracy
118,communists called upon the proletariat to rise up and cast off its chains
119,all such words do is deceive good men by overloading their hearts with false expectations
120,as to the pursuit of happiness this materialistic hedon­ istic goal which tends to define mankind as a sort of pleasure­ seeking machine is hardly a worthy one
121,of all the pursuits to choose from happiness should come after not before edu­ cation art philosophy health and good government
122,hap­ piness can be pursued for itself but it is more likely to be achieved vicariously by the pursuit of more significant and meaningful goals
123,for this reason hedonism remains the great chink in jeffersons philosophical and political armor
124,men should respect not deify both individual and collective freedom
125,there are nobler and higher aims such as preparing 8 the elhnostate to climb the next rung in the evolutionary ladder
126,just as homo sapiens evolved from homo erectus and homo erectus from earlier hominids and earlier hominids from primates homo supersapiens must evolve from homo sap
127,the word must is used advisedly because the alternative to upward evolution is downward and retrograde evolution
128,if civiliza­ tion can slip back into barbarism as it often has who can say that this time it will not permanently remain in reverse gear
129,the scene in some of the worlds largest cities suggests that modem man is already degrading into a more primitive spe­ cies
130,who can know for certain that man will not some day decline into a lowerorder organism and disappear forever
131,the possibilities are endless for his downgoing the chances for his upgoing quite limited
132,if thanks to some beneficial mutation man has the ability and the will to make the quantum jump into a higher evolu­ tionary grade the question arises from what ethnic group will he emerge
133,everyone of course will root for his home team
134,members of the northern european branch of the white race who have been top dogs until recently should make every effort to keep their group in the pink of mental and physical condition if they are not going to lose out permanently to the japanese or members of some other mongoloid race
135,as with gifted children who are singled out and assigned to advanced classes so the more gifted members of every race should be provided with whatever is needed to help fulfill their individual and collective potential
136,it goes without saying that these spe­ cial students should not have their education slowed by being forced to move at the pace of less capable and less astute learners
137,gifted pupils often become so bored at the repetitive lessons required by the slow student that they may develop a lifelong antipathy to education
138,at the same time slow learners are made tragically aware of their own deficiencies by being compelled to compete with bright pupils
139,rather than con­ tinue this hopelessly unequal battle they drop out
140,when we speak of intelligence we mean more than verbal acumen and quick thinking
141,we are also speaking of such im­ portant character traits as a fine sense of moral responsibility the ethnostate 9 the ability to concentrate and a serious attitude towards life
142,the absence of these and similar traits in a genius with an iq of 180 could make him more of a menace than a boon to mankind
143,it follows that the population group best qualified to produce the ubermensch will need much more than a high genetic quotient of intelligence
144,assuming that members of the northern european branch of the white race and their descendants overseas are still con­ temporary favorites in the evolutionary race this is not to say that other races should consider themselves out of the running
145,genetics can play strange tricks
146,scores of white black and yellow launching pads should be constructed to speed the advent of a higher life form
147,in the meantime every race cannot help but obtain immense physical and mental benefits from strenuous competitive efforts in advancement
148,since this competition throws every population group back upon its own capabilities and resources it will discourage inter­ ference and bullying from other groups
149,nothing distorts and retards true cultural development more than interference by outsiders either through what is called cultural imperialism direct military intervention or massive immigration
150,one of the worst cases of what might be called culturecide was the wests highhanded intrusion into the lives and customs of the poly­ nesian peoples
151,white diseases white religion white trade white mores all combined to corrupt one of the worlds most color­ ful lifestyles
152,such acts of desecration with which history is replete must be stopped at all costs
153,invaders whether armed with holy books machine guns or alien customs bring with them cultural as well as physical diseases for which indigenous peoples have little or no immunity
154,the loss of morale and feelings of inferiority cased by the presence of techno­ logically and industrially advanced strangers can well be a prelude to ethnic dissolution and anomie
155,whatever lan the natives have managed to retain will be wasted on cultural preservation rather than on cultural advancement
156,separation and reduction into smallscale political units not accelerated coagulation into ever larger nations empires and spheres of interest should be the political prescription for the 10 the ethnostate future
157,but since this goes against the grain of globalist think­ ing which still holds sway in most western power centers devolution will only become mainstream politics after a revo­ lutionary shift in popular attitudes
158,some parts of the west have already entered a tentative de­ volutionary phase the centrifugal breakaway into disparate geographical racial and cultural divisions now occurring in eastern europe is resurrecting and accelerating longheld separatist feelings elsewhere
159,paradoxically separatism may be the wests best hope of holding together
160,only after the dis­ eased whole has fragmented can the pieces be rearranged reorganized and put back together to comprise a whole that is both healthier and greater than the sum of its parts
161,separatism
162,population groups are not equal no matter what liberal social scientists tell us either out of the goodness of their hearts or for less charitable reasons
163,the most effective method to reduce the social frictions caused by inherent group inequalities is separation a step which as we shall see further on in this study represents significant progress along the road to the ethnostate
164,inequalities become much more apparent and galling when different races and subraces are forced to live side by side where their unequal performance and differ­ ent behavior cannot be concealed
165,gathering men and women of similar biological and cultural background into a state of their own eliminates the invidious racial comparisons of test scores in classrooms and achieve­ ments in later life
166,in an ethnostate where the competition is limited to members of the same race no racial factors will be dredged up to explain why some citizens get ahead and some are left behind
167,whatever domestic disparities exist will have to be ascribed to individual and class differences
168,perhaps most important the envy and frustration inherent in losing will be greatly reduced
169,losers are less put out and an­ gered when they are beaten by one of their own kind
170,inequality among races living side by side sparks fearsome amounts of political economic and social stress
171,class inequal­ ities though always harbingers of instability seldom boil over the ethnostate 1 1 until the economic differences become so sharp that the poor are driven to desperation
172,individual inequalities incite crimi­ nality but otherwise are fairly manageable
173,despite their different prefixes devolution and evolution are synergistic that is they give each other a political and social boost
174,evolution propagates variety
175,opposing any drift to­ wards genetic sameness and cultural conformity tends to keep homo sapiens on a progressive evolutionary path
176,a world of political mosaics a world of etlmostates a devolutionary world keeps the faith so to speak with darwin and mendel
177,if mankind were one one plague might be its death knell
178,everyone would have the same lack of immunity to a new lethal disease
179,as an article in the los angeles times april 26 1990 put it if all family members are genetically alike all will respond to changes in their environment in the same way
180,if one cant survive all will perish
181,recall the irish famine of the 1840s
182,since all the potatoes were genetically similar there were no varieties to resist the fungus that caused anywhere from a million to two million deaths and changed the racial composition of the united states
183,had the irish cultivated several varieties of potatoes one or two might have had the genes to resist the fungus which would have saved much of the crop
184,a mono racial humanity would be extremely vulnerable to any outbreak of a serious infectious disease whereas the political and cultural isolation and geographical separation provided by ethnostates would significantly increase the possibility that some population groups would have varying degrees of resistance to different diseases either old or new
185,an increase in human variety would also mean an increase in the possibility of genetic improvements
186,mutations are always floating about in the hu­ man population most bad a few beneficial
187,variety increases not only the number of mutations but the chance that a very few of them the beneficial ones could actually be preserved and distributed throughout an entire ethnic group
188,in carefully tended gardens of genes who can say what bio­ logical blooms might eventually dazzle the eye
189,is it any won 12 the ethnostate der that the ethnostate can be designated as the one form of statehood with solid scientific underpinnings
190,we are told that some 95 of all the species that ever existed on this planet have become extinct
191,at the current rate of habitat destruction another million species of plants animals insects fish and birds will have disappeared by the end of this century
192,as a result several governments have established biospheres special environments to save endangered plants and animals from extinction
193,cary fowler director of the rural advancement fund international declares my guess is weve got another decade to collect genetic diversity or the games over
194,con­ sidered in this light the ethnostate concept gains greatly in importance
195,it promises a readymade biosphere for safe­ guarding not only plants and animals but also human beings
196,secession
197,one form of devolution is secession defined as the voluntary severance of one part of the body politic from the whole body
198,peaceful secession calls for the agreement of the two parties involved the secessionists and the rulers of the state from which they wish to secede
199,this agreement is gen­ erally hard to obtain with the result that secession has often provoked bloody civil wars one of the most notable being the fratricidal conflict in the united states in 186165 secession which is not always resisted or contested takes place most often during the disintegration of empires and multiracial states
200,a prime example or examples are the many secessions now underway in the detritus of the soviet union
201,in many such cases the spinoff allows longsuppressed peoples to rediscover their old identity and recover their longlost independence
202,the births of czechoslovakia hungary and yugoslavia successor states of the austrohungarian empire after world war i were sometimes violent sometimes peaceful exercises in devolution though the further fragmentation of yugoslavia seven decades later was bathed in blood
203,one of the sacred texts associated with an act of seces­ sion is the declaration of independence which begins when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with the ethnostate 13 another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and natures god entitle them  these lofty words written by a jefferson inspired by roseate visions of freedom and liberty were often heard in both the american revolution and the war between the states the first a violent but successful instance of secession the second a vio­ lent but unsuccessful one
204,the genetic damage suffered in the former conflict was minor
205,in the latter it was immense so immense that all the auvantages that came from binding the tom nation together and making possible its eventual rise to superpower status may have been negated by the loss of hun­ dreds of thousands of potential fathers and millions of unborn sons and daughters of the young nations founding stock
206,the severe drain on the reproductive potential of the core popula­ tion group opened the door to the importation of vast numbers of white immigrants of disparate races and cultures
207,secession being a very serious act it must at all costs be handled wisely and diplomatically
208,it would hardly be bene­ ficial to a population group to secede from a large state and establish its own ethnostate if the latter is immediately overrun and ravaged by the state from which it seceded or by a neigh­ boring nation with expansionist tendencies
209,it makes little sense for a new state to risk certain war or invasion while it is in its weak formative stages and while its chances of survival are minimal
210,secession should be carefully planned and only undertaken when the time is ripe and the possibility of success extremely high
211,as has happened all too often in history secessions have ended in massacres and in the extinction or near extinction of the secessionists
212,many perhaps most successful secessions have taken place in stages first a campaign for federation then for confeder­ ation then for partial autonomy as in the swiss cantons
213,the larger state will resist much less vigorously if it is prepared­ broken in as it werefor eventual separatism
214,when faced with a sudden separatist coup or jait accompli forceful re­ pression is not an uncommon response
215,14 the ethnostate devolutionaries
216,the thme of devolution has been touched on by other writers who while carefully avoiding the racial factor have pointed out that bigness is a principal cause of contemporary social problems
217,in his study the breakdown of nations leopold kohr an austrianborn economist advances a cyclic theory of history that oscillates slowly back and forth from what he calls districts and small city states to integra­ tionist empires the latter becoming so huge so far removed from mans original tribal state that they inevitably collapse of their own weight
218,the fragments then proceed to rearrange and reorganize themselves in more or less the same provinces regions territories or districts from which the nations and empires originally arose
219,in regard to old european provinces kohr writes their restoration would consequently not mean the creation of an artificial pattern but a return to europes natural political landscape
220,no new names would have to be invented
221,the old ones are still in exis­ tence as are the regions and peoples which they derme
222,it is the great powers which lack the real basis of existence and are without autochthonous selfsustaining sources of strength
223,it is they that are the artificial structures holding together a medley of more or less unwilling little tribes
224,there is no great british nation in great britain
225,what we find are the english scots irish cornish welsh and the islanders of man
226,in italy we find the lonibards tyroleans venetians sicilians or romans
227,in germany we find bavarians saxons hessians rhinelanders or brandenburgers
228,and in france we rmd normans catalans alsatians basques or burgundians
229,these little nations came into existence by themselves while the great powers had to be created by force and a series of bloodily unifying wars
230,e f schumacher pleads the case for smallness from a less political and more aesthetic perspective
231,in his bestseller small is beautiful he catalogs all the various aspects of culture that have become too large either to be understood or appreciated
232,the late germanborn architect mies van der rohe although he has designed several large buildings in north america became at least a parttime member of the micro club following the utterance of his widely publicized aphorism less is more
233,no one has put the case for ethnostates in more concise and more convincing words than bob hunter in his column for the north shore news june 6 1990 a small suburban paper in the ethnostate 15 vancouver british columbia if the world was to be divided up into say 2500 little countries and the boundaries of each country were drawn to fit the contours of the national biological regions the natives inhabited each country would become responsible for a shared biozone  in theory the inhabitants of each such region would have every reason to work together to preserve their area
234,moreover because they were indigenous
235,they could be counted on to have the best understanding of how to truly manage the environment
236,hunter compared the soviet union before its dissolution to canada in tenns that would delight the most straitlaced ethno­ statists neither nation has any organic tribal basis
237,each represents a long string of conquests and occupations and deals and ripoffs culminating in two almost polaropposite political systems which are nevertheless almost identical at their core canada and the ussr are incredibly centralized bloated administrations both of them  both are bureau­ cracies gone mad
238,having far too much control over affairs in distant parts of the imperium
239,hunter might have included the united states in the above paragraph
240,however neither kohr schumacher nor hunter penetrated the heart of the matter because none based his devolutionary proposals on the racial element which can make or break any political entity
241,kohr advocates the breakup of the superstates into small states but never mentions the all­ important biological aspect of the geographical and demo­ graphical shrinkage he is advocating
242,small states that are home to several races and several cultures are no more indeed often less stable than heterogeneous superstates
243,the provinces and districts that kohr praises were and in many cases still are monoracial
244,yet he avoids any allusion to their racial homo­ geneity
245,nor will he admit that his cyclic theory of history does not apply to most of the worlds black and brown societies many of which have never ventured into bigness
246,as the odinist vol
247,95 1986 comments if a societys physical size alone were the determining factor in unleashing its creativity
248,then every race
249,every people and every nation at some time or another should have experienced a blossoming of culture comparable to that of europe at its minuscule best
250,such has definitely not been the case
251,16 the ethnostate similarly schumacher advances almost every argument he can summon up to make his case for smallness except the monoracial one
252,kohr was half right in predicting the instability of nations and empires once they approached gigantism
253,but he was probably wrong when he wrote that fragmentation will only occur after a war between the superpowers
254,the soviet union has already fissioned and there is as yet no world war iii in sight though smaller regional wars are always a possibility particularly in ethnic hot spots like south africa and the mid­ dle east
255,as for the fission of the only remaining superpower forces are currently at work which practically ensure that the america of ad 2050 will bear little resemblance in size and shape to the america of the 1990s
256,manageable size
257,the basic sine qua non of an ethnostate the prop on which it succeeds or fails is racial and cultural homogeneity
258,we have already suggested that a second prop almost as basic is smallness
259,no government can be truly effective over the long haul if it presides over a huge territory no matter how well integrated racially and culturally the popu­ lation may be
260,the more distant geographically government is from the governed the more removed it will be from the real concerns of its people
261,before proceeding any further it should be pointed out that the size of the ethnostate not only refers to territory but also to population
262,if the personalization of government is to be one of the ethnostates principal aims the governed must not exceed a reasonable number
263,it is simply impossible for even the most ingenious statesmen to govern a country of 50 100 or 200 million people without losing the personal touch that makes government acceptable supportive and supportable thomas jeffersons emphasis on ward government in which most of the governing is exercised at the local level almost seems as if he had an ethnostate in mind
264,a small state with a small homogeneous population is obviously easier to manage than a large state with a heterogeneous population
265,anyone who has ever attended a town meeting in a large city would the ethnostate 17 probably agree
266,more often than not sllch confabs break up into acrimonious shouting matches
267,most large states obviously have an advantage over small ones in military resources though not necessarily in military morale
268,accordingly all ethnostates should be kept as small as possible both in regard to territory and population if only to prevent the formation of big states whose size alone might tempt them to overwhelm a smaller neighbor
269,for defense against large ethnostates and large states that have not yet become ethnostates economic and military alliances should be entered into by the smaller states to protect their sovereignty
270,large states that exhibit signs of aggression should be in­ formed in no uncertain terms that an attack on one member of such an alliance would be viewed as an attack on all members
271,as will be pointed out in chapter 5 nuclear weapons by their very awesomeness favor the defense of small states
272,what benefits would victory in war bring to an empire or nation that lost half or more of its industry its cities and its population to a few wellaimed nuclear warheads on longrange missiles
273,the small state that launched the missiles would be utterly destroyed
274,but at what cost to the large state
275,because they sti11live in the worlds largest territorial state some russians would like to see their ponderous russian federation divided into a european russia and an asian russia siberia
276,japan the largest homogeneous nation has far too many people for personalized government
277,the japanese if made aware of the advantages of decentralized rule might allow greater autonomy to their reconstituted historical pro­ vinces and to their small and powerless ainu and korean minorities
278,japan by the way is not so culturally homo­ geneous that the japanese cannot tell the geographical or provincial origins of their fellow citizens by their accents
279,canada another of the gargantuan states has already entered a centrifugal phase
280,the frenchspeaking part of the country is moving towards almost total independence while in western canada an increasingly vocal movement wants to secede from the government in ottawa and shake off the financial control of toronto
281,after quebec spins off nova scotia and new 18 the ethnostate foundland will be cut off from the rest of englishspeaking canada
282,there is already talk in these two provinces about joining the united states
283,america another grotesquely oversized nation has already become a mosaic though not quite the gorgeous mosaic of new york city mayor david dinkins
284,hispanics largely from mexico crowd the southwest
285,cubans have all but taken over south horida
286,negroes 30 million strong are jammed into innercity ghettos and scattered throughout the rural south
287,large numbers of jews representing the top economic eche­ lons in the largest cities are particularly influential in new york los angeles and washington
288,southern and eastern europeans populate the shrinking industrial areas of the east and midwest
289,most americans of british descent have deserted the cities for the suburbs
290,most germans and scandinavians live in the midwest
291,french canadians have concentrated in northern new england irish in urban areas scotch irish in the south most asians in hawaii and california most indians on their reservations
292,all these bits and pieces of american demo­ graphy are available if not yet willing to be transformed with greater or lesser difficulty into separate ethnostates
293,no hard and fast limits should be set on the size of an ethnostates population and territory
294,there are too many im­ ponderables and exceptions
295,maximum area might be 36000 square miles roughly that of portugal maximum population 15 million the number of hollanders
296,but racial and cultural homogeneity must be the deciding factors not area and popu­ lation
297,identity
298,one of the great psychological props of the ethno­ state is that it will provide its citizens with a sense of identity which in these pluralistic times is often hard to come by
299,identity starts with self proceeds to the family and extends to the neighborhood town city county borough department france state us and germany and finally to the nation
300,remove any of these orbits surrounding the ethnic nucleus and a persons sense of identity is greatly weakened
301,throughout the west individual and group identity is at risk the ethnostate 19 because it is increasingly difficult for a citizen of a multiracial nation to feel he has much in common with a fellow citizen who it is increasingly likely may be of a different race and have emerged from an entirely different cultural background
302,the more people differ racially and culturally within a country the more difficult it becomes for members of these different races to believe they share a common peoplehood
303,as a result in a heterogeneous state the basic psychological need of every human being the firm sense of belonging is in short supply
304,the german word heimat has a stronger emotional tug than homeland but both words convey the same meaning
305,heimat stands for more than country or nation
306,it is a state of mind a form of allegiance an intensified feeling of belonging
307,it is the deep affection of the part for the whole
308,heimat fuses the identity of the individual with the identity of the group and the habitat of the group
309,it incites people to capitalize on their cultural and genetic endowment
310,people who live in a multi­ racial or multicultural state do not have a h eimat
311,individual and group identity can be viewed as the back­ bone of the human psyche an unbent vertebra of pride behav­ ior and character
312,much is made these days of individual rights
313,heimat is a group right
314,heimat is sichfinden not merely finding oneself but finding ones self
315,every state worthy of the name recognizes the need for every individual and every family to have a home
316,the ethnostate is designed to fulfill the equally important need of all men and women for a community for a collective home
317,can a persons nationality be identified by his appearance dress and behavior
318,in some areas of the world the answer is still an automatic yes
319,not so long ago practically everyone on earth carried his birthplace or citizenship on his sleeve
320,tall blond longheaded men or women were tagged as northern europeans or at least of northern european descent
321,until the 1950s an american was not an indian negro or asian not even a dark white from mediterranean lands he was a member of the dominant mostly faircomplexioned race from northern and western europe that in a few centuries had 20 the ethnostate turned a sparsely inhabited wilderness into a thriving world power
322,the word alienation a favorite of hegel and marx ade­ quately describes the pessimistic mood of the majority of whites in the largest western cities which have become refuges for myriads of immigrants who neither look speak nor act like their hosts the numbers of whom are now declining as fast as the numbers of newcomers are multiplying
323,when strangers comprise a significant portion of the population of a country when outsiders form their own neighborhoods in what was once our neighborhoods we start to have doubts about who we are
324,whites in america used to be told that they were not only white but belonged to a certain group of whites
325,since the 1930s however few anthropologists have written or lectured about the racial differences that distinguish many northern europeans nordics from central europeans alpines and southern europeans mediterraneans
326,today partly due to the lack of such information miscegenation in or out of mar­ riage is busy dissolving racial distinctions almost everywhere in the west
327,massive immigration forced integration in education employment and public housing the low birthrate of whites and high birthrate of nonwhitesal1 such factors are watering down and in some cases obliterating the objective and sub­ jective ways people depend on to establish and solidify their group consciousness
328,since the loss of identity affects the group as much as the individual the difficulties of governing mount as the cen­ trifugal forces that pull nations neighborhoods and families apart grow stronger and the centripetal forces that bind them together grow weaker
329,the upshot is that multiracial states the states most seriously threatened by the dynamics of fragmen­ tation are offered a choice of two alternatives either to hold the centrifugal forces in check by some form of absolutism or succumb to them and let the state dissolve into smaller more homogeneous substates where bonds of race culture and his­ tory are strong enough to keep the social order functioning
330,an important psychological factor must be reckoned with in the ethnostate 21 any serious discussion of alienation at the national level
331,what happens when most of the inhabitants of a country no longer employ the personal pronoun we in describing themselves and their fellow citizens
332,if the country has become a welter of different races and cultures the we will eventually come to stand for nothing more than a group of occupants of a particular geographical or demo graphical segment of the country in question
333,it is a truism that the average individual will generally fight to protect himself his family and his property
334,but will he fight for what he no longer feels is his if we no longer exists and has been replaced by them
335,it is at this point that the intensity or lack of intensity of group consciousness may actually determine the groups­ and the statessurvival
336,the symbol of america uncle sam still displays white featuresat least at this writing
337,but how much longer will 30 million negroes 22 million hispanics and millions of asians be content to accept a national logo or trademark which represents a race different· from their own
338,what will be the color of uncle sam when nonwhites outnumber whites some­ time in the middle of the 21st century if present immigration and birthrate trends continue
339,symbols in the form of flags national anthems even racial stereotypes can be effective in bringing and holding people together
340,but when they are no longer symbolic of the population at large they become divi­ sive
341,the expression my country generally includes a men­ tal picture of a flag a series of remembered historical events and the faces of noted public figures
342,but when the parapher­ nalia of patriotism becomes less and less meaningful to an ever larger share of the population unity transmogrifies into dis­ unity
343,instead of a common history each population group begins to compose its own interpretation of the past
344,it is not just race that divides one nation from another and one man from another
345,distance and geographical isolation economic and regional distinctions language and historical differences all playa part
346,only rarely do racial similarity and a shared culture overcome linguistic differences as in switzer­ land or religious differences as in halfprotestant and half 22 the ethnostate catholic holland
347,in good economic times in times of prosperity low un­ employment and high morale the bonding forces of the state are weakened only to strengthen again in a political or eco­ nomic crisis or after defeat in war
348,when most everyone is doing fairly well and advancing a few notches on the comfort scale racial and cultural antagonisms have a tendency to be sidetracked
349,they quickly come to the fore again when the unemployment rate mounts and family budgets decline to a bare subsistence level
350,rules of the game
351,the etlmostate is intended to set the stage for the next step in political evolution perhaps even human evolution
352,it represents a sweeping new approach to politics one that differs greatly from the new world order the wilsonian proclamation that emanated from the mouth of president george bush during his war against iraq
353,to narrow the fight for racial survival on appeals to tradition and the glories of tpe past definitely becomes counterproductive
354,such outworn pleading no longer evokes any genuine responsy from political activists
355,it tells them that it is high time for them to become statesmen and political philosophers high time for them to come up with something new something right for the times something to lift hearts
356,if the earth a lonely planet in a lonely galaxy had feelings they might resemble those of presentday whites caught in the etlmic kaleidoscope of a multiracial state
357,races cannot save other races races can only save them­ selves
358,the beauty of the etlmostate is that although it rests solidly on race it promises great benefits to all races
359,in no way does it suggest the superiority of anyone race subrace or population group
360,the predicament of whites in america and to a lesser extent of whites in other parts of the fading white world is that many of them know what should be done but are ashamed to lift a finger
361,the media having made any commonsensical ap­ proaches to race disrespectable many whites are afraid to make known their unwavering dislike for the shape and con the ethnostate 23 tent of what is called popular opinion the erroneous term given to a distillate of the opinions of special interest groups
362,what a strange breed of prisoners whites have become
363,they know how to escape but are afraid to take the first step
364,they know where the reef is but keep sailing directly into it
365,if whites really believed that the present trend of political economic and social decay was irreversible they would not try to slow the downhill rush but accelerate it
366,with the arrival of total chaos proposals for drastic solutions would become less censored and more popular
367,whites would have a better chance of surviving if they could start with a clean slate provided enough whites still remained to build on the ruins
368,in political geography smallness is not necessarily a hand­ icap or a sign of weakness
369,a small preponderantly euro­ american state cut out of the dying husk of america would be a step forward not a step backward in statecraft
370,the separ­ atism already rampant in the late 20thcentury united states would make the task of forming ethnostates much easier
371,the negroization and hispanicizing of some of the largest amer­ ican cities have aided and abetted white flight to the suburbs
372,the population shifts have not gone unnoticed by the two major political parties
373,as the trend continues and race despite laws and regulations to the contrary becomes the crucial determinant of living space whites will be more reluctant than ever to associate with nonwhites
374,the condition of the iiuler cities is such that no promises or bribes from an integrationist government would be sufficient to persuade white families particularly those that managed to escape to move there
375,the free riders of civilizations the worshippers of material­ ism the liberal and conservative stickinthemuds the relig­ ious hierarchs the fanatic defenders of the status quo the rich who fear that change any change will upset their golden applecartsall such creatures will strongly oppose any serious step towards activating the ethnostate solution
376,their primary tactic will be to accuse ethnostate proponents of deliberately and maliciously trying to destroy a great country with a great history for a variety of evil purposes
377,as mentioned previously ethnostates will not preclude cer 24 the ethnostate tain interregional organizationsin conformity with the thesis that the politics of the future calls for more organization at the bottom a measure of organization at the top and much less organization in the middle
378,nations nationhood and nation­ ality since they have outgrown their original meanings should go the way of chattel slavery and child labor
379,vive la difference must be the watchword of all those really interested in ele­ vating mankind to a higher more intelligent and more creative level of social organization
380,the economy of the west peaked in the 1980s in an orgy of hedonistic produce and consume
381,beholden as ever to the peri­ odic curve the economy soon ushered in the belttightening recession of the early 1990s
382,without the racial irritant the ethnostate would be better able than multiracial states to straighten out the curve
383,a small homogeneous state even in the worst of times is often better equipped to ride out eco­ nomic booms and busts if only because its small size makes its economy more flexible more resilient and more resistant to control by the vast bureaucracies and mountains of regulations of big government that prevent or fatally postpone remedial action jefferson was probably right about economic stagnation being a serious threat to liberty
384,he thought it critically impor­ tant that in a crisis individuals be in a position to exercise their creative and entrepreneurial powers with minimal govern­ mental interference
385,he understood that an economy can hardly flourish in a nation constantly at war with its neighbors
386,it cannot flourish any better in a nation constantly at war with itself
387,trends
388,for a great part of the world the 20th century has not been an era of peace and plenty
389,accordingly since both fusion and fission pressures are simmering almost everywhere two powerful political vectors are taking shape
390,one points backward towards more centralization and authoritarianism the other forward towards devolution and separatism
391,it is in step with the latter trend that the concept of the ethnostate assumes greater relevance and immediacy
392,the ethnostate 25 as mentioned previously racial integration in the united states has been countered by white flight to the suburbs and rural areas
393,simultaneously legal and illegal immigrants from mexico and other parts of latin america are spreading across the face of the land after taking over large areas of southern california
394,the cubanization of south florida proceeds apace though there may be some reflux to cuba when fidel castro resigns dies in bed or goes the way of his brother dictator in romania
395,concurrently soviet jews are arriving by the tens of thousands
396,in accord with their innate predisposition for urban living they prefer to settle in new york los angeles and other megalopolitan areas only a selfprotective raceminded people could effectively stop this massive influx
397,since no powerful antiimmigration party has yet appeared in the united states or elsewhere in the west with the exception of the national front in france the racial composition of most western countries is destined to further change
398,it had been thought that an economic down­ turn in the host countries might slow or reverse the legal and illegal immigrant flow
399,but to the average undocumented worker unemployment in an industrial nation is preferable to a job in his homeland
400,the standard of living he and his large hispanic family enjoy while on welfare in california texas and florida offer them little incentive to return to their hovel in latin america
401,it need not be emphasized that these demographic shifts offer many arguments and some opportunities for the estab­ lishment of ethnostates
402,whether the wests core population groups will have sufficient numbers and sufficient will to found such states against the violent opposition of racial inte­ grationists open border liberals and dedicated egalitarians is problematic
403,with regard to the united states the most sen­ sible peaceful and democratic solution would be the division of the country into an hispanic state in the southwest a cuban state in south florida a black state somewhere in the rural south and a series of independent jewish black and asian enclaves in the cities and closein suburbs where these groups comprise sizable elements of the population
404,indians would 26 the ethnostate keep their reservations which would be combined into ethno­ states and placed largely under their control
405,in respect to white nonjewish ethnostates the united states has no provinces or city states on the historic european model
406,it does however have regions with historical and cultural tra­ ditionsthe deep south appalachia texas once an inde­ pendent republic new england the farm belt and the north­ west
407,both geography and demography would qualify such areas for ethnostatehood
408,where the population has become a welter of different ethnic factions in large metropolitan areas neighborhoods could be the loci for political economic and social groupings
409,though too small to qualify as ethnostates they would be accorded as much independence as reasonably possible
410,unwary allies
411,there are more than a few contemporary political movements nudging the west in the direction of an ethnostate solution though the promoters would stren­ uously deny having any truck whatever with the theme of this book
412,one such movement bioregionalism is the stamping ground of environmental activists greens earth firsters and a smattering of farout liberals and politically interested or disinterested conservationists
413,thirty delegates took part in the first bioregional congress held in missouri in october 1980 in the course of which they made plans to set up an ecologically balanced community in ozarkia
414,proposals for other bioregions included cascadia in western washington state siskiyou in northern california and katuah in southern appalachia
415,two hundred delegates representing 80 organizations met in the north american bioregional congress held near kansas city mo in 1984 the following is an excerpt from their statement of principles bioregionalism recognizes nurtures sustains and celebrates our local connections with land plants and animals rivers lakes and oceans air families friends and neighbors community native traditions and systems of production and trade
416,it is taking the time to learn the possi­ bilities of place
417,it is a mindfulness of local environment history and community aspirations that can lead to a future of safe and sustainable life
418,the ethnostate 27 unfortunately the bioregional movement soon broke up into squabbling factions
419,in los angeles one group held compost toilet beach parties filed suit against a score of nations which possessed or supposedly possessed nuclear weapons and published something called a bikeshevik manifesto
420,the ozark area community congress came out for tree rights animal rights bacteria rights even virus rights
421,the enemy was the anglos of north america who continue to rape the land although it was these very anglos who headed up organizations such as the sierra club that were doing the most to protect the environment
422,other bioregional splinter groups dabbled in feminism marxism and terrorism
423,the latter spiked trees blocked the entrance to cobalt mines and created general mayhem throughout large areas of the west
424,one faction lauded the sandinista regime in nicaragua for its agricultural policies
425,bioregionalists have deliberately avoided the racial factor in their plans and projects
426,ecological balance can hardly be obtained without a balanced population
427,all too frequently the bioregional movement has fallen into the hands of rootless intellectuals who are the least fit of all persons to establish bioregions where roots are of paramount importance
428,allan carlson the editor of persuasion at work a publi­ cation put out by the rockford institute writes true communities are rooted in a selfsacrificing love of soil family and tradition and in the individuals willingness to serve as an exemplar and defender of these
429,in contrast bioregionalist loyalties have more to do with hate than 10ve  intense hatred for others spills over into selfhate which simply put does not inspire sacrifice and cannot sustain community action over time
430,there has been some meaningful political activity in europe on behalf of various aspects of bioregionalism mainly by green parties who have seats in the parliaments of several european countries
431,but most greens like most american bioregionalists are more interested in talk than action
432,they constantly theorize about saving the environment while evincing varying degrees of affection for erstwhile marxist governments that have probably done more lasting damage to natures kingdom chernobyl soft coal mining and ancient 28 the ethnostate factories that eruct more pollution than products than all the industrial nations of the west put together
433,bioregionalism relies on geography and nature not race to determine the location size and shape of a state
434,those areas of the earths surface which have similar weather terrain flora arid fauna should in the bioregionists view be detached from huge unwieldy nation states and reorganized into separate and independent political units
435,the founding father of bioregionalism is swiss biologist raymond dasmann whose monograph published in 1973 by the union for conservation of nature and natural resources in morges switzerland defined bioregions as ecologically uniform areas where the native species of plants and animals vary by no more than 20
436,in bioregions dasmann wrote people find a sense of identity and peace and learn to recognize flora and fauna to respond to its climatic regime to become familiar with its limits
437,picking up on dasmann poet allen van newkirk founded the institute for bioregional research in nova scotia and dedi­ cated it to the reconstruction of wild areas that had been deformed as he described it by culture
438,to achieve his objective he advocated the use of language poetry and myth as tools of bioregional cognition of the indoeuropean amerindian and other traditions
439,one of the more prominent spokesmen for bioregionalism is kirkpatrick sale a strident luddite who deplores science and wants us all to return to the bosom of the earth goddess gaea
440,the following is taken from his article in the summer 1983 issue of the green revolution a bioregion is part of the earths surface where there is a moreoriess distinct geographical
441,biological
442,horticultural and climatic identity
443,from which the human inhabitants have developed a moreoriess distinct economic
444,social and cultural identity
445,a watershed or river basin is perhaps the most obvious type of bioregion though there can be many othersa valley say or a desert
446,or a plateau
447,the borders between them are usually not rigid  but the regions themselves are not hard to identify when once we pay attention to natures patterns rather than those of some government
448,the bioregions then are natures givens
449,the ecological truths of our earth
450,it would behoove us to pay more attention to them
451,and soon
452,as to how we pay attention that takes us to selfsufficiency  there is not a single bioregion in this the ethnostate 29 country that would not if it looked to all its resources be able to provide its own abundant food its own energy its own shelter and clothing its own health and medical care its own arts and manufactures and industries  and where this or that material or resource may be missing it is not long before human ingenuity is able to contrive a substitute  if necessity is the mother of invention then self­ sufficiency is its grandmother
453,sale asks the question whether it is right for new york city to import 29000 tons of broccoli a year from california when it could just as easily get that amount of broccoli from its own bioregion
454,he wonders whether it is not madness for manhattan to be totally dependent on the sacramento and san joaquin valleys 2600 miles to the west for almost all its vegetables and much of its fruit
455,he lists the costs of this crosscountry supply line the huge annual expenditures for fossil fuels the heavy toll on the overloaded highway system the increased pollution and congestion and finally the decline in nutritional quality owing to the large amounts of chemical preservatives needed to keep food fresh during shipment
456,in new york and new jersey sale continues farmers are squeezed out of business their lands sold and turned into shopping malls and condominiums
457,people continue to crowd into megalopolitan anthills as vast expanses of rural america become increasingly impoverished
458,agribusiness rips up the countryside he solemnly intones and rips off the pub­ lic
459,the topsoil and water resources are depleted and exhaust­ ed
460,pesticides and fertilizers pose health risks to both grower and consumer
461,it is true sale admits that selfsufficiency demands some extra work and may require some change in eating habits though only in
462,the direction of fresher more nutritional more healthful foods
463,it is also true that an autarkic econ­ omy means giving up certain imports though almost any that are truly valuable can be produced locally or substituted for in one way or another
464,according to sale a selfstarting bioregion is  more sta­ ble it has more control over its economy it is not at the mercy of boomandbust cycles
465,it is not another countrys eco­ nomic vassal
466,30 the ethnostate it is able to plan to allocate its resources to develop what it wants to develop at the safest pace in the most ecological manner  it is of necessity a more cohesive more selfregarding selfconcerned spot of earth with a sense of place of comradeship of community with the kind of character that is built on stability pride competence control and independence
467,in his summary sale asserts that a selfcontained bioregion brings out the best in people because it forces them to rely on their own devices to depend on what is local and at hand not on commodities and energy sources from some remote coun­ try whose emir can double or triple prices by merely issuing a ukase
468,selfreliant individuals had best be able to cook and sew and harvest and chop wood and build and repair so they can become jacks and jills of all trades
469,rather than simplify bioregionalists will have to complexify in order to ward off the many dangers posed by monopoly and monotony
470,one of the most overlooked dangers is the economy of scale which limits factories to a single product people to a single job jobs to a single motion motions to a single purpose
471,man has climbed to the top of the evolutionary heap in sales opinion precisely because of his capacity for diversifi­ cation
472,human organizations are most productive and dynamic when they are capable of responding to all sorts of challenges
473,they become brittle and unadaptable when robotized and specialized
474,when men and women are able to take on many jobs learn many skills live many roles they reach their full potential
475,a bioregion that develops a multiplicity of ways of caring for itself
476, becomes textured and enriched
477,there is more than a hint of rousseaus noble savage in sales utopia
478,in one flight of fancy he suggests that the american indians should be his strongest supporters
479,playing the politically correct game he never utters a syllable about race
480,though the success of any bioregion would depend pri­ marily on the capabilities and talents of its inhabitants sale bowing low to the prevailing taboo carefully omits mentioning the biological aspects and requirements of his proposed social order
481,instead he resorts to some heavy thinking about ecody­ namism empowerment and an integrated state of maturity
482,another proponent of ideas that harmonize to some degree the ethnostate 31 with the ethnostate is the previously mentioned ef schu­ macher whose blistering attacks on huge uncontrollable nation states and appeals for reducing them to a governable size provide a strong endorsement for the politics of fission
483,like sale however schumacher scrupulously avoids the sub­ iect of race in his plea for political economic and social devo­ lution
484,schumacher a prominent british economist goes well be­ yond considering his field of expertise to be the dismal science
485,he treats it as a dirty science that in its present state places far too much emphasis on mass production profit growth and economies of scaleall to the great detriment of the environment
486,he advocates introducing moral and psycho­ logical factors into economics to balance its topheavy materialism
487,big corporations should be broken up into semi­ independent units
488,small businesses should be helped and encm  aged
489,every effort should be made to provide useful work to every adult
490,claiming that only 35 of the earths inhabitants actually produce anything and that only onethird do any work at all schumacher proposes increasing the proportion of producers to at· least 20 of the work force
491,better to have millions working with their own tools and hands than to have robots and computers putting vast numbers of people out of work
492,to bring off this economic revolution successfully some central planning would be needed much to the dismay of freemarket enthusiasts who are against state planning per se and would never agree that a planned economy can operate more effi­ ciently and effectively in a small state than in a large one
493,factoring morality and environment into economic programs would be a much easier task in small countries where the radical changes schumacher suggests could be more closely monitored
494,schumacher condemns capitalism for thriving on greed
495,he is against socialism for its tendency to develop massive in­ human bureaucracies
496,what he would like to see at least in the third world would be two million villages inhabited by two billion villagers
497,he decries the spread of urbanization the 32 the ethnostate everdeclining number of small farms and the takeover of agriculture by agribusiness with its soildestroying and poisonous pesticides
498,he would place a cap of half a million on the population of cities
499,in many ways schumacher can be classified as a reaction­ ary
500,he rails against nuclear· energy space exploration and practically all scientific and technological work that does not promote some aspect of humanitarianism
501,he deplores the faustian spirit which has lifted man above all other animals sent him off on fantastic missions to the edge of the solar system and may one day take him to the edge of the universe
502,schumacher is right about technology and science needing a more human face but he is dead wrong if it must be achieved at the cost of padlocking our laboratories and returning to a bucolic existence
503,there is a fire in man that simply will not be extinguished
504,because it occasionally flames out of control and does some damage is no reason for snuffing it out
505,much of what dismays schumacher is the ability of the west to impress its values on the third world
506,although he would probably be loath to admit it the ethnostate which favors the implosion not the explosion of culture and prefers cultural separation to cultural integration would be a giant step to­ wards realizing many of his ideas
507,leopold kohr whose devolutionary proposals for european nations have already been briefly noted has proposed some specific limitations on area and population to bring about what he calls the optimum state
508,in his scholarly book the overdeveloped nations he writes that platos ideal city state had a population of 5040 and that thomas more populated his utopian municipality with 6000 families
509,kohrs own proposed communities would have between 7000 to 12000 people enough to provide the basic amenities
510,for cultural amenitiestheaters art galleries museums churches univer­ sitiesthe population should range from 50000 to 200000 the renowned city states of ancient greece and renaissance italy he informs us rarelyhad more than 200000 inhabitants
511,politics kohr writes gets out of hand when the population goes much over the 200000 mark
512,he warns that the normal the ethnostate 33 functions of government will break down completely if the population of a city exceeds 12 to 15 million
513,kohr pays particular attention to aristotles brilliant comments on the effect of size on human endeavors
514,no matter how strong the state unbraked growth will constantly eat at its foundations
515,kohr believes that size when applied to states has four com­ ponents number density integration and velocity
516,all else being equal a closely packed population is larger than the same number of people spread over a wide area
517,a state con­ sisting of several distinct population groups with different racial and cultural backgrounds will be less dense than a homogeneous state of the same size
518,a state with a boundto­ thesoil farm population with poor transportation will have less velocity and thus be classified as smaller than an indus­ trialized hightech state with heavy commuter traffic even if the populations of both states are equal in number according to kohr the reason some vast overextended empires remained viable so long despite their size was their policy of decentralization
519,power to the provinces which be­ came in effect independent states was the policy of the later roman empire
520,the strength of the united states is or was its emphasis on federation
521,if kohr is right the usurpation of states rights by the presidency congress and the supreme court is the tocsin that tolls americas death knell
522,kohr points out that britain shorn of empire is a richer and more successful state at least when measured by the living standards of its citizens
523,another reason for its present stability and prosperity is parliaments recognition of the nationalist feelings of the welsh and the scots
524,in the 1959 british general elections 80000 welsh voted for plaid cymru the party that demands complete independence for wales
525,if kohrs theories are even partially valid any oversized nation is doomed especially if it is oversized in all of kohrs four categories
526,the soviet union fell apart since it exceeded kohrs population limits density and centralization
527,only the ussrs velocity component remained within acceptable bounds
528,in kohrs opinion the fragmentation of the united states will not lag far behind the disintegration of the soviet 34 the ethnostate union
529,this means that for americans the ethnostate solution moves further into the realm of possibilityand necessity­ with every passing day
530,let us put aside for the moment the objection that the regrouping of population groups of similar genetic and cul­ tural background into ethnostates would involve such an extensive loss of property and result in so much violence that the fiercest opponents to this revolutionary or more accur­ ately this evolutionary step would be the white majorities
531,let us admit that even under the most favorable conditions any ethnostates carved out of the united states would face im­ mense difficulties
532,the author concedes all these objections have some validity but wishes to point out that the ideas being floated here are not concerned with the present but with the future not with conditions as they exist today or tomorrow but with those that will exist the day after tomorrow when ameri­ cansand perhaps europeanswill have reached the point where they will have to choose between ethnostates or no state at all
533,chapter 2 the mortality of culture races are organisms with limited life spans
534,cultures can be viewed as organisms the existence and duration of which often seems synchronized with the life span of a particular race tribe or population group
535,when a culture changes as it does when outsiders take possession of it it dies in the sense that it loses most of its original content
536,it may leave behind some residues just as a father leaves behind some of his genes to his children
537,but the child is never the same as the father and the successor culture is never tht same as the culture that preceded it
538,organisms expire from many causesold age disease acci­ dent even from despair
539,the causes of cultural death are not too dissimilar
540,a culture grows repetitive stodgy and senile as an aging human does
541,it may be corrupted and perverted when in full flower
542,unforeseen historical happenstances can kill a culture as efficiently as a headon collision with another auto­ mobile can wipe out a family on a sunday drive
543,the wrong military alliance at the wrong time a drastic change in the weather the depletion of critical resourcesany of these factors or all working together can mortally wound a culture
544,tradition is the atmosphere in which culture breeds and breathes
545,never to be discounted is the cumulative effect of cultural aggression carried on by outsiders who pose as insid­ ers
546,in such cases tradition is no longer a shield but a punching bag
547,man a partner of nature cooperates with nature to produce 35 36 the ethnostate the phenomenon of culture
548,to say that culture is separate from man or independent of man is to say that atoms have no connection with their molecules
549,human life adapts to a particular environment and in the process produces a particu­ lar type of man
550,there is no dividing or compartmentalizing the process
551,once man settles in a specific environment he may remain longer than the environment itself which when largely manmade can change faster than man in some cases faster than man can catch up with it
552,the hereditarian puts too much emphasis not on the impor­ tance of inheritance but on man in general as if man was a thing apart
553,gung ho environmentalists commit a grave sin by giving mans biological component only a fraction of the im­ portance and influence accorded to culture and nature
554,yet man as has already been pointed out is a part of nature and at the same time the key component of culture
555,nurturists will surely comprise some of the bitterest oppo­ nents of the ethnostate which calls for biological restructuring to precede cultural restructuring
556,a state based on racial and cultural similarity can have little appeal to those who consider race a stumbling block and culture a selfgenerated construct that springs fully grown and ramified like athena from the forehead of zeus
557,the ethnostateoffers no false dawns no airy promises that groups from less complex cultures when brought into contact with more complex ones will acquire in a decade or two what it took another breed of humans centuries to develop
558,it is both unhealthy and impractical for a culture to borrow from another what it could not create under its own power
559,the less articulated culture then assumes a burden it is incapable of carrying
560,sooner or later cultural accretions are likely to be rejected just as the transplant recipient may reject a new heart or kidney
561,is there some kind of biological pulse some kind of pul­ monary rhythm at work in races which causes them to have slower heartbeats and to breathe more slowly than their human components
562,as he ages the individual becomes ever more aware of death which when it overtakes him becomes a matter the ethnostate 37 of public record
563,no one ever really knows exactly when a culture dies
564,unawareness of death even at the moment it strikes makes it difficult to date a cultures life span
565,the question of art and nonart
566,what is the sense of telling someone a story if the listener cannot understand what he is being told
567,if art a form of communication fails to communicate it fails in its main purpose
568,the only ones who understand the incomprehensible work of modern artists are their agents a few rootless dilettantes and some speculators
569,an unknown artist whose output suddenly becomes all the rage is a money tree not to mention the tax deductions accumulated by his patrons when his art is donated to a museum at highly inflated values
570,as to more mundane levels of communication such as speech it is easier to speak to a small crowd than a large one easier to speak to people like yourself than to foreigners
571,men and women who speak the same language do not have to have their words intenupted by passing them through the filter of translation
572,those who live in a state populated by their own kind are not bombarded by the confusing and often contradic­ tory messages that are the lingua franca of multiracial states
573,the inhabitants of an ethnostate are much less apt to be assaulted or outraged by art foisted upon them by racial and cultural oddballs motivated to alienate rather than to please the artistic sensibilities of the host population
574,art flourishes when it both reaches up and reaches down
575,it is a collective enterprise in which the artists mission is to satisfy and fulfill his peoples artistic needs
576,the biological link reinforces the artistic urge and raises it to a higher plane than could be attained by a writer painter or composer work­ ing in an alien environment in complete isolation from his people
577,artificial fame and substantial financial rewards may indicate that someone is an artist but in the long run it is his art and his art alone which gives him authenticity
578,his own people and no other peoplenot himself not his publicist no alien or androgynous criticwill be the final judge
579,when his own people do not understand him no one will
580,lack of 38 the ethnostate understanding and incomprehension on the part of his nat­ ural audience transforms what the artist conceives to be art into nonart
581,if the athenian population in the 5th century bc
582,had not resonated to the plays of sophocles there would have been no sophocles or at least the greeks and those who came after them would never have attended a sophoclean play
583,today the level of public understanding is so low the artistic sensibilities of the public so stunted that about all that is left of drama is its lowest common denominator the commercial­ loaded television sitcom
584,like a telephone conversation art is a twoway communication
585,when the line is cut there is no con­ nection
586,the ethnostate will give art a lift by providing it with a homogeneous audience
587,the artist will now know with whom he is dealing
588,he will no longer have to dilute vulgarize sim­ plify or sensationalize his work to make it more intelligible and palatable to a culturally and racially diverse audience
589,the ethnostate will give him true artistic freedom since he will escape the censorship that suffocates creativity in a multiracial state where the artist is at the mercy of an army of differently attuned critics ready and eager to pounce on him for lacking sensitivity towards one or another population group and ready and eager to denounce him for the slightest mani­ festation of his own ethnic pride
590,these same critics it might be added are usually quite supportive of ethnic pride pro­ vided it is restricted to their own population group
591,the art that counts is the art that gives people a spirited and spiritual boost
592,in a multiracial pluralistic state art is reduced to meaningless papever larger doses of obscenity in plays and literature whose purpose is to· shock not uplift ever louder drumbeats in music and ever more tasteless daubs on canvas
593,modem artists often appear to be more interested in posing and posturing as artists than in art itself
594,they seem locked into the habit of encumbering their painting sculpture music and literature with excerpts from political statements and campaign speeches
595,some of the richest most successful and the ethnostate 39 most influential of these artists may actually lack a genetic capacity for art
596,jewish artists are descended from a people whose orthodox sects have observed millenniaold religious strictures against graven images
597,those other semites the arabs have compensated for their religiously ordained prohibition against painting the human figure by developing graceful and artistic lettering and some beautiful architecture
598,in addition to the era of high art in ancient greece there were moments in renaissance florence elizabethan england and goethes weimar when the artistic tastes of the cultivated classes and the people were almost in tune when theater audiences were on an equal footing of cultural sophistication with the playwright
599,such rare explosions of genius may provide a foretaste of the high art that should emerge from ethnostates
600,in multiracial states art especially popular art inevitably becomes regionalized
601,the most important american painters in the 20th century are the midwest regionalists grant wood thomas benton and edward hopper
602,the most listened to music was and is the country music of the south the hit tunes of broadway and hollywood and the negro jazz that origin­ ated in the saloons of new orleans memphis and chicago
603,the most significant literature was produced in the south william faulkner and thomas wolfe and the midwest ernest hemingway and f scott fitzgerald
604,art in america no longer springs from the country at large and from the people at large
605,for want of a better definition art is subtlety
606,it is not a proper medium for propaganda
607,today westerners are often forced to adopt a form of reverse racism as a defense against artists who skillfully mount racist attacks against them
608,everyone is so obsessed with racism these days there is little time for anything else least of all art unless the art directly serves a racial agenda
609,times of change are marked by the dying and birthing of races and cultures
610,dying is often one long process of spiritual and bodily degeneration which translates into degenerate art
611,birthing is a synonym for immaturity inexperience and lack 40 the ethnostate of control
612,but whereas the youngster grows into an adult the oldster looks only towards the grave
613,out of the warm self­ centeredness of young civilizations can evolve the cool assur­ ance sophistication depth and control that are the building blocks of high culture
614,if one or more of the wests minorities should prove to be the inheritors of the future no genuine art will emerge until they free themselves from the cultural legacies of the majori­ ties they have overcome
615,miscegenation with the remnants of once dominant majorities will simply speed up the minorities own degeneration
616,history proves again and again that high art is the product of homogeneity
617,when heterogeneous elements flow in to partake of the material comforts of the high civiliza­ tion that go hand in hand with high culture the art curve slopes downward
618,art critic joseph wood krutch has written the only dan­ gerous threat to an established morality is a new morality
619,he is both right and wrong
620,an alien morality imposed on a de­ clining native morality may produce a hybrid morality that degenerates into immorality
621,without morality art quickly de­ cends into pornography
622,one of popular arts most nagging questions is how far can it be divorced from reality
623,in late 20thcentury art role re­ versal has almost become an inviolable rule
624,negroes commit crimes hugely disproportionate to their numbers but in order not to exacerbate racial feelings and in an effort to blur the gruesome statistics of black crime films and plays constantly feature black good guys and white bad guys
625,in tv sit­ coms producers and writers go out of their way to have the negro gradeschool student who in realufe has a lamentable scholastic record answer a teachers question correctly almost before the white student can raise his hand
626,the psychological effect of this deception on white students is difficult to assess
627,one thing is certain
628,at an early age white children are subject to a barrage of songs cartoons and tv shows about race which they soon learn from firsthand experience to be false
629,to know that popular art is a medium for deception creates sus­ picions about all art even great art
630,the ethnostate 41 forced acculturation
631,though military aggression is the most serious fonn of foreign interference into matters of state cultural aggression comes in a close second
632,adverse reactions are to be expected whenever and wherever any population group is persuaded or forced to adopt the customs and man­ ners of another population group by economic and political pressure or by some otherintrusive means such as being co­ opted into the population of the aggressor by marriage or less lawful fonns of interbreeding
633,despite all the approval lavished these days on the notion of cultural diffusion what really happens to an indigenous culture under attack is similar to what an individual exposed to a diseasecarrying virus under­ goes
634,aside from preventing people from living according to their predilections cultural aggression brings in its wake other more subtle and less apparent evils
635,different population groups have varied aesthetic and psychological tolerances
636,who would deny that jazz has not made unhealthy inroads in cultures whose music particularly folk music differs so radically from that of the negro
637,in earlier times when the tables were turned were not the musical talents of slaves distorted when they heard the unsyncopated rhythms and melodies of their southern masters
638,for centuries western culture has had an almost irre­ sistible attraction for asians and black africans
639,tens if not hundreds of millions of nonwhites have adopted western ways to the disdain and despair of other hundreds of millions of their kin who have remained loyal to their native customs
640,cultural aggression which may precede or follow military aggression fills the great reservoir of human disagreement to overflowing
641,it would be greatly curbed if not eliminated in a world of ethnostates since each separate population group would be encouraged indeed practically compelled to keep its culture at home
642,every ethnostates culture would be self­ embargoed and labeled not for export
643,the cultures of some population groups depending on the time and place are often too delicate to endure too many severe shocks either external or internal
644,conversely some cultures are often tough enough to outlast military occupation 42 the ethnostate and long periods of persecution by what would seem to be more dynamic cultures
645,perhaps the second worst crime in mankinds book after genocide is culturecide
646,in the presentday west crime job­ lessness and economic jolts are less dangerous and threat­ ening than the counterculture of drugs homosexuality heavy metal cacophony decadent liberalism pornography and mi­ nority paranoiaa counterculture that is not seeking to modify or change the culture it is attacking but to erase it
647,countercultures are quasicultures
648,at bottom they are anar­ chistic and destructive reactions to the discipline responsibility and concentrated effort needed to keep any culture viable
649,although it is often a severe mental and physical strain for people of rudimentary cultures to live up to the standards of high cultures it is just as much of a task for the possessors of highly articulated cultures to defend their precious possession against the incessant assaults of countercultures
650,members of the same race have little difficulty adapting to the different cultures of other members since race is an important determinant of culture and the cultures developed by members of the same race are not all that disparate
651,non­ englishspeaking northern europeans easily and quickly adapted to the anglosaxon core culture of australia new zealand british canada and the united states
652,to evolve culture needs constant challenges but they should come from within not from without
653,a culture tom and fraz­ zled by interracial conflicts is hobbled by the amount of energy it must waste asserting and proving its own worth and uniqueness
654,only a culture that is sure of itself that has the freedom and resources to work towards perfecting itself with­ out excessive internal and external interference can attain the heights to which it aspires
655,when asking about a particular cul­ ture a better question than where it comes from is where it is going
656,one of the great problems of culture is how to preserve it without petrifying it
657,aesthetics
658,if there are absolute standards of beauty then some races or population groups because they have a greater the ethnostate 43 concentration of the physical traits that conform to these stan­ dards would have to be judged more attractive than others
659,in a multiracial state this preponderance of attractiveness in the genetic makeup of one or more groups is a constant thorn in the side of those who possess fewer of these premium traits
660,over time aesthetically ruffled feelings do little for political and social harmony
661,by keeping different racial and ethnic groups geographi­ cally apart the envy and animosity engendered in the popula­ tion groups considered less attractive will be sharply reduced if not altogether eliminated
662,living entirely with their own kind the citizens of ethnostates will not be reminded on a daily basis of their alsoran status in world beauty pageants
663,nor will tv commercials newspaper ads and billboard posters overawe them with the faces and physiques of members of more hand­ some population groups
664,if beauty standards are not absolute if they are determined by the dominant population group in any society as marxists and equalitarians tell us racial separation provides a better so­ lution to the problem than waiting for a jealous subject race to rise up overpower the ruling establishment and set its own standards of beauty
665,the quick way out of such an aesthetic impasse is to have population groups define their own ideals of beauty without the interference and presence of other groups
666,physical attrac­ tiveness would be measured by internal comparisons not by invidious comparisons with other races
667,there is some truth to the equation that art plus genetics equals aesthetics
668,art is a transcendent experience fixed in paint stone words and musical notes
669,when christ was painted sculpted or otherwise described as a middle easterner chris­ tianity had difficulty catching fire in northern european hearts
670,to conform to the nordic view of christianity even lucifer was often depicted with a fair complexion
671,how else could he have so successfully tempted people with light hair light skin and light eyes
672,ugliness in the eye of the beholder does not tempt
673,in a world of ethnostates let the racial stereotypes flourish 44 the ethnostate but let them be restricted to the homogeneous population groups of each ethnostate and not flow across borders where they proceed to stir up the racial mischief that has been so damaging to multiracial states
674,cultural diversity contains an aesthetic component that may have a profound effect on the collective subconscious
675,con­ sider the united states
676,a century and a half ago it was divided into fairly welldefined regions the deep south the dry semi­ desert cattlebreeding southwest puritan new england the farm country of the midwest
677,today dubuque is scarcely dif­ ferent from orlando portland oregon from portland maine
678,the same billboards shopping malls tv programs gasoline stations and fast food restaurants are omnipresent in modem americas 3618770 square miles of dreary sameness
679,by a twin process of concentration and isolation ethnostates would first resist then reverse this lemminglike rush to overall conformity
680,the all but extinct regionalism of america would be reborn and refurbished as would the provinces of europe though many of the latter still retain remnants of their original character
681,of the notable cultural benefits the ethnostate would bestow on mankind perhaps the greatest would accrue to the eye which would light up when by merely crossing the nearest frontier the traveler comes face to face with a different way of life a distinct set of customs a different art and architecture
682,tourism which has now deteriorated into driving or flying from sameness to sameness would revert to its higher purpose inspiring the serious traveler to learn more about himself by comparing his ways to the ways of strangers
683,at the same time tourism for the sake of tourism purely for the sake of travel­ ing should be limited
684,too many such tourists tend to destroy the uniqueness of the places they visit
685,too many cultural intruders distort native cultures
686,for this reason ethnostatists while developing a modem and efficient domestic transport­ ation network should not go overboard in promoting foreign travel and should do what they can to protect other ethnostates as well as their own from mass incursions of sightseeing philistines
687,in the words of robert frost who borrowed with the ethnostate 45 acknowledgment an aphorism that appeared in an 1850 south carolina almanac
688,good· fences make good neighbors
689,chapter 3 diversity contra pluralism those who preach diversity and pluralism in the same breath may think they are playing around with synonyms but they are really mixing oil and water
690,a motley mass of diverse pop­ ulation groups stirred together in an urban or suburban stew inevitably leads to miscegenation which in tum leads to bio­ logical and cultural confonnity and similarity not diversity
691,a world divided into ethnostates all showing a decent respect for each others distinctiveness by establishing wellmarked geo­ graphical and wellunderstood racial and cultural boundaries is the best bet for preserving and actually increasing diversity for the cogent reason that it militates against the one certain means of ending diversity namely interbreeding and cross­ culturation
692,notwithstanding what is being said or written by politicians and editorial writers pluralism which is dedicated to sheltering within its confines a wide variety of races and cultures can only mean the revival of the outmoded idea of the american melting pot the pot that never has and never will melt its nonwhite components
693,pluralism has now reached scriptural status in the west
694,diversity in the context of pluralism has also become a polit­ ical and social commandment
695,yet in the long run pluralism leads away from rather than to diversity
696,this conceptual con­ fusion offers ethnostatists a rare chance to make an effective inroad into one of the most deeply held and most cherished liberal beliefs
697,by demonstrating their sincere adherence to the 46 the ethnostate 47 principle of diversity and carefully explaining that true plural­ ism can only be achieved outside not inside the melting pot ethnostatists if they play their cards correctly can tap into some of the vast media resources ever at the disposal of liber­ alism
698,once it is made plain that pluralism as presently conceived and practiced can only result in undifferentiated uniformity a major prop of the established political theology will be severe­ ly shaken
699,just as aids is a constant reminder of the deadly contradictions in the homosexual way of life so pluralism can be presented to its adherents as an antonym rather than a syn­ onym of genuine diversity
700,pluralism it should also be pointed out is not necessarily synonymous with multiracism
701,religious pluralism is a stand­ ing threat to social stability even in a mono racial state
702,serious and profound disputes have arisen wherever two or more faiths have existed side by side
703,some religious wars have been more violent and destructive than racial or class conflicts though tenuous correlations between religion and class and between religion and race can generally be found
704,political and eco­ nomic pluralism which divides people into classes lays the groundwork for revolutions by the less affluent and for counterrevolutions by the more affluent
705,headcounting
706,a pluralistic state has the tendency to be­ come an arena of competing birthrates
707,since the richer ele­ ments of the population usually produce fewer children than the poorer elements the latter will eventually outnumber the former at which point they begin to challenge the dominant groups leadership
708,the challenge if successful will frequent­ ly be accompanied by the persecution purges and possibly even the liquidation of what was once the ruling elite
709,one negative means of avoiding these pitfalls is intermarriage which though it may temporarily suppress violence dilutes and distorts the cultures of all population groupscultures which would thrive in the fertile and protective soil of an ethnostate
710,competitive breeding in an ethnostate is not the problem it is 48 the ethnostate in pluralistic societies
711,homogeneity eliminates a principal cause of interracial baby derbiesthe racial minorities urge for empowerment
712,disparate birthrates also affect foreign rela­ tions
713,a state with an exploding population and an eye on a less populated neighboring state may decide it needs more territory
714,it may also decide its bigger pool of manpower will ensure an easy victory in an aggressive war
715,this is where international or regional mediation committees should enter the picture
716,as stated previously in this study the chief purpose of international bodies should be to keep states from attempting to dominate other states
717,competitive breeding is one means perhaps the most destructive means of disrupting the peace and stability of countries with low birthrates
718,when a high birthrate is a desideratum of government policy in a country that is already overpopulated it is the responsibil­ ity of professional thirdparty mediators to ensure that the increased numbers do not lead to cultural imperialism or other forms of aggression
719,at present this problem is disap­ pearing in most industrial nations because fewer and fewer white women want more than two children and tens of millions are satisfied with one
720,the twoincome family puts too much of a work load on mothers for them to engage in long bouts of childbearing
721,but masses of immigrants legal and illegal from third world countries and the large families favored by unassimilable minorities already domiciled in the west con­ tinue to remind westerners of not only the political and economic but also the cultural dangers posed by high non­ white birthrates
722,unfortunately there will always be some white couples who for religious reasons or out of sheer ignorance will continue to bring more children than they should into an already over­ crowded world
723,if persuasion will not stop their reckless breeding then some type of sanctions must be invoked and some form of enforced birth control initiated
724,whatever else is done these irresponsible childbearers should be given a crash course in demographics a discipline which has evolved in recent decades from a littleknown esoteric form of head­ counting to a fullblown respectable science that holds a the ethnostate 49 master key to human progress
725,rethinking pluralism
726,domestic pandering to different ethnic groups at home inescapably panders to their relatives overseas and results in a porous immigration policy
727,altruism liberalism equalitarianism minority racism and other modem shibboleths permit the entry of large numbers of foreigners many of whom are incapable of assimilation
728,consequently the racial composition of the population of the united states and of many western countries is forever changing
729,it is no surprise that when the racial and cultural mix of the popula­ tion changes the country changes
730,with the changes come all the problems that multiracialism loads on the social order
731,the 20th centurys most pluralistic state was the soviet union the worlds largest country in respect to land mass with a huge variegated population ranging from moslem mongol­ oids in central asia to nordics in the baltic states from slavic alpines in russia proper to eastern mediterranean georgians and armenians in the caucausus
732,such a potpourri of people could only be held together by force
733,in the late 1980s when the ussr gave up its satellite states in eastern europe and when president gorbachev triggered the chain reaction of devolution within the soviet union the soviet empire dis­ integrated
734,the centrifuge inherent in pluralism went into overdrive
735,unlike the late ussr america is not neatly divided into distinct geographical partitions each with centuries of racial and cultural homogeneity acting as a hairtrigger for separ­ atism
736,the south the one region that did break away and achieve separate nationhood for a few years bears a few simil­ arities to a european province but the republican and demo­ cratic parties will strongly oppose and suppress any meaning­ ful movement towards white separatism even as racial and cultural borders in the hispanic southwest and in the inner cities are hardening
737,while nonwhite minorities slowly solidify their separatist yearnings the white majorityforbidden to practice apartness and in spite of its many internal divisions and ideological schisms still the racial and cultural core of the 50 the ethnostate countrywill have ever greater difficulty holding everything together
738,partly to counter the antiassimilationist trends of nonwhite minorities the american government has resorted to bribery in the fono of affinoative action and racial preference programs measures which obviously anger most whites
739,when the brib­ ery becomes so costly and so racially divisive as to provoke widespread public disorder laws will probably be passed to prohibit open debate on the issue which will increase rather than decrease the desire of some white population groups to quit the union and go it on their own
740,to the consternation of a majority of supreme court justices laws of this type pur­ portedly targeted on hate crimes already exist in several american states
741,problems of diversity
742,there are several schools of thought about diversity
743,one school believes the promotion of cultural diversity bestows more power and freedom on minorities by encouraging them to resist the cultural dominance of major­ ities
744,another school insists that integration of any kind­ political economic social or culturaldegrades the character and morale of the minority groups caught up in the accul­ turation process
745,consisting mainly of jews still another school more accurately an organized network preaches diver­ sity in the belief that it serves as a protective shield in what at any time could tum into a hostile antisemitic environment
746,although jews prefer to attach themselves to the host culture as they seek to modify and shape it to their own tastes and requirements these networkers stridently promote cultural diversity not because they think it right but because it serves their own ends
747,history has taught them that a pluralistic state has room and breathing space for various ethnic groups while a monocultural state except for occasional outbursts of altru­ ism from its intellectuals will barely tolerate the presence of outsiders unless they are willing to accept secondclass citi­ zenship
748,the networkers have also learned that homogeneous societies are dubious about those who have no readily iden­ tifiable culture of their own beyond ties to an oldstyle religion the ethnostate 51 and a heavily doctored history
749,these doubts multiply as the networkers step up their tinkering with the host culture
750,only in surroundings compatible with their genes can hu­ mans fully concentrate on ascending to the higher reaches of culture
751,without appropriate frames even the greatest paint­ ings lose some of their luster and beauty
752,it is no secret that flowers grow more colorfully and luxuriantly in their native soil
753,family neighborhood and community combine with genet­ ics and learned behavior to form the human personality
754,sheer survival is possible without most of the standard environ­ mental props as hermits loners and recluses have proved throughout history
755,but the individual who has voluntarily given up normal associations with his family and fellow humans is not an ordinary individual
756,the person who skips haphazardly from place to place like a tumbleweed in the desert wind who feels no loyalty to anyone or anything is more often than not a troubled soul one who in the long term receives much more from the society he abhors or flees than he gives in return
757,he is hardly the type to make any important contributions to human progress
758,diversity within a state expands the quantity of culture but lowers its quality
759,multiracial nations suffer from cultural deprivation because the arts fall into the hands of people of many different origins
760,diverse cultural and racial back­ grounds carry a heavy baggage of disparate and disjunctive predispositions and prejudices
761,how much racial division how much social antagonism can a nation tolerate and still remain a nation
762,the past tells us that disorganized majorities can be brought to heel by intelligent willful minorities
763,every creative society has had a core popul­ ation group with enough power and prestige to make its way of life the cultural model for later arrivals of different back­ grounds
764,such a society must be united and strong enough to withstand the political and cultural competition that is bound to arise as soon as the newcomers get settled and begin to flex their political and economic muscles
765,an instinctive group protectiveness in the founders and their descendants will 52 the ethnostate oppose and try to delay any attempt at cultural accom­ modation and compromise
766,even snobbism and prejudice be­ come partially effective defensive weapons against cultural transformation
767,in declining cultures however snobbism favors what is alien or decadent and prejudice is defined as the worst of evils
768,an ethnostate because of its monoracial and monocultural structure will avoid the dangers of submitting its population to the forced acculturation that often accompanies civil strife
769,a kulturkamp is always possible as it is in every state since class differences will always be there to fuel it
770,but the most dangerous fuelracial frictionwill be absent
771,experience teaches us that the most significant and most enduring cultural reforms are those urged by reformers on their own people
772,in theory pluralistic nations permit their variegated popula­ tion groups to cling to their native cultures
773,in a contradictory theory and in the poetry of emma lazarus the united states offered the worlds oppressed a haven where they would dissolve in a racial and cultural amalgam that would eradicate human differences
774,the melting pot as this wild idea was later called by another spurious jewish equalitarian israel zangwill was partially successful as· long as its ingredients were white europeans
775,it failed and continues to fail when nonwhites are thrown into the pot
776,why do multiculturalists oppose a world of diverse states a world that would cultivate diversity not within states which is pluralism but in the form of independent ethnostates dedi­ cated to the augmentation of diversity
777,first it should be noted that these naysayers are the same people who in multiracial states support minority racism but are horrified at the slightest manifestation of ethnicity on the part of majorities
778,their opposition to the ethnostate concept is probably based on an extension of the same reasoning
779,they are fearful of majorities and do not wish to give them too much opportunity to engage in serious majoritarian politics
780,they also know that without the white majorities and with only minorities at the helm western multiracial states would soon become third world states thereby depriving them of the security and material the ethnostate 53 comforts which make the industrial nations so attractive
781,what it boils down to is that one group of diversifiers lobbies for diversification not so much for diversification itself but to strengthen the power of minorities visavis majorities
782,the other group of diversifiers potential ethnostatists
783,advocates interstate rather than intrastate diversification
784,their aim is to preserve and strengthen the cultures of all population groups by letting them have their own states where they can follow their own ways and drop the minority status which dogs them in multiracial nations
785,chapter 4 the morale factor if selfrespect is a vital element of a successful and pro­ ductive life so is group respect
786,what is not generally under­ stood is the difficulty of having the fonner without the latter
787,it is equally difficult for an individual to have selfrespect if he is a member of a disrespected group
788,the psychology works both ways
789,if the group is not respected the selfrespect of its members is lowered
790,at the same time there can be little or no group respect if its members lack selfrespect
791,since ethnostates are concerned with the collectivity of their citizens as well as their individuality both selfrespect and group respect are nurtured
792,in large multicultural multiracial nations where individuals are cast adrift in a turbulent demo­ graphic sea group respect is hard to come by
793,group compe­ tition though often frowned upon constantly reminds large segments of the population of their inferior performance in classrooms and later in their careers
794,nonmembers of groups being unable to bathe in the glow of group esteem ever in­ creasing numbers of isolates in western countries suffer from a shortage of selfrespect
795,the inherent lonerism of so many westerners adds greatly to this flight from the group as does the medias incessant campaign against group manifes­ tations of majorities while similar minority manifestations are applauded
796,selfrespect and group respect two of the most important psychological fits for a productive and meaningful life 54 the ethnostate 55 should be easier to acquire in an ethnostate than elsewhere
797,political scientists might keep this in mind as might those utopians who are busy designing universal states
798,let us suppose that a college football team from the day it starts training to the last game of the season never hears a word of praise from the coach the faculty the student body and sports writers
799,let us also suppose that the team members are attacked both as members of a group and as individuals day in and day out on the playing field in the classroom and in the media
800,let us further suppose every opposing team on the football schedule is praised just as highly as the home team is criticized
801,in such circumstances it will be a very exceptional home team that manages to win a single game
802,population groups need morale as much as teams do
803,if you are not permitted to utter or hear one good word about your own people then no matter how great your capabilities you will be hard put to overcome the mental and physical paralysis imposed by demoralization
804,it goes without saying that people will conquer adversity much more effectively if their will and spirit are fortified by group morale
805,how do majorities fight demoralization
806,blacking out the media is one answer
807,missing the nightly news is in itself a morale booster
808,what is good for majorities is what seldom happens
809,for reading we should tum to books that were written by westerners when they were still masters in their own house and were treated with more deference than scorn
810,our know­ ledge of current historyand our current predicamentmust not be fed to us by minoritywritten or minorityinfluenced bestsellers and by liberalminority intellectuals
811,our under­ standing of the world should be derived from the books and pamphlets printed and distributed surreptitiously to escape the censorious scissors and legal harassment of the thought police
812,the world of ethnostates will be a world of majorities since no state will have a minority
813,minority members no longer having real or imagined racism to blame for their real or imagined problems will as majority members be able to con­ centrate on themselves and their own accomplishments actual or potential
814,it will be remarkable how quickly scapegoats will s6 the ethnostate disappear when the racism that haunts multiracial states dis­ appears
815,a case for optimism
816,pessimism is a vital ingredient of tragedy which is the highest form of drama and the dominant theme in great literature art and music
817,no optimist could possibly have created characters like oedipus lear and faust
818,still optimism is a major force for great deeds in the real world
819,few will struggle to perform heroic feats unless they feel that the world their country their community their family or themselves will be the better for it
820,the authentic hero is driven by more than ambition and egotism
821,today far too many of us are in a pessimistic sterile mood
822,to overcome this negative state of mind we should devote more of our thoughts to the mysterious subject of time
823,every decade or so geologists tell us that the earth is much older than previously suspected
824,when we recall that archbishop usshers 4004 bc
825,date for the creation was widely believed a few centuries ago the latest estimate of eight billion years for the earths age is quite a backward leap in chronology
826,since the various species of man rate a barely visible notch on this scale the time span of civilized or civilizable man is almost imper­ ceptible
827,if only 50000 years or so were needed to move up to isaac newton from homo neanderthalis the imagination reels at what might be accomplished in the billions of years that barring some cosmic catastrophe still remain on our evo­ lutionary clock
828,accordingly we have good reason to give credence to the most optimistic of optimistic cliches the skys the limit
829,no matter how many setbacks man faces he still has more than enough timehundreds of millions if not billions of yearsto rectify the cruelest mistakes and over­ come the worst setbacks of his earthly existence
830,this does not mean that modem man should rely on time alone to save him from himself
831,as an individual as a living being at the mercy of a fastticking biological clock he must act quickly or not at all
832,if he does nothing or not enough and drags the world under with him his only hope is that given enough time what has happened once may happen again that the west in some the ethnostate 57 faroff millennium will rise once again that nietzsches eter­ nal return in this case shortened to a billion years or so may come to the rescue
833,there is even a soupon of immortality in such lavish helpings of time
834,but none of these otherworldly panaceas can compete with the high expectations inherent in the religious promise of life after death
835,if evolution made the jump from ape to man in 12 million yearsno more than a grain of sand in the geological hour­ glassthen every human being on earth could perish tomor­ row and other primates would still have hundreds of oppor­ tunities hundreds of 12millionyear cycles to get back on the evolutionary track and reevolve into man
836,the mutations that once operated so successfully on primates would have almost unlimited opportunities to repeat the process
837,shortterm pessimism and longterm optimism would appear to be the proper combination of moods for contemporary western man
838,the westerners who are obsessed with the dis­ maying dysgeny of the modem world and refuse to consider the time factor and its restorative powers are simply not being realistic
839,there is a mountain of optimism out there for people who take the long view
840,men and women of european descent who note the decline in their numbers have a right to worry about the future since numerically most other peoples are either holding their own or increasing
841,but even here there is room for optimism
842,accept­ ing 800 million as the current world population of europeans either in their original homelands or overseas this figure is at least eight times higher than it was half a millennium ago
843,if a race can octuple itself in five centuries and reduce its size by half in three or four generations as now looks to be the case the least that can be said about it is that it has a very flexible birthrate
844,such flexibility might enable it to reverse its present decline by increasing its current fertility rate by only 30
845,europeans seem to go through cycles of massive energy outputsthe dorian invasion of greece the folk wanderings that ended the roman empire the settlement of north amer­ ica and australasia the overrunning of africa and consider­ able parts of asia
846,who can say that we have seen the last of 58 the ethnostate such racial dynamism
847,but if it is to recur let all the energy be directed inward towards the conquest of the mind not the conquest of territory towards genetic engineering and space exploration not more affirmative action legislation
848,albert j nock the wise old american political philosopher once tried to boost the morale of serious reformers not the professional dogooders and worldsavers by citing isaiah 1 9 who referred to a very small remnant of good people in the world
849,few of us ever meet them
850,few of us ever know who they are or how many of them exist
851,but they are there and they are always ready to help restore a sick people to health just as in ancient times according to the old testament the hebrew remnant rebuilt their ravaged and scorched promised land
852,nocks panglossian view is a tonic to depress­ ed members of white majorities
853,but it is hardly enough for the people who want immediate and tangible results from their labors
854,a more effective and enduring way to lift spirits might go like this im right so i will go ahead come what may
855,if no one listens so what
856,i would do what im doing even if i knew that my people were finished and didnt have a chance of a comeback
857,yes my ship of state my west may be going down but if she goes im going to make sure that at least one mem­ ber of the crew is still hoisting sail as she sinks
858,say to yourself if you must that you are a prisoner of destiny that you have little or no choice
859,but also say that since you are locked into the struggle you may as well make the best of it
860,is it sensible to feel pessimistic about events and situations because you like to think they are beyond your control
861,you had better think again or they will be beyond your control
862,we all know what usually occurs when different types of ani­ mals are locked up in the same cage
863,yet our presidents and legislators confused and pressured by voting blocs and special interest groups continue to do what no zookeeper would think of doing to animalsconfining different breeds of humans in the human zoos of the big cities
864,if this dangerous practice is not stoppedand the ethnostate would be a most effective way to stop itthen the entire west may become a killing field
865,the ethnostate 59 altruism at work
866,the generation of the 1960s was called the me generation
867,since in many respects it has acted more altruistically than egotistically its members could just as accurately be described as the they generationmeaning that they have put others first and themselves second
868,we have only to recall the immense amount of foreign aid that is con­ tinually lavished by practically all western nations on the underdeveloped countries and on nations with foreign policies hostile to the donors
869,it is the altruistic instinct of westerners that makes these financial outpouring possible though min­ ority pressures and media disinformation help it along
870,the golden mean has always been an honored western ethic
871,but there is no word in english for the national or in­ deed the personal behavior that lies midway between egotism and altruism no middle ground between me and them
872,apparently all peoples at one time or another are either inner­ directed egotistic chauvinistic or outerdirected altruistic charitable
873,the lack of a word for a behavioristic middle ground in the area of domestic and foreign politics demon­ strates that the golden mean despite its celebrity status has found no honorable place in the science of statecraft
874,the model altruistic state is america which calls itself a liberal democracy and which has developed a habit of going to war not only against but also for foreign countries and peoples while giving vast numbers of aliens millions of whom enter the country unlawfully the rights and privileges of citi­ zenship after only a few years residence
875,the families of the legal and illegal immigrants soon join them thereby over­ loading the welfare roles and reducing the amount of financial aid available to the nations own needy
876,is there any western nation that stands even close to the dividing line between egotism and altruism that puts its own interests first but does not allow either the egotism or altruism of its leaders to run riot
877,has any large nation or superpower learned that international meddling even international giving often leads not only to foreign but to domestic conflicts and confrontations
878,the ethnostate would appear to be one means of bringing the eternal egotisticaltruistic pendulum to rest
879,chapter 5 enlightened foreign policy proponents of globalism believe the best hope of mankind is a world government to supersede all other governments one that would establish and institutionalize one political legal and economic system for all mankind
880,whatever human differ­ ences exist would be treated as inconsequential
881,with a little carrotandstick shepherding the entire world would become one community
882,it is a noble concept although it tends to ignore that all pre­ vious attempts at international or world government have hard­ ly been successful
883,the league of nations which seemed to stir up rather than diminish conflicts gave up the ghost at the outbreak of world war ii
884,the peacekeeping record of the united nations is not much better witness the bloodbaths in korea vietnam cambodia tibet afghanistan and the middle east
885,the united nations only entered the korean war because the soviet member of the security council happened to be absent and could not cast his usual veto
886,soviet vetoes stymied practically every effort at collective action against communist and procommunist aggressors just as american vetoes and opposition stymied united nations attempts to curb israels persecution and dispossession of the palestinians
887,the united nations tried to remove saddam hussein from kuwait by peaceful means but president bush wanted war and he got his way
888,one way of ending family bickering is for contentious mem 60 the ethnostate 61 bers to move out and live apart
889,the same advice holds true for the family of nations
890,corralling many or all of the earths peoples into a world government may furnish them a stage instead of a battlefield to air their disputes
891,but it seldom settles them
892,keeping popu­ lation groups apart and separate sharply diminishes the pos­ sibility for disputes to arise
893,the safest guarantee of world order is to do what referees do in boxing matches
894,whenever they want to stop the slugging they separate the fighters
895,there are of course some situations and problems that de­ mand international or regional control and regulationamong them overpopulation and matters affecting the environment
896,but regional continental or global bodies that try to interfere with the purely domestic issues of a country often do more harm than good
897,different cultures have different moral standards
898,as long as these standards are not extended by force or undue persuasion beyond the borders of the state that is home to them they should not be a cause of concern to other states
899,universal empires are seedbeds of violence because they bring different peoples together and often force them to aban­ don their own habits and customs and mimic the behavior of their new masters
900,this form of oppression even when con­ ducted with velvet gloves instigates smoldering hatreds and feuds that are seldom extinguished until the alien yoke­ military economic or culturalis removed
901,globalists consciously or subconsciously aim at the reduc­ tion of all mankind to a common denominator thereby direct­ ly or indirectly pressuring billions of people to confonn to ways of life that are not their own
902,in the long run this process may work to the detriment of the pressurizers
903,in order to keep things under control the rulers slowly adopt the behavior patterns of the ruled
904,so while the cultural imperial­ ism inherent in globalism reaches down to alter the culture of those at the bottom of the power curve the increasing presence of the latter reaches up to modify the universal culture of the one worlders
905,as a result the cultural evolution of every­ one is often slowed if not permanently disrupted
906,62 the ethnostate some of the more fanatic globalists are convinced that one constitution one set of laws and one matrix of values should apply to all
907,they admit there are cultural differences but warn that paying too much heed to them leads to the aban­ donment of humanistic norms
908,in one sense this arrogant attitude tends to reverse the old adage let those who desire peace prepare for war
909,the internationalists who only desire peace on their own terms are not averse to the use of force to achieve their goal even though flourishing and unique cul­ tures are destroyed in the process and the planetary mosaic may lose more of its dwindling tesserae
910,when outsiders force any population group to give up change or modify its mores the seeds of perpetual discord are sown
911,wars have been fought for a multitude of reasons one of the most important being the desire of people to conduct their own affairs to worship their own gods and walk in the ways of their fathers and forefathers
912,to deny these basic rights to any population group is tantamount to a direct assault on its members privacy which is often their most precious possession
913,but this is not to say that the word international will dis­ appear from the dictionary with the advent of worldwide devo­ lution
914,there will still be international organizations
915,what will be heard much less frequently are the words national and nationalism as the number of nations diminish
916,in contrast to the goal of the united nations however which is to keep the peace by bringing people together the chief purpose of future global bodies will be to guard the independence and sover­ eignty of ethnostates
917,ecology and environmental problems will demand various agreements between two or more states as will foreign trade which should be kept to a minimum not­ withstanding that ethnostates with limited resources will need help from abroad until they are able to put in place auton­ omous or semiautonomous economies
918,some ethnostates of course will always need certain minerals and agricultural pro­ ducts possessed by other ethnostates more favorably endowed by nature
919,the ethnostate 63 globalism no
920,unfortunately for both jews and nonjews jewish organizations will probably be in the forefront of opposition to what is being proposed in this book although israel or rather the vision of a future israel in the eyes of many zionists comes quite close to fitting the description of an ethnostate
921,so far the jewish state has depended and contin­ ues to depend on western mainly american and german financial aid for its survival
922,without the annual billions of dollars of public and private grants and loans the israelis relatively high standard of living would fall drastically
923,since ethnostates are against foreign aid in principle and since israel has a vital interest in delaying or preventing any development that might endanger the subsidies which are its economic lifeblood the zionist state would have to reshape its economy drastically before it could qualify for ethnostatehood
924,many foreign nations especially those with founded or unfounded fears of western cultural and financial imperialism would welcome the division of the west into ethnostates
925,the establishment of smaller political entities would tend to weaken western economic predominance by watering down the eco­ nomies of scale
926,latin american states would eagerly applaud what they would perceive as a dismemberment of gringoism
927,small western nations like belgium holland and the scan­ dinavian countries would be happy to see the big powers cut down to size by their division into smaller units
928,since most black african nations are synthetic political constructs sitting uneasily on top of centuriesold tribalism they might try to mimic rather than oppose the devolution of western economic powerhouses
929,one of the beneficial consequences of breaking up nations into ethnostates would be a healthy narrowing of what might be characterized as political vision
930,since they have no strong cultural core multicultural states
931,develop bloodless and ab­ stract philosophies of government
932,events that happen any­ where are often viewed in the same light as events that happen next door
933,few allowances are made for different behavior pat­ terns
934,if any state deviates from some arbitrary universal moral norm then its sinful deviations must be punished by a break in 64 the ethnostate diplomatic relations a hostile media campaign economic sanc­ tions even military measures
935,in contrast to small countries which encourage or should encourage their citizens to think small big countries encour­ age their citizens to think big to worry more about what is happening abroad than at home
936,the more attention large nations devote to other countries the less attention they will devote to their own problems
937,problemsolving should extend from the individual to the community not the other way around
938,jesus spelled it out quite nicely matthew 7 23 but most western politicians if they have not forgotten his words certainly do not heed them thou hypocrite first cast out the beam and mote of thine own eye
939,for a brilliant rundown on the dangers provoked by americas ideological fixation on foreign policy see the roots of the modern american empire and the tragedy of american diplomacy by william apperson williams
940,most if not all multiracial nations are populated by ethnic groups which have real or imagined genetic and cultural ties with majorities or minorities in other nations
941,these biological or psychological links can cause severe distortions in foreign policy
942,the population groups in one country want often demand and frequently get special treatment for the nations for whom they feel a special kinship
943,as a result the interest of the nation as a whole often takes second place to the interests of racial and cultural lobbies which secure special trade advantages and financial aid for the governments they favor while the nations they disfavor are punished with economic sanctions
944,in the worst case this racial and cultural lobbying can lead a multiracial nation into a senseless war
945,foreign policy disputes will be greatly reduced in ethno­ states since whatever lobbying influences are brought to bear will come from people of the same racial and cultural back­ ground
946,if citizens are asked to put their lives on the line it will not be to satisfy and mollify minorities and pressure groups
947,just as racial infighting will disappear in a monoracial state so it ought to disappear in the conduct of foreign affairs
948,there will of course always be differing attitudes towards the ethnostate 65 foreign policy in an ethnostate but they will be mostly con­ fined to differing ideas about political and economic systems much safer subjects than race
949,if racial motives are involved at least they will be directed towards shoring up the defenses of a racially and culturally related foreign state
950,in some ways world wars i and ii could be viewed as civil or intraracial wars members of northern european descent britons and most americans against other people of northern european de­ scent germans
951,the ethnostates accent on race will flag the internecine aspect of such conflicts and help to nip them in the bud
952,those who deny the existence of minority influence on the foreign policy of the united states might ask themselves this question would south africa have been targeted with eco­ nomic sanctions and would israel have received massive out­ pourings of american financial aid amounting in one form or another to more than 50 billion since the founding of the zionist state in 1948 if the united states had no negroes or jews
953,despite the american war of independence the war of 1812 and a few diplomatic sore points in the 19th century britain and the united states maintained a relationship that often approached cousinhood
954,today british leaders watching the changing racial makeup of america see this traditional relationship fading
955,this was made plain by british con­ servative party chairman norman tebbit when he announced that this demographic shift will inevitably drive the two countries apart
956,ill be sorry he said to see the united states becoming a less anglosaxon country a less european country
957,transforming america into a patchwork of ethnostates would probably reawaken feelings of kinship with britain and other northern european countries
958,at the same time black hispanic and asian ethnostates would strengthen their own ties with africa latin america and the orient respectively
959,an ethnostate or ethnostates composed of the descendants of southern europeans would intensify their racial and cultural links to italy spain or greece
960,there might even be an ethno 66 the ethnostate state for americans of eastern mediterranean and arab origin
961,instead of an oversized overextended overpopulated nation seething with ethnic groups of sharply divergent backgrounds all busy promoting their own particular foreign and domestic agendas a string of ethnostates would permit various popu­ lation groups to move in various political economic and social directions without domestic opposition from other groups moving in opposite directionsall for purely racial reasons
962,better to have separate states than separate racial groups within one state
963,the small mono racial state is free to follow its destiny without being hobbled by the internal racial dissension that wreaks havoc in multiracial states
964,governing a melting pot whose contents have never melted and are becoming more unmeltable with each passing day is a labor that even hercules would refuse to tackle
965,fear and distrust of foreigners and strangers is an inborn survival mechanism
966,it has its obvious positive points because it stimulates and strengthens group cohesion
967,but the same mechanism can be turned to the advantage of an aggressor who wants to stir up war fever against another state
968,sad to say one group of people can be persuaded to hate another group of people thousands of miles away even if the latter shares a lot of genes with the former
969,it is much easier however to develop an abiding hatred for strangers and aliens who move next door
970,empirebuilding is the opposite side of the coin of devo­ lution
971,aggressive and expansionist forces generally take over when a nation goes on the warpath
972,conversely when a nation becomes weak it poses much less of a threat to its neighbors
973,though the military aggression of one nation against an­ other should disappear with the nation states themselves it is inevitable that some ethnostates egged on by overly ambitious politicians will try to intimidate threaten and even assault their neighbors
974,to avoid this situation some higher authority must make it dramatically clear that a resort to force by any state ethnoor otherwise would provoke swift retaliation
975,the use of arms or armies by any ethnostate against another would be a stem global nono
976,merchants of death caught selling arms the ethnostate 67 to anyone will meet the same fate that their wares have reserved for millions of others
977,military aggression will not only go down in the law books as a high crime but a crime against the very concept of devolution
978,the ragnarok defense
979,an ethnostate relying solely on its own defense capabilities could hardly survive an assault by a wellarmed aggressive nation or group of nations
980,this would seem to be a reasonable statement until one asks three per­ tinent questions a is not a homogeneous fighting unit all else being equal better at combat than a heterogeneous one
981,b do not the people of a homogeneous state display greater loyalty to the state and a greater spirit of sacrifice than a motley disaffected racially mixed population that has little in common but citizenship papers
982,c is not a small monoracial state composed of a united technologically proficient people likely to wield as much military power as a huge sprawling internally divided multiracial behemoth
983,though it may sound more ominous than cynical the advent of nuclear weapons appears to have been purposely timed to usher in an era of ethnostates
984,today for perhaps the first time in history a small state has the ability to defend itself success­ fully against a powerful military assailant
985,all that is needed to immeasurably damage the aggressor is a few thermonuclear warheads mounted on missiles that can hit and demolish the enemys largest cities
986,obviously the small state with its mea­ ger stock of nuclear weapons would suffer much more dam­ age than its adversary
987,the odds are it would be all but oblit­ erated
988,as for the aggressor state the most it could hope for in the way of victory would be that the loss of two or three of its largest cities and millions of its population would not have a crippling and irreparable effect on its status as a great power
989,faced with such a bleak prospect no such nation is likely to start a war that would end in defeat for winner and loser alike
990,many defensive treaties would surely be enacted when ethnostates finally take shape both in the new world and the old
991,several of the ethnostates carved out of the united states would share long stretches of frontiers
992,the proximity of some 68 the ethnostate of these states and their racial and cultural links would make effective defensive alliances relatively easy to organize
993,what is more some of these ethnostates will either inherit a nuclear arsenal or have the technology to develop nuclear weapons in quantities and destructive power sufficient to give any potential aggressor second thoughts
994,since it would be in the interest of these ethnostates to prevent any foreign power from meddling in new world affairs there is no reason why the monroe doctrine could not be revived by extending a nuclear umbrella over both north and south america
995,poorer and weaker eth­ no states in the western hemisphere should welcome this pro­ tection
996,in europe any expansionist nation would be warned by a network of ethnostates that the slightest aggressive move would be met by a hail of nucleartipped missiles
997,the two atomic bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki made it plain that any nation that still clings blindly to notions of traditional warfare would be faced with an enormous strategic disadvan­ tage
998,every ethnostate must provide for its survival in the event of a nuclear conflict by constructing sufficient shelters and facilities so that when the devastation is over enough citizens will have survived to rebuild the shattered infrastructure
999,mem­ bers of every ethnic group must have drummed into them that they and their culture must not be allowed to die
1000,whole cities can be buried underground or tunneled into mountains
1001,fro­ zen sperm and ova willlastjor years if not centuries
1002,only the spirit of defeat will bring about defeat
1003,only belief in the possibility of total destruction will make total destruction pos­ sible
1004,war deterrent
1005,skeptics of this study have a right to ask if ethnostates while ending many of the causes of domestic violence might not increase the chances of war
1006,race has always been a prime cause of conflict
1007,too much stress on ethnicity might bring out more of the belligerence and ag­ gressiveness inherent in man
1008,would not the benefits of the ethnostates domestic policies be nullified by the dangers they the ethnostate 69 provoked in foreign policy
1009,this wellfounded skepticism can be answered and perhaps allayed by asserting that the ethnostate would never fail to take into account mans aggressive nature both as a source of his achievements and of his proneness to violence
1010,in regard to the latter the identification of an ailment is the first step towards its cure
1011,modem warfare can all too easily be ratcheted up to geno­ cide which in an ethnostate with its accent on racial preser­ vation is the crime of crimes
1012,in this light anyone who starts or leads a war of aggression automatically qualifies as a war criminal the moment his troops his warplanes or his missiles violate another countrys frontiers
1013,he is guilty of the geno­ cide not only of a neighboring people but of his own people who will suffer grievously when his victims launch a massive nuclear retaliation
1014,not too many politicians and generals would like to go down in history with such a blot on their reputations
1015,in the past historians have looked upon great conquerors with some toleration even with an element of hero worship
1016,once the criminalization of war has been drilled into their minds the citizens of ethnostates would develop a lasting suspicion of powerhungry leaders who would probably be neutralized before they could show their hands
1017,this suspicion once it is widely diffused might well provide the greatest sur­ ety against war yet devised
1018,there is both irony and gratification in the prospect that the ethnostate the most antiecumenical of states might prove by its enlightened noninterventionist foreign policy to be the most effective and stalwart deterrent to the devastation of the ecumene
1019,chapter 6 unitary politics statecraft
1020,in the measlrement and evaluation of political leadership character is as important if not more important than intelligence
1021,a high iq combined with a high cq char­ acter quotient provides the statesmanlike qualities needed at the helm of every society particularly advanced societies
1022,unlike intelligence character can be measured better by past performance than by tests
1023,a politician cannot have too much intelligence or too much character but he can have too much ambition which becomes a pernicious vice when it prods him to sidestep the law to win and hold office
1024,too much ambition besides propelling a politician beyond the bounds of permissible conduct often advances him to a position for which he is unqualified
1025,ambi­ tion it should be added is an extremely difficult trait to mea­ sure though it is the factor that may weigh most heavily on a politicians performance in office
1026,one means of raising the quality of leadership would be to establish an academy of statecraft with attendance restricted to mature individuals in their midthirties to early forties care­ fully selected on the basis of their resumes
1027,after several semesters of statesmanship the topranking graduates would be moved into departments of government where their work and duties corresponded to their special fields of study and competence
1028,once in active government they would be graded every year and promotions or expulsions would depend on 70 the ethnostate 71 their perfonnance
1029,such a curriculum when combined with high intelligence and exemplary character on the part of the individuals taking it should tum out young statesmen who would radically improve the quality of modem politics which all too often has become the stamping ground of lowly minds
1030,instead of votes graded perfonnance in office would be­ come the test for high officialdom
1031,a high grade in moral behavior would be as important as any other requirement for government posts
1032,moral leaders will simplify statesmanship since their presence in high office would reduce the number of checks and balances an often poorly functioning fonn of protection against political malfeasance
1033,the only means of doing away with government entirely would be to breed a higher type of man
1034,but the eugenics pro­ gram that would make this possible is a nonstarter with timorous western politicians
1035,they simply will not buy the argument that homo sapientissimus a new improved human would lead to the establishment of a new improved govern­ ment that would prioritize morality over constitutions and statutory law
1036,both positive and negative eugenics programs can be put in place in an ethnostate without the necessity of imposing harsh and seemingly inhuman rules and regulations and without insulting or outraging the feelings of those who for religious or other reasons are finnly opposed to any fonn of biological detenninism
1037,the homogeneity of the population would do much to diminish or smooth over dysgenic attitudes and sen­ timents since critics would not be able to associate eugenics with racism
1038,not even liberals should object too strongly to preventing the birth of defective offspring and to encouraging marriages between the more intelligent and more moral ele­ ments of the population
1039,eugenics would produce a bumper crop of gifted children whose talents could be spotted early and who could then be immersed in special education projects
1040,superior genes plus a superior environment designed to squeeze the best perfonn­ ance out of genes should prove a unique combination for producing generations of topoftheline statesmen
1041,72 the ethnostate macfarlane burnet in his book endurance of life has writ­ ten that it will take at least a thousand millennia to change human nature sufficiently to accept a sensible eugenics pro­ gram
1042,let us hope his timetable is off by 999990 years
1043,ethnostates would create small strong unities out of large weak unities and transform the world into a brilliant and colorful patchwork of sovereignties
1044,ethnostates would unite oncedivided communities by distilling out the incompatible racial and cultural groups and where feasible combining like with like
1045,new political entities would be formed largely by rearranging and modifying old ones
1046,race by providing a population group with a set of physical and mental traits that distinguish it from other groups is a strong force for unity
1047,since every political and social entity must have some binding force nothing would serve this purpose better than ethnicity
1048,the grand purpose of ethno­ states is to make the most of human differences by letting them develop and flourish in their own unique settings uninfluenced by alien cultures and races
1049,using atomic fission as a metaphor the splitting of nations and empires can be looked upon as the creation of a huge psychological force field which keeps the human mind radiating
1050,the proper management and control of these bursts of imagination and inventiveness should be a prime goal of political economic and social leadership
1051,some words on citizenship
1052,there is no such animal as a pure citizen a socalled citizen of the universe except in the minds of globalists and wishful thinkers
1053,every person even the protagonist in edward everett hales man without a country started out as a citizen or at least a native of some state
1054,today most westerners are citizens in name only
1055,the various political and social obligations that an authentic citizen owes his country have mostly gone by the boards along with such intangibles of citizenship as a sense of belonging and various sentimental attachments
1056,in the west many of these modern fainthearted halfbaked citizens have been psycho­ logically quarantined inside their own countries while more the ethnostate 73 dynamic population groups take over
1057,they still retain some pride in what their ancestors accomplished in the art of nation­ building but are largely unashamed that they have let their inheritance fall into other hands
1058,people have difficulty believing they are more than nominal citizens of a state in which they have lost faith
1059,without an esprit d etat all that holds a state together is a few shreds of tradition a common economic system and the force of law
1060,this is woefully insufficient cement
1061,in the great moments of western civilization persons were proud to boast i am an athenian 
1062,
1063,
1064,am a florentine  
1065,am a frenchman  i am an englishman 
1066,
1067,
1068,am an american
1069,today many people act­ ually apologize for being citizens of country a b or c in this decadent age it is often considered chauvinistic or even jin­ goistic to claim allegiance to ones own nation
1070,states particularly large and overpopulated nation states should not become holding pens for drifting waves of humanity
1071,they should remain living expressions of the artis­ tic scientific and productive acumen of their citizens
1072,the people who have been making western cities unlivable should have stayed at home and made their own cities livable
1073,ethnostates would encourage their citizens to make their own cities more attractive and comfortable for themselves not for aliens legal or illegal who bring with them the behavior patterns and attitudes that created the slums they left behind
1074,inevitably the cities they move to begin to resemble the ones they fled
1075,the altruistegotist balance
1076,altruism might be defined as both a curse and a blessing
1077,without this instinct we would be living in a hobbesian world of incessant warfare which is to say we would hardly be living at all
1078,on the other hand if we were endowed with too much altruism we would have an equally poor chance of surviving since we would put our own lives second and everyone elses first
1079,in certain circumstances selfsacrifice is beneficial even crucial to survival
1080,but when altruism asks us to put higher values on the lives of others than we put on our own our very existence is at risk
1081,74 the ethnostate the ethnostate is made to order for the maintenance of the proper and often delicate balance of a successful society
1082,it is small and united enough for its authorities to douse the flare­ ups of altruism that can lead to dangerous meddling in the affairs of foreign states
1083,at home too much egotism can end in unrestrained anarchy
1084,though it promotes the cooperation and mutual aid without which civilization is impossible altruism must be reined in when it reaches a states frontiers
1085,it should not be extended to fishing in the muddy waters of other peoples problems
1086,there is always plenty of work cut out for altruism at home
1087,people on the other side of town are often in greater need than some­ one halfway around the globe
1088,we should be very leery of those who keep urging us to work for the greater good of those who care nothing for our good
1089,expansive or exaggerated altruism is a symptom of high civilization on the way down
1090,it is noticeably absent in the birth throes of a state
1091,other caring in the sense of caring for outsiders can only be afforded when the survival of ones own population group is assured
1092,only when individuals no longer have to worry about tomorrow or about acquiring the bare necessities of life can they afford if they are so minded to let their attention roam to foreign shores
1093,on the domestic front as a state ages minorities depend on the altruism of the majority to obtain the privileges they strive for but may not always deserve
1094,to paraphrase shakespeare some minorities are born equal some achieve equality and some have equality thrust upon them
1095,affirmative action operative in varying degrees in practi­ cally all western countries is altruism pushed to the extreme and enacted into law
1096,once this happens and reverse discrimi­ nation becomes the order of the day the level of altruism in the general populace will slowly drop off
1097,traces of egotism can almost always be found in altruistic acts
1098,the donor of a large sum of money to a charity takes great pleasure and pride in giving even when he does so anonymously
1099,western governments have been so successful in showering their own citizens and foreigners with material com the ethnostate 75 forts that they have fallen into what might be called an altruistic frenzy
1100,western foundations and private donors vie with each other in giving the socalled disadvantaged nations whatever they ask for
1101,meanwhile domestic altruism is enshrined in vast budgetbusting welfare programs
1102,too much altruism dulls the work incentive that must be instilled in all able recipients of aid if they are ever to climb above the poverty line
1103,to stop the vicious cycle in which wel­ fare creates demands for more welfare we have to become more egotistic without becoming egomaniacal
1104,altruism is affordable when the political social and particularly the economic conditions are ripe
1105,when they are not altruism is or at least should be put on hold
1106,among its many negatives altruism has a tendency to make us soft and excessively kind to others
1107,not so long ago our ancestors looked upon bloody handtohand warfare with equanimity
1108,today we are squeamish at bullfights and swallow handfuls of pills at the slightest twinge of discomfort
1109,altruism which flourishes in eras of the easy life puts us in the wrong psychological mood to accept physical suffering and abuse which in tum prevents the adoption of the stem measures needed to maintain order and discipline
1110,altruism in short helps to immobilize us in times of crisis
1111,character
1112,controversy swirls around iq scores which are valid for measuring if not intelligence at least verbal agility and mathematical skills
1113,whatever else can be said about them iq scores are fairly good predictors of how well or how poorly a student will do in school and college
1114,but how to measure character
1115,some preeminent psychol­ ogists raymond cattell comes to mind have developed a battery of comprehensive tests to achieve this objective though some psychologists dispute the results
1116,it turns out that minority groups with low average iqs also have character problems
1117,this may explain why certain blacks even those with aboveaverage intelligence often get into trouble the moment they are made cabinet officers congressmen judges mayors police chiefs and sheriffs
1118,there have been of course 76 the ethnostate many whites in similar positions who have committed similar irregularities
1119,but is it not reasonable to suppose that those who have finally broken the old occupational taboos would go out of their way to keep their hands clean
1120,character is an amalgam of honesty prudence industrious­ ness and dedication
1121,all the brains in the world are useless in fact they could be dangerous unless they are modulated by character
1122,different population groups differ in their collective charac­ ter
1123,what is considered a virtue by one group may be a vice to another
1124,this is why it is so important that the leaders of a group be members of that group
1125,grave misunderstandings arise in politics because of innate differences in character between the rulers and the ruled
1126,it hardly needs to be added that there is a definite biological element to character
1127,the greater the biological differences in the population of a country the greater the difficulty of keeping that population in line
1128,character can be taught instilled and character can be altered but always with great difficulty
1129,why not avoid this difficulty by letting like live with likethe fundamental principle of the ethnostate
1130,sore points of democracy
1131,a blunt definition of democracy is that it is only possible and practical among peoples with a high ability to smoke out demagogues
1132,when the system of choosing leaders excludes the wise and favors the windbag the fragile political plant known as democracy begins to wilt
1133,here we are not trying to give credence to the old but impractical saw that political power should be given to those who least desire it
1134,this is too neat a paradox
1135,any man with a gift for politics understands quite well that without political support he will have difficulty getting his ideas over the high barrier that separates thinking from doing
1136,since those who believe they have a good idea generally want to make it known they are drawn willynilly into a quest for power which in the con­ temporary west leads directly into the political thicket of democracy
1137,however when the game of politics is found to be too rough and too distasteful for the power seekers con the ethnostate 77 science when the effort required is no longer commensurate with the objective the political aspirant if he has anything to him at all is likely to quit and return to the familiar and comfortable if much more limiting and prosaic hearth of private life
1138,there are certain demands of politics that are likely to bring the office seekers career to a quick and decisive halt­ demands that grate against his principles and require behavior totally alien to his nature
1139,the mere act of grabbing a micro­ phone at a public meeting and shouting a rebuttal to some slanderous remarks mouthed by an opponent is to many sensitive souls a boorish and repulsive piece of demeaning buffoonery
1140,this inborn revulsion against displays of temper­ ament is found in higher frequencies in some races than in others which helps explain why democracies the efficacy and viability of which depend in large measure on the selfcontrol of both leaders and followers function best in lands populated by less mercurial and more inhibited races
1141,the historical record shows very few entries for negroid and mongoloid democracies
1142,democratic and republican forms of government appear to be a unique feature of europeans particularly north and northwest europeans and their over­ seas descendants
1143,it is too early to assess the staying power of japanese democracy
1144,the erosion of form and style in government inevitably leads to the destruction of content
1145,differences in temperament and character put a large strain on the democratic process when it tries to encompass more than one population group particularly since only whites have demonstrated an enduring affinity for selfgovernment
1146,in this context an authoritarian state is not just the cyclic repair of a disintegrating popular government but a last opportunity for power by those who have lost it
1147,when referring to democracy in the united states it is worthwhile to recall that as of 1991 by far the largest number of congressmen are incumbents and that much of their legislative work has been fobbed off on their staff and on commissions whose members are not elected
1148,these commiss 78 the ethnostate ions though theoretically beholden to congress administer welfare enforce or fail to enforce immigration laws finetune the budget and in the case of the federal reserve bank which is not beholden to congress even determine interest rates and the money supply
1149,the increasing trend towards government by commissions and independent agencies is a trend towards less not more democracy
1150,the radical shift in political definitions in the last six or seven decades is dramatically demonstrated in the 1928 war department training manual 200025 section 118120 which defined democracy as follows a government of the masses
1151,authority derived through mass meeting or any other form of direct expression
1152,results in mobocracy
1153,attitude towards property is communisticnegating property rights
1154,attitude towards law is that the will of the majority shall regulate whether it be based upon deliberation or governed by passion prejudice and impulse without restraint or regard to consequences
1155,results in demagogism license agitation discontent anarchy
1156,nowadays democracy receives a much friendlier press
1157,democratic used as an adjective has become a synonym for good
1158,though the constitution spoke only of a republican form of government democracy draws considerably more attention in current highschool political science courses and textbooks
1159,to function properly democracy demands an intelligent restrained electorate not an emotional mob
1160,if any govern­ ment described as democratic remains democratic for a reasonable length of time the chances are it is a government of the descendants of the people who invented democracy and the only people who ever came close to making it work
1161,both the ancient greeks who invented it and the english who improved on it had considerable infusions of nordic genes
1162,democracy in much of the west has for all intents and pur­ poses supplanted christianity as the state religion
1163,in some areas of academia and politics it has reached a manic stage resembling in intensity and obsessiveness the dancing craze of the middle ages
1164,like an older and abdicating divinity the god of democracy is a jealous god who allows no other form of politics to come before him
1165,even communists felt com the ethnostate 79 pelled to promise democracy to their minions after the workers paradise had passed through which it never did the stage known as the dictatorship of the proletariat
1166,this said
1167,it should be added that democracy
1168,especially in large nations
1169,has become somewhat of a sham
1170,many elected representatives of the people hardly pretend to represent anyone but special interests and lobbies
1171,and have little time to attend to the needs of their own constituencies
1172,while in office
1173,most of their time and energy is expended on avoiding hard political decisions
1174,raising money for their next stint of electioneering and doing favors for the individuals and politi­ cal action committees pacs that contribute the money that will get them reelected
1175,in multiracial democracies government has largely been reduced to buying off the demands of minorities with increas­ ing amounts of welfare and racebased job quotas
1176,this favoritism extends to foreign aid
1177,most of which goes to the overseas cousins of the minorities that make the biggest noise and provide most of the campaign money
1178,in an ethnostate no such racial infighting would or could take place
1179,the business of government would be conducted for the benefit of the people at large
1180,not for the benefit of a few
1181,but even in an ethnostate
1182,where conditions would opti­ mize its effectiveness
1183,democracy would hardly deserve the high theological status it has attained in the west
1184,most great thinkers and political philosophers from the greeks on have assigned democracy a low place on their scale of statecraft
1185,from the presocratics to hobbes few philosophers worth their salt had a good word to say for it
1186,most of the criticism resting on the argument that sooner or later democracy descends into mindlessness
1187,brutality and corruption
1188,despite these repeated warnings
1189,something similar to modern democracy began to take shape in britain in the 17th century although slavery
1190,hardly a democratic institution
1191,was not outlawed by the british till 1828 and survived in the us several decades longer
1192,the universal franchise
1193,the linchpin of democracy
1194,was not fully instituted in the west until this century
1195,although lovers of democracy might characterize the fol 80 the ethnostate lowing questions as blasphemy they will nevertheless be asked would a wise autocrat have permitted the united states to enter world war i the outcome of which almost mandated world war ii
1196, would wise autocrats have drawn up and signed the versailles treaty an open invitation to a future war
1197, would a wise autocrat have permitted the wild and counterproductive stabs at unbridled democracy that all but destroyed the weimar republic in germany
1198, above all would an intelligent american autocrat his own country the first to have fission and fusion bombs have allowed other countries to steal american secrets and build their own weapons of mass destruction
1199,
1200,
1201,would not a smart autocrat have realized that this was a crucial moment in history a nevertoberepeated moment when one country by main­ taining a monopoly of nuclear bombs could have prevented the proliferation of such weapons which
1202,once in the possession of a dozen or so nations would be almost certain to be unleashed on many parts of the world
1203, would a wise autocrat have allowed his country to become entangled in middle eastern wars and politics at an incredible cost in money and some cost in lives to placate the minority that pours more dollars than any other population group into the elect­ ion campaigns of key congressmen who later return the favor by tossing more than 3 billion a year into the bottomless pit of israels economy
1204,history reminds us that democracies start just as many wars as evil dictatorships that democracies destroy the environ­ ment almost as fast and as thoroughly as tyrannies that it is much safer to walk the city streets in authoritarian states than in most democracies
1205,though it can hardly be counted as a plus dictatorships dis­ tribute poverty more evenly than affluent democracies parcel out affluence
1206,both forms of government gathering their strength not from the intelligence but from the stupidity and inertia of their populations produce hopelessly inadequate leaders
1207,some occupants of the white house and the kremlin would make better cab drivers than chief executives of coun the ethnostate 81 tries bristling with nuclear bombs and warheads
1208,though it may sound sacrilegious to say so in this age of equalitarian chic democracy is not the sine qua non of pol­ itics
1209,assuredly the people who have little idea of what is going on beyond what they are pennitted to see on the nightly tv news cannot be expected to vote intelligently on important issues
1210,nor will they be able to cast their ballots for worthy candidates since few such are willing to participate in the electoral rat race
1211,sadly the average voter has practically no input in the choice of candidates selected by party leaders
1212,primaries were invented to overcome this handicap but to little avail
1213,with rare exceptions the electorates choice is still limited to candidates selected by the professionals
1214,since money is the root of all politics in western democracies the politician with the fattest wallets at his beck and call has a considerable head start
1215,short of money and shorn of media support thirdparty or writein candidates nearly always go down in defeat
1216,the fleshless and bloodless monster known as public opinion never ceases to drum into the heads of voters that there are only two fonns of governments democracy which is good and anything else which is evil
1217,this simplistic di­ chotomy has become an article of western faith
1218,platos proposal for rule by philosopher kings is never mentioned unless accompanied by a shrug or a sneer
1219,yet even the most religiose small or big d democrat if he stops to think would be hard put to deny that a government which places highly qualified individuals the creme de la creme of the citizenry into positions of power and leadership would be a good government whether or not it was democratic
1220,democracy eventually becomes in the words of thomas jef­ ferson an elected despotism as the political and economic distance between rulers and ruled lengthens
1221,a direct democ­ racy in the style of ancient athens where every citizen was a member of the assembly could not exist in a nation like the united states where a president and vicepresident and 535 members of the house and senate are chosen to represent the will of 240 million americans
1222,time after time polls have 82 the ethnostate shown that the governments of large democracies rather than representing a majority of the citizenry promote the agenda of one or two minorities
1223,in the united states most citizens want a sharp reduction in immigration and an end to reverse discriminationfrontbumer issues that the leading politicians fearful of a liberal and media backlash will not touch
1224,it is not blasphemous to suggest that a few unelected wise men at the helm of state could do a better job than hundreds of elected fools
1225,the standard objection to such a suggestion is that the wise men would soon tum into tyrants a danger that democracies avoid by constitutional checks and balances
1226,the objection to this objection which is not often heard is that wise men are not compelled by some insidious gene or interior demon to tum into tyrants
1227,if they are truly wise they would be very careful not to indulge in any provocative absolutism that might bring back democracy
1228,the querulous devotees of the rule of the people will want to know how these wise leaders will be chosen
1229,for one thing they would not be chosen as presentday politicians areby huge outpourings of cash into party coffers by furtive underthetable political deals and by inane television commercials
1230,it would seem only reasonable that a higher type of candidate for office would emerge if he were not selected by party hacks and a plurality of voters who know next to nothing about him
1231,the fate of a state often depends on the head of state
1232,would it not be wiser after a careful review of his achievements to date plus a thorough assessment of his intelli­ gence and character to have him chosen by a board of out­ standing citizens rather than by an uninfonned collection of citizens who are all too easily mesmerized by the slickest demagogue
1233,be that as it may the most suitable fonn of government for an ethnostate would be the one that best fits the traditions and customs of its population
1234,most of the worlds peoples have had no experience with democracy having lived forever under strongmen and monarchs
1235,although it would never be intimated on highrated tv news programs more important than getting out the vote is getting topquality leaders
1236,to the ethnostate 83 attain this allimportant goal no type of government should be impervious to change and modification
1237,the best political advice to the citizens of an ethnostate would be do what is necessary to put the power of the state in the hands of the most capable among you not the least capable
1238,admit it or not there is an aspect of politics aside from the desire for power and fame that attracts scoundrels­ money
1239,to remove the financial lure in politics should be a principal task of all statesmen democratic or autocratic
1240,if democratic pundits can answer the following question convincingly an overall argument can be made for democracy
1241,if they cannot then this hallowed form of gov­ ernment should be desacralized
1242,the question is it sensible or even moral for every citizen to have an equal vote which at least in theory translates into an equal voice in deciding impor­ tant domestic and foreign issues
1243,consider two citizens citizen a with an 82 iq has never held a job for more than three months has been on welfare almost continuously since his birth and has five children whom he has abandoned along with the five unmarried women who were their mothers
1244,compare citizen a with citizen b an awardwinning scientist with several inventions to his credit an iq of 145 and a stable family consisting of a wife and two wellbroughtup children
1245,no hint of divorce philandering drugs or ctime appears in his personal history
1246,despite the sharp contrast in these two resumes the votes of citizen a and citizen b weigh equally in any election
1247,citizen a votes as he is told by the head of a powerful minority voting bloc
1248,citizen b on the other hand is an independent voter who belongs to no party
1249,after some scrutiny of opposing candi­ dates and a little soulsearching he casts his ballot for the candidate who seems to be more knowledgeable about the issues
1250,despite their vast differences in character knowledge and general allaround capability we are told again and again by politicians educators and mediacrats that citizens a and b should have an equal say in choosing the people who govern them
1251,instead of this most serious of all democratic defects correcting itself it grows worse as citizen a types become 84 the ethnostate more numerous owing to disparate birthrates
1252,it is possible to make a case for democracy in a small country with a highly educated highly responsible population group
1253,but what can be said for a democracy that provides a stage for an irresponsible demagogue urging an ever larger bloc of indolent and ignorant voters to vote for him or for candidates he already has in his pocket
1254,politics must advance beyond democracy whose intolerant priests seek to quash any attempts to develop more advanced systems
1255,to the ruling establishment any speculation that goes beyond democracy is considered impermissible as well as disrespectable
1256,even where democracies are overthrown the leader dictator general or commissar who assumes power will often bow lower to public opinion than did his democratic predecessors
1257,since the ruler thrown up in the antidemocratic upheaval will most likely be a man of the people or a man on horse­ back he may be no better qualified to govern than the blow­ hards he has ousted
1258,the wise man who has to be drafted to lead is a far safer choice than the politico elected to lead than the rightist or leftist revolutionary who claws his way to power than the general who takes over by a coup d etat
1259,tolerating tolerance
1260,too much democracy produces an­ archy which leads to autocracy which leads back again to democracy
1261,too much tolerance produces intolerance which eventually cycles to a new birth of tolerance
1262,tolerance as it is understood and practiced in modern times stands for tolerance of both the good and the bad
1263,tolerance of the good generates more tolerance which inevitably leads to increasing tolerance for evil
1264,the fact is the evil consequences of tolerance often have more popular appeal than the good consequences
1265,a wave of pornography is the immediate and automatic re­ sponse to sexual tolerance
1266,tolerance can be prevented from provoking intolerance by choking off its negative side and encouraging it not to attack tolerance per se but the everything goes tolerance that leads to social decay and moral degradation if overindulgence the ethnostate 85 in premarital and extramarital sex is a contributing cause of the decline of civilization then tolerance of sexual permissive­ ness should be reconsidered
1267,if marxists harvard professors and various other nurturists try to outlaw genetic research on the tenuous ground that it leads to biological determinism then this particularly nauseous exhibit of intolerance must not be tolerated
1268,tolerance of censors of those who shut off debates on issues to which they are opposed needs to be exercised with a certain amount of caution
1269,in crucial areas of human behavior tolerance is largely judgmental
1270,historically the only people who have practiced tolerance on the grand scale have been westerners and then only for limited periods of time
1271,but even this relatively short­ lived and sporadic tolerance must be more than an environ­ mental coincidence
1272,people who have a predisposition for tolerance and who live in their own state among their own kind will have less reason or occasion to be intolerant
1273,they will not be bothered or irri­ tated by the different behavior and attitudes of alien popula­ tion groups
1274,in consequence they will be better able to restrict their disputes to the realm of ideas and avoid racial and religious digressions
1275,doctrinal updating
1276,it is no surprise that the argument for ethnostates clashes headon with the doctrine of nationhood
1277,the british constitution is unwritten but it contains a body of law some elements of which accelerated the breakup of the empire but which would directly oppose devolution in the united kingdom
1278,to establish ethnostates in america the written constitution would have to be amended in such a manner as to make it almost unrecognizable
1279,among much else the declaration of independences appeal for a more perfect union would have to be discarded in the wastebasket of ideas that have outlived their usefulness and been outmoded by time
1280,traditions established by enduring forms of statehood exert a powerful force for conserving the state and for clinging to the status quo which is why the breakup of larger into smaller 86 the ethnostate political entities will be as fiercely resisted by conservatives as by liberals and leftists
1281,for this reason ethnostate advocates would do well to emphasize and highlight the impermanence of doctrine
1282,doctrine emerges from the collective will if not of the people at least of an elite
1283,it addresses both the historical experience and the problems at hand
1284,it steadies the ship of state and makes a great deal of sense as long as the seas do not get too stormy and the keel holds fast
1285,the american founding fathers composed the bill of rights which provided strong legal protection to trespassers of the law by guaranteeing them due process
1286,if james madison and george mason the two gentlemen most responsible for amendments i through x of the constitution had lived in new york city two centuries later and faced the same task would they have produced the same document
1287,the bill of rights was devised for a small pioneering nation whose citizenry de­ rived almost entirely from the british isles
1288,these britons had developed a certain respect for individual rights and had al­ ready succeeded in abolishing some of the more tyrannical aspects of absolutism
1289,two centuries later in new york city where crime is almost out of control where the british element of the population has all but vanished where the population is largely composed of inimical and feuding racial groups many of whose members had migrated from countries with no experience whatsoever with democracy the conditions confronting the authors work­ ing on a new bill of rights would be radically different from the conditions that existed in the late 18th century
1290,at work on a new or revised bill of rights madison and mason would certainly have extended much more legal pro­ tection to the victims of crime than to criminals
1291,nevertheless leaders of almost all political persuasions as well as the minor­ ity members who directly benefit from the liberties provided by the first ten amendments keep appealing to the constitu­ tion and due process when they try in most cases in vain to cope with the surge of criminality
1292,unheedful of the sound proverbial advice autres temps autres moeursthe same con­ stitutional protections are still in place
1293,what was appropriate the ethnostate 87 two centuries ago for one population group is by no means appropriate for a totally different mix of people in a vast unwieldy crimeridden heterogeneous nation
1294,doctrine depends on time and place
1295,when time and place change doctrine if it is to continue to have any relevancy must change
1296,as history painfully demonstrates however it is one of the last things to change
1297,more often than not political doctrines have to be dragged up to the present and revised and remodeled by force
1298,the more doctrine lags behind the times the more abrupt will be the way it is changed when it can no longer avoid change
1299,the breathless modernization of japan in the latter half of the 19th century the transformation of the british empire into the british commonwealth the con­ vulsions of the soviet union in the 20th century the estab­ lishment of the european communityall these radical changes sometimes violent sometimes peaceful were preceded or accompanied by radical changes of doctrine
1300,almost anyone can piece together a doctrine
1301,the trick is to formulate one that is realistic that applies to the conditions at hand and has a better than even chance of being implemented
1302,in an age when much of the world is graying with pollution uniformity and lawlessness when nations are losing what little character they have left growing numbers of westerners are ready to shed anachronistic doctrines for ones better suited to the times
1303,hanging on to dead ideas that should have been buried long since is besides being an invitation to disaster a perversion that comes close to ideological necrophilia
1304,equalitarian mania
1305,equality reduced to its bare essentials is simply a spur word that prods one population group to believe its lack of achievement and secondrate status are not its fault but the fault of others
1306,equality fired by the altruistic instinct active or latent in man is an issue madetoorder for emotional politics
1307,envy ambition hypocrisy and mendacity are traits that are easily all too easily linked to leveling and egalitarian movements
1308,knowing full well that the equality they preach can never be achieved irresponsible politicians promote it all the more 88 the ethnostate feverishly well aware that their grandstanding promises can rouse people especially minorities to flock to the voting booth
1309,in all their flights of inflammatory oratory these class warriors never actually tell their followers to go out and rob those who are conceived to be better off
1310,they phrase their words more carefully but that is the message they are really conveying
1311,instead of outright confiscation of property and a straightforward allaround redistribution of wealth the polit­ ical levelers restrict their talk to progressive income taxes minority setasides and quotas and sundry other financial machinations to redistribute wealth into the open palms of the disadvantaged
1312,deny it as the class warriors will their stump speeches add up to plain and simple electoral bribery
1313,there would be less of this leveling demagoguery in an ethnostate if only because there would be more equality to start with
1314,by definition multiracial and multicultural states tend to have an excess of the social and economic inequalities that bedevil any society including the incendiary and abrasive feelings of inequality provoked by the presence of several races
1315,the physical traits separating and identifying people are more difficult to hide or camouflage than differences in character and intelligence
1316,those who because of their in­ herited differences often get the short end of the stick in racially mixed societies are not always willing to accept their lowly status supinely
1317,on occasion they are driven to obtain by mass violence what they believe they cannot acquire by indi­ vidual effort
1318,it is unnecessary to point out that a revolution incited by racial as well as economic differences is easier to instigate than one based simply on unequal divisions of wealth
1319,since an ethnostate will not be handicapped by racial divi­ siveness it will have one less endemic source of popular discontent with which to contend
1320,fewer evidences of in­ equality will make the state more stable and revolutionproof
1321,by allowing its leaders to concentrate on the problems of one people their own people rather than on a welter of peoples the ethnostate would be able to create and implement more equitable economic policies and programs without the terrible the ethnostate 89 waste of time and manpower multiracial states are forced to devote to racial issues
1322,even in the relatively rare case when an oppressed popula­ tion group obtains equal rights with the dominant group racial agitation seldom ends
1323,it is not too long a leap from the demands for equal opportunity to laws mandating equal results from outlawing discrimination against an oppressed group to legalizing discrimination by this same group against its former oppressors
1324,affirmative action no matter how you slice it is nothing but reverse racism
1325,the campaign for equality is such a popular political ploy that politicians are reluctant to
1326,give it up even when equality has become the law of the land
1327,minority spokesmen find it politically inexpedient to acknowledge that the fight has been won but go on as beforeuntil they reach the point where they have outequaled majority members
1328,sooner or later the outs turn the tables on the ins and rely on their own brand of racism to guard and expand their new ascendancy
1329,readers of preenlightenment political philosophers and writers on the human condition sense a certain hardness that has all but disappeared from the work of their modern coun­ terparts
1330,perhaps hardness is too harsh a term
1331,a more circum­ spect way of putting it might be that western thinkers several centuries ago were less burdened by sentiment
1332,sentiment entered western political philosophy by way of humanitarianism the path for which was prepared by chris­ tianity
1333,humanitarians do not necessarily believe all men are equal but they do believe that all men should be treated equally
1334,thomas jefferson could write that all men are cre­ ated equal while lording it over an army of slaves at monticello
1335,he may have treated his slaves kindly but cer­ tainly not as equals
1336,today humanitarianism demands that people not only be treated equally but be viewed as equals
1337,religionists subscribe to this theory by preaching more about mankind than man
1338,ironically in all organized religions hier­ archy soon replaces equality in the upper reaches of the clergy
1339,the concept of the ethnostate places less emphasis on 90 the ethnostate humanity in the abstract
1340,and more emphasis on real human differences
1341,the mere acknowledgment of such differences calls for a comprehensive and more developed human tax­ onomy
1342,all the new anthropological and biological data piling up in research laboratories these days may lead to a sig­ nificant redefinition of man
1343,for thousands of years one sel­ dom thought of men without thinking of their breed
1344,race or stock was seldom separated from the individual who was looked upon so unsentimentally that for much of human his­ tory slavery was accepted and even advocated by many of the foremost philosophers and statesmen
1345,this is not to recommend that the american south should rise again
1346,had it not been for the peculiar institutionthere might be less egalitarianism in contemporary political dis­ course
1347,slavery the worst example of inequality permitted abolitionists to make their case more effectively and dra­ matically and in the process give a huge boost to false notions about the unimportance of human differences
1348,what is being recommended here is not a return to human bondage but a modified reworking of the old practice of viewing men and women as members of breeds stocks and races of viewing them as biological as well as political and economic beings
1349,this is not to put some races above others but simply to admit their differences and to endow the social sciences with a larger fund of anthropological knowhow
1350,people have no trouble associating dogs horses or many other animals wild and domestic with particular breeds
1351,only in regard to man and only in relatively recent times has it become an act of bigotry to speak too loudly or write too energetically about human breeds
1352,the question of freedom
1353,no one is free or even halffree
1354,we have no say over our birth and do what we will we cannot escape death though we can hasten or delay it
1355,chief among manmade restrictions on freedom are laws
1356,we rationalize these legal curbs by saying freedom can only be obtained by limiting freedom
1357,we enact laws to regulate manners behavior dress codes even speech
1358,too many of these regulations in the ethnostate 91 fringe on the freedom to be oneself perhaps the greatest freedom of all
1359,free nations are best we are taught from the first grade on although free nations have their unfree periods and in time of war are often as tyrannical as socalled authoritarian states
1360,we are not taught indeed we have never been taught that the crime rate is often highest in those countries where the most popular of presentday freedomshuman rightsis the great­ est of all rights a sort of latterday ten commandments all rolled up into one
1361,perhaps it is time to take another look at freedom a topic that has been so drowned in rhetoric that it has lost whatever real meaning it may once have had
1362,today the word freedom has degenerated into little more than a oneword religious chant something similar to the hare krishna om
1363,when it appears in writing or speech it hardly registers on the mind
1364,a word that contains a lot of punch when used sparingly be­ comes meaningless when used indiscriminately
1365,the only freedom that really counts is the ability to make sensible choices and decisions that are beyond the reach of mother nature and father nurture
1366,the man who is most free is the inventor or artist
1367,it is impossible for anyone to be genuinely creative unless he has separated and freed himself at least partially from the existential norms of the human condition
1368,those interested in freedom should remember that the freest person is the least involved the least entangled person
1369,simi­ larly the freest people are those least involved and least en­ tangled with other countries and population groups
1370,the freest form of foreign policy is isolationism which obviates entang­ lements that mandate involvement in the affairs of others
1371,different races and cultures have different attitudes towards free expression
1372,what is culture shock to one population group may be perfectly acceptable to another group
1373,free speech encourages the free and open exchange of ideas but all too often it decays into a rancorous tool for slander
1374,as individuals freely outshout each other the insults erupt into a volcanic flow of calumny
1375,92 the ethnostate leadership
1376,who would knowingly vote for a candidate for political office who has no principles
1377,who would cast his ballot for a moral skeleton who rattles and shifts with the political breezes who in the course of service to his people goes through one political reincarnation after another whose set of beliefs one day is dumped for an opposite set the next day whose voting record is as transient as alternating current
1378,democracies it must be confessed have often elected such scoundrels to high office
1379,anyone who studies the performance of prominent 20th­ century western politicians has to come to the conclusion that the method of electing leaders worthy of their salt has broken down
1380,democracy often seems to be in the business of se­ lecting against leadership qualities
1381,election campaigns have become traveling circuses in which the candidates are the chief clowns
1382,those most qualified for leadership would be the last to take part in such distasteful rigmaroles
1383,among the many defects of presentday democratic elect­ ions one of the most salient is the triumph of decibels and physical energy over reason and intelligence
1384,although the wise speak more intelligently than the unwise the very foundation of their wisdom is a gestalt of temperament and introversion that prevents them from proclaiming their wisdom at every street corner that keeps them from promoting their political programs strenuously enough to overcome the noisy but empty bleating of their fasttalking rivals
1385,because they must appeal to a multitude of different con­ stituencies politicians in a multiracial and multicultural state try to be all things to all men
1386,it being impossible under such circumstances for any politician to make everyone happy only an actor a demagogue or an inveterate prevaricator can pretend to pull off such a feat
1387,in contrast the ethnostate leg­ islator is one with his constituents
1388,he knows with whom he is dealing and whom he represents
1389,he has to make fewer com­ promises and promises
1390,he can afford to be less of a political chameleon
1391,by furnishing a better launching pad and a better environment for leadership all else being equal ethnostates should be overflowing not with politicians but with statesmen
1392,the ethnostate 93 a multiplicity of favorable events and circumstances have to jell at one particular point in time to produce a great leader or statesman
1393,in climactic epochs the present era in the west being one of them it is open season on politicians who put principles above popularity
1394,the result is leaderless resis­ tance a situation in which inexperienced but dedicated men spring up to take the place of the officials who are killed hounded out of office or prevented from campaigning for office the moment they talk forthrightly about issues
1395,reconsiderations
1396,as there are economies of scale so there is the politics of scale both of which while they ease some of the problems of managing large societies multiply others
1397,economies of scale make it profitable to manufacture some products more efficiently and cheaply but they sharply reduce choice if not quality and they have a tendency to turn productionline workers into robots
1398,the politics of scale eventuates in mountains of laws rules and regulations devised to allow bureaucrats to control the behavior of disparate population groups which if given free rein might explode in civil and racial strife
1399,as we have all learned to our sorrow bureaucracies not only tend towards selfperpetuation but towards selfaggrandizementthe more government agencies the greater the pressure to increase the number of agencies the greater the cultural and racial mix the greater the need to force a heterogeneous populace to do what a homogeneous people would often do instinctively and voluntarily
1400,ethnostates would be made to order for small and stream­ lined governments since there would be no need for reams of legislation to protect and compensate the less capable and less successful ethnic groups that proliferate in pluralistic societies
1401,the racebased judicial decisions and rulings that pour out of court hoppers in a large multiracial state would overload the data bank of a mainframe computer
1402,though the politics of scale and the economy of scale are always attempting to make government and business more workable and efficient they are also busy engendering mon­ sters of centralization
1403,the best proving ground for 21stcen 94 the ethnostate tury politics is definitely not a huge nation state which makes truly innovative approaches to government almost impossible
1404,with a large number of small states available for political and economic experimentation progress towards new political solutions could be greatly advanced
1405,tests conducted under many different conditions and circumstances are likely to be more productive than those made in one concretized environment
1406,political inventiveness will never amount to much unless the creativity of the citizenry is unleashed
1407,the legal and psycho­ logical barriers in multiracial states where almost every move private and public must bow to racial considerations has the effect of crippling ingenuity
1408,even science has had to bend to the equalitarian mystique now rampant in the first world
1409,with tough government restrictions placed on genetic research and with the study of racial differences dangerous to an anthro­ pologists or geneticists career it should be obvious that many of the most important problems facing modem man will not be fully addressed as long as multiracial and multicultural politics remains the only permissible politics in western coun­ tries
1410,paradoxically the honest antiracist will have a much better chance of seeing his dreams of racial harmony come true in a world of ethnostates than in a gigantic unwieldy multinational state of clashing ethnic groups
1411,an ethnostate because of its relatively small size and because of the communal attitudes which it infuses in its citizenry could afford to be loosely run meaning that it could get by with minimal laws while offering everyone maximum opportunities for involvement in government
1412,minutiae
1413,aside from working to reduce the size of his political realm the successful politician of the future should be a good prophet
1414,he should have a program already worked out to cope with his predictions when they materialize
1415,contrary to jesus expert opinion prophets even in their own country are not without honor when their forecasts dire or roseate come to pass
1416,despite his doomsaying and his neces the ethnostate 95 sarily unpopular views the politician with his finger on the pulse of his peopleand on historywill put his pollyanna­ sounding rivals in the shade in times of crisis
1417,successful politics is based on an intelligent mix of short­ term and longterm thinking
1418,in the past political considera­ tions often yielded to individual worries about salvation
1419,now that so many of us disbelieve in an afterlife the politicians wish to leave behind a good name and a respectable post­ humous reputation is likely to exert more influence on his actions and behavior than religion
1420,promises of eternal bliss in heaven or eternal damnation below once helped sustain a measure of honesty and decency in office
1421,now that most western politicians have lost their fear of divine retribution we must forget the old adage that gods have often been better able than mortals to get man to behave
1422,with divine intervention removed from human affairs people must now depend on reason common sense intelligence and peer pressure for good government
1423,although liberals of both the honest and dishonest variety seem to be the last to know it the age of liberalism is over
1424,every age has its enshrined credos which often start out as impregnable truths
1425,liberalism in one form or another helped disperse the obscurantist fog of feudalism and absolute mon­ archy
1426,having served its purpose it has no more relevance than that equally moribund political philosophy known as con­ servatism
1427,what on earth is conservative about worshipping freemarket economics and giving hardly a thought to the racial and cultural havoc wreaked by the huge influx into the white world of nonwhite immigrants
1428,if conservatism means anything it should be concerned first and foremost with conserving the race
1429,the threat of physical violence and mass disturbances is sometimes the accelerator sometimes the squelcher of political activity particularly in regard to legislation
1430,politicians have learned to expect violent reactions to their votes on important bills
1431,having grown up in a world of terrorist attacks and assassinated government officials the congressman mp
1432,or deputy knows his own life is less protected than that of presi 96 the ethnostate dents and prime ministers
1433,if theodore roosevelt huey long the two kennedys george wallace and ronald reagan can be killed or wounded by assassins or wouldbe assassins lowlier less guarded public officials make easier targets
1434,to vote for unrestricted immigration racial quotas or other special rights and privileges for minorities carries with it at this point in time few possibilities of retaliation
1435,such legislation only angers but does not activate majority whites
1436,con­ gressmen or parliamentarians who want to reduce immigra­ tion and vote against racial quotas however invite if not phys­ ical retaliation the daytoday pummeling of a rabid media
1437,to avoid the heat many politicians regardless of their own beliefs and feelings vote on the most controversial legislation as their countrys liberalminority coalition prescribes
1438,political strategy
1439,coming economic crises and racial disturbances are almost sure to force political responses that will shock and dismay diehard believers in western demo­ cracy
1440,the way each crisis is handled or rather mishandled will strengthen some of the selling points that will eventually serve as weapons in the psychological armory of ethnostates
1441,the following is a tentative list of the more serious issues that the west must successfully cope with if high civilization is to be preserved • survival
1442,we no longer have to rely on professional pessi­ mists to detect and explicate the trends that may lead beyond the dispossession of western man to his extinction
1443,there is more than a bare possibility of a final solution in the 21st and 22nd centuries for whites wherever and whenever they decline from majorities to minorities
1444,of all such whites euro­ americans are probably in the greatest danger
1445,• race
1446,being attacked as a race we have no choice but to defend ourselves as a race
1447,to be successful such a defense must include raising racial morale by a crash course on west­ ern mans greatness his outstanding role in history his superb artistic scientific economic and political achievementsin sum his magisterial genetic qualities
1448,the ethnostate 97 • history
1449,the brilliance of western civilization in past cen­ turies must be compared favorably to the shoddiness of what still passes for high culture in western countries with particular reference to the barbarism brought about by the influx of nonwhites into the wests racial heartlands
1450,• morality
1451,standards of behavior have sunk so frightfully low that human instincts seem to be yielding to animal instincts
1452,widely touted and promoted by a corrupt media and a depraved academia and constantly egged on by uncloseted homosexuals what amounts to a cultural grab bag of sexual perversions mindwrenching drugs political and financial chi­ canery and violent crime is being emptied on the west on a roundtheclock basis
1453,• vengeance
1454,many of our setbacks have been caused by a deliberate campaign of retribution by minorities bemused by newly confected ideological histories some written by their white toadies
1455,obsessed with revenge for sins real or imagined nonwhite avengers are turning many metropolitan areas and closein suburbs into battlefields
1456,• pride
1457,no westerner worth the name wants to be a second­ class citizen in what was once his own country
1458,less than a century ago we were kings of all we surveyed
1459,now we are the subjects of scatological jokes by columnists and television comedians
1460,• truth
1461,western mans achievements rest largely on his fas­ cination with truth
1462,in science in the arts he wants to get it right
1463,minority rhetoric and denunciations are no substitute for facts
1464,• aesthetics
1465,certain concepts of beauty grace and taste appertain to men and women of northern european origin
1466,the ugliness and animalism that characterize the rise of a black underclass has instilled a disgust that can be turned into a powerful motivating force for racial rebirth
1467,all the above issues will become more cogent and com­ pelling as future events unfold
1468,what will delay their catching fire is the sublime ignorance in which even intelligent minds are kept by the media which report and interpret the decline 98 the ethnostate of the west in a manner deliberately designed to dull and neutralize any remedial reaction
1469,one solution to the problem of disinformation is the mass distribution of a few key books and pamphlets to unlock the jail cells of ignorance in which so many westerners have been imprisoned
1470,countennedia must be nurtured and cultivated to expose the liberal and minority tilt of the mainstream press and television
1471,another factor that serves to dampen any immediate and effective response to the serious dilemmas facing the west is cowardice
1472,the average westerner even if he understands his peoples predicament is afraid to do anything about itafraid to join any prowestern organization afraid to order and even read prowestern literature afraid to speak his mind even to family and friends
1473,he knows what will happen to his liveli­ hood and reputation if he is branded a racist
1474,the higher his position on the economic social or political ladder the harder and more painful would be his fall
1475,the desire for respectability is one of the greatest hin­ drances to western resurgence
1476,aristocrats and elitists are notorious for their unwillingness to dirty their hands in poli­ tics
1477,many leaders in government the professions and business despite their public protestations of affection for the working class consider themselves so far above the common herd that they would not dream of taking part in riotous public meetings or street demonstrations
1478,events as they unfold may overcome some of this coward­ ice since desperation is a catalyst of courage
1479,peer pressure will also help to set the stage for action
1480,it is hard for a person to keep hiding his head in the sand when an increasing number of friends and neighbors are lifting up theirs
1481,joining a group working for a vital cause is a great help in overcoming fear and trembling
1482,appeals to reason however can only go so far in mobilizing people for concerted action
1483,appeals to instinct are far more productive
1484,this is why it is more effective to zero in on the social rather than the political errors of opponents always re­ membering that people have a greater memory for wrongs than rights
1485,
1486,the ethnostate 99 to enlist sympathy and support we should look to friends not strangers
1487,in general we will listen more attentively to a family member than to an acquaintance more apt to heed a leader who is a paragon of respectability than some oper­ ator
1488,people prefer to work for people they can look up to
1489,they are deathly afraid of pitching in with charlatans
1490,any politician who has a suspicious past will have to work twice as hard to attract followers as someone with an unblemished rsum
1491,the prime task of any leader is to inspire people who have been drugged into inaction to act
1492,proportional representation could be an opening wedge
1493,the more parties the less chance of repressing political activism
1494,ethnostatists must learn to practice a political form of jujitsu the trick of concentrating the superior strength of the opponent against himself
1495,it is difficult to attack principles without wounding or anger­ ing those who espouse them
1496,that is why so few vitally impor­ tant political or social issues can be resolved peaceably
1497,ethno­ statists must not allow themselves to give up or go soft on a fight because they are occasionally roughed up
1498,to win their battles they must adopt the tactics appropriate to a military operation on unfavorable terrain
1499,no one in an untenable sit­ uation should fight for every inch of ground
1500,like the roman general fabius cunctator the smart tactician withdraws bides his time and awaits a more favorable opportunity
1501,we distinguish between missionaries who attempt to convert infidels and the infidels themselves
1502,we understand what the men of god are up to
1503,but we do not distinguish between the political missionaries attempting to convert us and ourselves
1504,consequently we do not understand their motives which are anything but pure
1505,our best young brains are only beginning to suspect how they are being used and abused
1506,almost from the first grade our children have been taught that what is right for others is right for them notwithstanding that the olhers may have a diametrically opposite view of what is or is not right
1507,and act accordingly
1508,class war has been a tried and tested way to overthrow a 100 the ethnostate dominant majority or minority
1509,would a proletarian revolution be an effective means of establishing ethnostates
1510,whenever more power and money fall into the grasp of minorities there is the possibility of a strong backlash from an oppressed majority or an oppressed minority that was once a majority
1511,secession however not revolution would seem to be the safest surest most practical and least violent way to bring an ethnostate into being
1512,a word to americans
1513,the basic political strategy for the ethnostate movement in america should be to channel the frustrations of majority americans into building dynamic po­ litical organizations
1514,no longer should the two major parties be allowed to get away with the pretense of representing main­ stream america which no matter what the political seers and commentators say is a racial group whose members are limited to americans of european mainly northern european de­ scent
1515,as such majority americans in the vernacular of physical anthropology are preponderantly nordic and alpine in race
1516,since race is the ultimate binding force of political activism majority americans must be the genetic mainstay of ethnostate movements in the united states
1517,the tergiversating white politicians who try to deny and get around this basic demographic fact should be treated with the contempt reserved for prevaricators and the opprobrium reserved for enemies
1518,we must not only learn to know who our friends are but after knowing them we must educate enlighten and inspirit them
1519,we must also come to the unhappy conclusion that all those who look like us and are our racial cousins are not to be automatically trusted
1520,there are still far too many rewards for betrayal far too much thoughtmolding and mindbending going on for all majority americans to develop a healthy immunity to liberal and minority agitprop
1521,educate arouse act
1522,these are the wellworn steppingstones to power
1523,but they should be traversed in that order
1524,arousal before education acting before being properly aroused are invitations to failure
1525,misplaced priorities do not set the stage for momentous deeds
1526,the ethnostate 101 reformists
1527,the profession of refonner is an attractive one mainly because it hinges more on promises than results
1528,enjoying the same special dispensation from proof accorded the preacher who offers his congregation immortality the refonner specializes in projecting unprovable and untestable visions of a better life
1529,he is applauded or tolerated even if he advocates changing what does not need to be changed and overlooks deliberately or not the faults in the social order that cry out for correction
1530,the arguments and emotions are all on the side of the person who stirs things up not the person who wants calm and recommends thinking twice before jumping
1531,as for the sincerity and honesty of the refonner these ques­ tions should be asked is he for refonn because he really wants to improve the peoples lot or is he driven by some inner compulsion that has nothing to do with principle but much to do with ego
1532,would he be politicking just as hard and promis­ ing just as much in a perfect society as in a perfectly awful so­ ciety
1533,would he shift his principles 180 degrees and argue for entirely different refonns in a state that had enacted into law all his previous demands and recommendations
1534,such quest­ ions come to mind whenever someone is making a profession of shouting the demagogue or whispering the conspirator that the world or his country is falling apart and that people must do such and such instanter or perish
1535,deep politics
1536,western political science like its progenitor western culture is the gift of the gifted to the ungifted
1537,a few westerners of superior character and strength of mind are re­ sponsible for almost everything positive that the west has accomplished in the field of politics
1538,all the democracy all the leveling all the egalitarianism in the world cannot make strong what is inherently weak
1539,put the weak in charge as is now being done throughout the west and soon there will be little to take charge of
1540,genes have set the stage for high politics by giving a few men the capability of creating what most are incapable of creatingadvanced fonns of government
1541,westerners should be thankful for and listen to such men
1542,102 the ethnostate what we see around us today is not so much decadence as the disappearance of strong minds from the political forum and the pitiful attempts of weak
1543,minds to manage what they are powerless to manage
1544,the heroes of history are the men who lift their people out of a morass of anarchy and social chaos and set the stage for a brilliant efflorescence of human activity
1545,ethnostates need heroic founding fathers whose labors will transform possibly even transfigure world politics
1546,there is little profit in opposing and attacking the pluralistic nation state with appeals to tradition and oldfashioned west­ ern values
1547,aphorisms like fair play and an honest days work for an honest dollar permeated the west when it was composed of a largely monoracial white substrate of the world population
1548,today these values have all but disappeared in clouds of deceit and hypocrisy
1549,before they can have any real meaning and influence again we must slough off the moral confusion foisted upon us by different cultural norms
1550,there is scant room for 19thcentury western moral standards in the beleaguered late 20thcentury west
1551,to sur­ vive we must return to the basic and much older values of survival which predominated in the beginnings of western civilization
1552,the time has come to break out of the liberal mindset which triggered so many of the wests cultural marvels but which is now hopelessly out of date and busy destroying what it so brilliantly created
1553,in all too many ways the modem westerner is being programmed to deal with a world that no longer exists
1554,such a perverse education can only have disastrous psychological effects on the good minds who know what should be done but also know that merely by advancing a few sensible proposals they will be viewed as heretics and given the silent treatment or overt animus meted out to maverick thinkers throughout the ages
1555,overcoming a hostile intellectual atmosphere requires the kind of courage that is always in short supply
1556,narrowing the schism
1557,it is the nature of the liberal to be forever anxious to help someone or something
1558,in a multi the ethnostate 103 racial state he is in his element because there are always one or more population groups that can be classified as needy
1559,also in a perpetual state of need are many foreign nations
1560,third world countries are forever on the edge of famine or bank­ ruptcy
1561,if he is rich the liberal will donate money to the disadvan­ taged both at home and abroad
1562,if he is an intellectual while agitating for the poor he will often use them as pawns for his own ideological and political ends
1563,in times of prosperity wel­ fare becomes a growth industry that offers professional liberals cushy wellpaying jobs in foundations and various charitable organizations
1564,in bad times as government concentrates its attention on poverty and unemployment liberal activity in­ creases exponentially and altruism the liberals overriding instinct moves into high gear
1565,in a multiracial state the last people to get the attention of the liberal are often his own people
1566,his surfeit of othercaring may drive him to dwell on the problems of those who are as far removed from him as possibleracially and culturally
1567,what appears to be the liberals cold unfeeling abandonment of his own fellow citizens often provokes a conservative or na­ tionalist backlash that creates a schism in the body politic
1568,the ethnostate being monoracial and isolationist would force the liberal to focus his altruism on his own kind
1569,reducing foreign aid might in the short run cause additional suffering in the poorer areas of the world but at least it would encourage these countries to solve their own problems instead of relying eternally on outsiders a practice which if continued indefinitely would augment rather than decrease their poverty
1570,without the racial agitation traditionally stirred up by lib­ eralisms pandering to minorities domestic tranquillity would be given an important boost
1571,also liberals themselves become more respected and more liked when it becomes known they are targeting their goodwill and their good money on the home folks
1572,when liberals win the trust of the public their conservative opponents lose much of their political ammunition
1573,the right can no longer accuse the left of wasting the resources of the 104 the ethnostate state on aid to minorities at home and underdeveloped nations abroad
1574,accordingly politics becomes more genteel and has a better chance of becoming constructive as a main cause of internal dissension disappears
1575,it can be safely predicted that liberalism in an ethnostate would bear a much closer resemblance to the classical liberal­ ism of the 19th century than to the otherdirected intolerant hyperliberalism of the latter half of the 20th century
1576,the ethnostate designed and constituted to require minimal government would also exert a soothing influence on modern conservatives who in their contemporary incarnation are uncomfortable with excessive governmental supervision and control
1577,they are also tired of being accused of racism because they instinctively and without malice aforethought veer towards the manners and mores of the dominant popula­ tion group
1578,in a monoracial state they could hardly be charged with indulging in racial discrimination
1579,once the big guns of racism are spiked politicians would be restricted to arguing about nonracial matters
1580,under such favorable conditions a few government leaders might actually become statesmen
1581,since nothing is more wasteful of time and energy in con­ temporary politics than the constant sniping that goes on between liberals and conservatives even the slightest reduction in this noise level will be an immense boon to the art of gov­ ernment
1582,race and state
1583,in his book north and south an african journey shiva naipaul an asian indian from trinidad writes of blacks and whites in south africa both were rotten to the core
1584,each had been destroyed by contact with each other
1585,no one has described the effect of racial interfacing more bluntly
1586,the bosns envy of billy budds innate saintliness and physical attractiveness in herman melvilles novella resonates with racial undertones
1587,few authors have been more successful in delineating the ambivalent attitudes of the dark to the fair the nonwhite to the white the disadvantaged races towards the advantaged
1588,the comparisons subtly alluded to by melville the ethnostate 105 offer many clues to the revolutionary excesses of this and past centuries
1589,envy exists even when races are separated but not to the dangerous extent it reaches when races live side by side
1590,as max scheler has pointed out so forcefully resentment is at the heart of modem egalitarian doctrine
1591,a distinct trait of northern europeans is that so many of them are civilized nomads
1592,in viking days their ships were their homes
1593,today with their vacation houses and rvs they are a race whose roots are wheels
1594,after exploration migration conquest and settlement will they ever acknowledge that civi­ lization requires staying put
1595,like the life of an individual the life of a species or race has a beginning and an end
1596,like an individual a species should have a mission a reason for being
1597,the mission of the individual is to procreate to keep the species alive and kicking
1598,the goal of the species should be to fulfill its collective potential to prepare the way for an uptick in evolutionary grade
1599,a goalless existence is as static and un­ productive as death
1600,the combined intensity of the life of the individual and the group is the true measure of life
1601,leaders of an ethnostate should never allow its population to sleep to rest on its oars
1602,since it is easier to whip a homo­ geneous population into shape than to activate a mixing bowl of different and often mutually hostile races and subraces the dynamic states of the future are more likely to be ethnostates than to be motley empires and multiracial nations where so much human energy is dissipated in internecine feuding
1603,chapter 7 social progress an aristocracy of merit
1604,if we delve deeply enough into the etymology of aristos the best and kratos rule we can safely say an aristocracy that is not at the helm of the state is not living up to its responsibilities and is missing its rendez­ vous with destiny
1605,rule should be as integral a part of aris­ tocracy as best
1606,since western aristocracies are few and far between in the last decade of the 20th century and since where they do exist they cannot or will not rule it is fair to ask what is their raison d etre
1607,willynilly our modem aristocrats seem to have deliberately placed themselves in the vanguard of the wests march to degeneracy
1608,instead of ruling they furnish the worst sort of example by going somewhat faster than hoi polloi in scuttling the standards of morality and behavior re­ quired to keep countries in one piece
1609,roughly defined modem aristocrats tend to be people with some breeding and family lineage who consistently go public in the tabloids and gossip columns
1610,were it not for their resplendent family histories hardly anyone would ever hear of them and their infantile antics
1611,owing largely to the glamor accorded the wellborn by the media many less exalted folk are persuaded to imitate what they conceive to be aristocratic lifestyles
1612,the precious few aristocrats who do have a desire to avoid the limelight should be complimented on their modesty provided it is not a ploy to conceal their decadence
1613,no one who has not come down with brain fever or demo 106 the ethnostate 107 cratic dogmatitis should find fault with the statement that the rule of the best is the best of all possible rules
1614,the difficulty is how to provide the right political and social environment for the best among us to attain positions of leadership when the political version of greshams law is in effect
1615,the illiterate party enforcers the duplicitous fixers and the professional deal makers who claw their way to power in modem demo­ cracies may have a few virtues but their far greater number of vices generally includes an inordinate dislike of their betters which often metastasizes into plans for eliminating them as fast as possible
1616,once upon a time aristocracies arose from a warrior class
1617,to win vast estates in battle and have their possession con­ firmed by pope king or feudal lord demanded a large in­ fusion of physical courage brainpower and leadership capa­ bilities
1618,in one or two generations it was quite possible for the descendants of such outstanding men to become the genuine article functioning welloiled aristocrats
1619,classes and races are organisms as are human beings
1620,the two former simply run on a more extended timetable the life cycle of races lasting much longer than that of classes
1621,unfor­ tunately it does not take too many generations for aristocrats who are easily spoiled from birth to degenerate into the op­ posites of their ancestors
1622,since a hierarchical social order one of the chief prerequi­ sites of an aristocracy of birth is hard to find nowadays we must concentrate on preparing the way for that other category of rule by the best an aristocracy of merit
1623,in this endeavor the ethnostate could playa starring role
1624,multiracial states like all states democratic or authoritarian are ruled by elites
1625,when two elites are present in the same state at the same time a struggle for power is inevitable
1626,in a multiracial state the clash of elites is likely to be between elites of different races in ethnostates no such racial confrontations would be possible
1627,what is more the ethnostate offers little opportunity for the growth of several religious elites
1628,monoracial states tend to have a bare minimum of squabbling religious denominations and even universal religions and their various denominations 108 the ethnostate are usually ruled and directed by a raceconscious hierarchy
1629,because of the diversity of its elites a multiracial state is usually ruled by an in elite which differs significantly culturally and racially not only from one or more out elites but from large segments of the population
1630,the cultural discord arising from this situation soon becomes pervasive as those with entirely different customs and behavior patterns try to adopt or are forced to adopt the ways of the ruling elite
1631,nothing is a more effective promoter of dissension and civil strife than the elite of one race ruling masses of people of a different race
1632,an aristocracy of merit will help dampen mans traditional envy of privileged classesa justifiable envy when a decadent aristocracy of birth squanders its inheritance
1633,conversely only the most spiteful will resent those who have earned not been handed their generous rewards and perquisites
1634,a ruling class selected on the basis of achievement the bulk of whose members changes with each generation will be viewed entirely differently than a class founded on hereditary privilege
1635,with no racial differences and no petrified class structure the ethno­ state would give its citizens less cause for divisive infighting
1636,aristocrats being the traditional guardians of culture it is the duty and responsibility of the ethnostate to search out this special breed and make as many aristocrats of merit as possible out of its gifted citizens
1637,most aristocrats to the manor born would probably not get anywhere without the manor
1638,the aristocrat of merit needs help to acquire aristocratic tastes manners and tone as he works his way up the social ladder
1639,the cant factor
1640,whether we like it or not hypocrisy has been an important factor a sort of saving grace in keeping western civilization alive
1641,if we had really believed in and acted on the political fancies of prominent philosophers political scientists and religionists we should long ago have been reduced to perpetual anarchy
1642,an unstructured non­ hegemonic society cannot function over time any more than an army can put up a good fight without an officer corps
1643,whenever men even in small numbers get together or are the ethnostate 109 crowded together different gradations of power and influence quickly emerge
1644,people may be treated equally by law but in everyday life on the social plane where men both work for and against each other inequality not equality is the order of the day
1645,many of us believe or pretend to believe in the tenets of christianity and support various churches with our donations less frequently with our attendance
1646,at the same time how many of our thoughts and acts contradict christian doctrine
1647,we thrive on vengeance
1648,we covet not only our neighbors land but whole countries some of which we manage to conquer by a process snidely defined as pacification
1649,jesus commanded us to be meek but if we had been the kind of people to tie ourselves to apron strings we would never have crossed oceans to discover new worlds or soared into space to explore the solar system
1650,strange to say we should be thankful we say one thing and do another
1651,if we had followed the religious road map that laid out the shortest and surest way to heaven we would long ago have become lost
1652,setting impossible goals of saintly behavior seems to be a relatively innocuous habit
1653,what brings us down to earth is an instinctive red light that tells us when to stop sober up and get with it
1654,religion faith and creed propel us to the emotional highs that allow us to think more highly of ourselves to pretend we are better than we are or can ever hope to be
1655,if we did not indulge in these false selfassessments if we were not unbear­ ably hypocritical in our daytoday existence our ranks would be decimated by suicides and dominated by neurotics
1656,both the necessity and the opportunity for political religious and social preening would be diminished in an ethnostate
1657,it is generally a waste of time to put on an act in front of your neighbor to pose and attitudinize where your career and your character are both experientially and intuitively known to people who share your own racial and cultural background
1658,our reliance on hypocrisy to handle some of the more diffi­ cult social problems would quickly diminish in a milieu where frantic and exaggerated appeals to liberty equality and frater 110 the elhnoslale nity would no longer be needed to pump up an artificial spirit of community among disparate and often hostile population groups
1659,men and women living among their own kind need less urging to work together for the common good
1660,the medi­ ators ombudsmen and minority spokesmen who proliferate in heterogeneous societies would not have much of a calling in an ethnostate
1661,without the presence of these selfappointed social repairmen the citizenry would enjoy more domestic peace and tranquillity and suffer less domestic turmoil
1662,in view of the logic and common sense embedded in the concept of the ethnostate there is no particular reason why truth and straight talk would eventually eliminate much of the cant that obfuscates contemporary political and social dis­ course
1663,urbs and suburbs
1664,the descent into barbarism of many great western cities is the all but certain consequence of con­ fining a welter of different races in what amounts to an asphalt and concrete wasteland
1665,the further living conditions move away from the environment that human beings have been accustomed to for thousands of generations the more inhuman the environment and its occupants become
1666,increas­ ingly the inhabitants of large cities must resort to the school­ offish technique for survival
1667,by bunching up most are able to escape while the unlucky ones who find themselves on the periphery are picked off
1668,the modem city should not only be planned architecturally it should be planned demographically
1669,urban areas that wel­ come people of every culture and race stand a good chance of becoming ethnic battlefields
1670,in comparison the cities of ethnostates would be populated by the same kind of people that inhabit the suburban and rural areas
1671,racial friction should disappear practically overnight which means that a principal cause of urban violence would disappear
1672,what is more as a result of the high technology that now brings so many of the advantages of urban living to the most remote hamlets cities would no longer need to be as large and crowded as in the past
1673,the same conveniences that not so long the ethnostate 111 ago were only at the disposal of city dwellers are now available almost everywhere
1674,the dirt noise and flatout junglification of the late 20th­ century megalopolis can be avoided though perhaps only briefly by moving to the suburbs and beyond as tens of mil­ lions have done and continue to do
1675,but if the same pro­ portionate mix of races makes the move it will not be long before suburbia resembles the metropolitan racial miasma the escapees left behind
1676,the one effective answer to these waves of outmigration is monoracialism which assures that the in­ habitants of cities suburbs and countryside will be racially and culturally compatible
1677,the communications block
1678,the exponential advance of communications and transportation networks has made racial separatism harder to come by
1679,that a wide expanse of territory was needed to sustain man in the huntergatherer stage of human evolution ensured geographic distancing
1680,since this territory provided the wherewithal for life it had to be pro­ tected against poachers and other assorted trespassers
1681,the advent of organized agriculture made it possible for both invaders and defenders to live off the land they once fought for
1682,refugees uprooted by famine or conquest could be housed and fed
1683,today vast masses of people can move to western countries without missing a meal
1684,most will be well­ nourished and provided for until they settle down get jobs and in ever increasing numbers intermarry with their hosts
1685,the network of modern communications not only makes it possible to prepare for such population shifts it also con­ ditions the host population to accept migrants
1686,racial and cultural integration is accelerated by the medias refusal to explore racial differences
1687,men and women generally need 25 years or so of grammar school high school college and graduate school for a degree that qualifies them to take a comprehensive examination that if passed bestows on them the right to practice law or med­ icine
1688,dentists actuaries and commercial aviation pilots all must study and be tested for years before they can become 112 the ethnostate fullfledged members of their professions
1689,yet a television anchorman speaking to 15 or 20 million viewers five nights a week a man whose slightest vocal inflection may shape the opinions of a huge and credulous audience whose tossedoff comments and asides can have a profound effect on domestic and foreign policy may know next to nothing of the history of his own or for that matter of any other nation
1690,once he drops out of or graduates from college some of his species never even make it to college the anchorman never has to take an examination to test his knowledge of world affairs
1691,in fact his only qualification for his immensely in­ fluential job may be a leaning towards modem liberalism which may be prompted more by his wallet than by any real conviction
1692,add a dash of sex appeal and an obsessive ambi­ tion to be an overpaid celebrity and you have the brokaws jenningses and rathers of ad 1992 such a shallow and inappropriate background makes it difficult for anyone hired to report the news to really understand the news
1693,part ignor­ amus part windbag the anchorman has no qualms about fur­ ther slanting the already slanted material that streams across his teleprompter
1694,no occupation is more important in this age of instant glob­ al communications than that of the electronic journalist who can inch nations into war raise class and racial antagonisms to a boil and bring down presidents
1695,most tv newsmen knowing their power cannot help but let it go to their heads
1696,they have only contempt for the few critics who accuse them of not hav­ ing the foggiest notion of the consequences of their thought­ less reporting
1697,since he comments so often about economic issuys infla­ tion unemployment foreign affairs and the like it would only seem logical that the electronic journalist should know whereof he speaks
1698,we cannot expect him to have more than a sketchy knowledge of the physical sciences but surely if he deals with domestic politics and world affairs on a daily basis and if millions of his viewers accept him as an authority on a vast range of subjects he should have more than a passing acquaintance with economics history and political science
1699,the ethnostate 113 when it is suggested that television anchonnen foreign cor­ respondents newspaper columnists and editorial writers be required to demonstrate some knowledge of the issues they discuss so glibly when it is recommended that hey take a yearly examination or refresher course on the subjects on which they pretend to be experts they and their employers start referring to the first amendment
1700,is it chilling or killing free speech to ask that people in the news business prove they are qualified for their jobs as members of most other professions must do
1701,uneducated or undereducated mediacrats often try to hide their ignorance by emitting a smokescreen of democratic pi­ eties and platitudes
1702,they attempt to blur their axgrinding by describing it as adversary journalism which is better described as superficial journalism
1703,all too frequently news items are selected for their confrontational content instead of their importance
1704,the minds and voices predominant in such argumentative arenas are not disposed to get behind the head­ lines but to write them
1705,news that contradicts prevailing dog­ mas is often ignored because words often fail an ideologue forced to come to grips with facts that belie his ideology
1706,if we are intelligent why cant we act intelligently
1707,one reason is that too many people in the seats of power do not wish us to act intelligently
1708,it would throw sand in their modus operandi
1709,they want us to act in a way that may be intelligent to them but not intelligent for us
1710,progress for us will remain on hold until we learn how to get through to our own people and manage to bypass those who are dedicated to preventing us from getting through
1711,it all adds up to a problem of communications
1712,for some groups misin­ fonnation and disinfonnation are not faults or sins they are a way of life
1713,many of us are still so naive we refuse to believe that roundtheclock prevaricators do not have twinges of con­ science that the news twisters actually consider fudging the news a virtuea blow struck against the enemy
1714,crime prevention
1715,people are more hesitant to commit unlawful acts against their own kind than against outsiders
1716,114 the ethnostate they feel less guilty less consciencestricken about doing harm to someone not one of them
1717,this attitude helps ac­ count for the survival over the centuries of population groups that have traditionally cut corners in nations to which they have felt no particular allegiance
1718,certain crimes yield certain advantages to groups that com­ mit them on an organized and routine basis
1719,some of this dis­ regard for the social order may actually become congenital since it has worked to the advantage of selfish beneficiaries for many generations
1720,vociferous members of such families will point to the numerous times they have collectively suf­ fered for this aberrant behavior
1721,nevertheless these groups or gangs are still around in one form or another and still in business
1722,trial by jury may have arisen in part out of distrust for ones fellow man or more precisely one particular fellow man the judge
1723,several meninexpert in the lawwere deemed more trustworthy than lawyers who in olden days were both judge and jury
1724,some of this distrust was probably provoked by class divisions
1725,judges and the courtrooms retinue of attorneys not always deservedly have habitually loomed well above the ordinary citizen in the western pecking order
1726,in multiracial nations the jury can be a stumbling block to the criminal justice system rather than a neutral participant
1727,a juror of one race may be psychologically impelled to side with a defendant of the same race against a prosecutor of another race
1728,many millions of dollars and thousands of hours have been wasted in trials that have ended with hung juries that split along racial lines
1729,there will be no racially mixed juries in the ethnostate
1730,the court system will earn more public trust and confidence when judges prosecutors and defense attorneys are of the same racial and cultural background as the accused
1731,since there can be no racially inspired crime in a monoracial society no racial interference with the natural flow of the legal process will cloud the judgment of judge and jury
1732,looking into the future we might see a time when inorality the ethnostate 115 largely replaces legality
1733,a higher type of man one with a plethora of ethical strands in his dna need not be told what is right
1734,he should know what is right and be trusted to do what is right
1735,on that bright and promising day the legal profession and the judiciary basically parasites on the body politic might begin to close down
1736,no matter how loudly presentday criminologists may deny it or laugh it off crime has a direct effect on human evolution
1737,when violent criminals are freed after serving only a fraction of their jail time they have a greater chance of passing on their genes than if kept under lock and key
1738,to allow the carrier of the xyy chromosome a genetic marker for criminal ten­ dencies to have children is not a good way to lower the crime rate
1739,even the most zealous nurturist would agree that giving habitual criminals the freedom to reproduce occasionally with females who are also criminals does little to raise the quality of the worlds gene pool
1740,conservation
1741,no one should view the ethnostate concept more favorably than the conservationist
1742,the ethnostate will not only try to conserve all its flora and fauna it will also pay particular attention to saving that most endangered of all faunahomo sapiens
1743,the words conservation and conservative have a simi­ lar ring but a dissimilar meaning
1744,a conservative in todays vernacular is a freemarket supplyside small government advocate who when the chips are down puts the individual above the group even his own group
1745,modern conservatism has little in common with classical conservatism which gave race and culture a much higher priority than economics
1746,the little government leanings of most modern conservatives are a plus but their crass materialism and their pusillanimous refusal to discuss the race issue are a definite minus
1747,a conservationist seeks a proper balance between civilization and environment
1748,the love of nature is second nature to him
1749,he is more interested in clean air than in the good life of produce and consume
1750,if there is one person who should be in the vanguard of ethnostatism it is the conservationist
1751,116 the ethnostate mens sana in corpore sano
1752,medicine was once a holy profession
1753,in the presentday west it is largely in the hands of avaricious physicians v  o bank small fortunes while their patients line up like cattle to be prodded into prohibitively expensive tests and treatments
1754,some of this unmerited wealth is taken away by costly malpractice suits which enrich am­ bulancechasing lawyers and send insurance costs through the roof
1755,in the end however it is the patient who is the big loser
1756,races and subraces are predisposed to certain diseases and have different incidences of inherited defects
1757,the physician in the ethnostate would be able to concentrate on the sicknesses of his own people and would not have to specialize in the treatment of diseases often exotic diseases infecting people of different races
1758,the medical profession in each ethnostate can concentrate on the unique health problems of the citizenry
1759,such specialization accompanied by the allocation of ade­ quate resources should not only result in checking the spread of disease but go a long way towards implementing juvenals famous aphorism about sound minds in sound bodies
1760,the best mechanic for any particular type of automobile is likely to be the one who worked in the factory that manufac­ tured it
1761,the same may be said for those who are chosen to repair the human body
1762,the doctor most likely to be familiar with the health problems of his patients is the doctor who is their neighbor and shares their skin color
1763,the family doctor alas is long gone and the ethnostate may not be able to bring him back
1764,but it can offer the next best thing the doctor who knows and empathizes with his people
1765,as for diet which can work both wonders and horrors the peoples whose ancestors have lived on a specific territory for generations are best nourished by the food native to that terri­ tory
1766,over the centuries particular vegetables meats and grains have established a sort of healthy symbiosis with indigenous populations
1767,permanent changes of diet and complications caused by exotic or unfamiliar foods may produce harmful physical and mental aberrations that will take generations to assess and correct
1768,medical care is one thing providing expensive organ trans the ethnostate 117 plants to everyone who needs one is another
1769,the main goal of medicine should be to improve the health of people not to keep the terminally ill alive indefinitely
1770,by quarantining aids carriers by forbidding procreation to those with serious hereditary defects and by aborting the offspring of single welfare mothers the cost of health care for the overall population could be brought down to where allinclusive wombtotomb medical insurance would be affordable
1771,the population problem
1772,one of the more unsettling aspects of the modem era is the radically different population policies of the developed and underdeveloped nations
1773,the demographic strategy of the developed nations is to lower birthrates and prevent population growth
1774,the demographic strategy of most third world countries government proclama­ tions to the contrary is simply to breed with little or no heed to the future
1775,when these two different strategies clash as they often do in the multiracial nations of the west discord and disruption ripples up and down the state
1776,since the explosion of the black and hispanic population either through high birthrates or immigration is partly funded by welfare the number of those living on public handouts is constantly climbing
1777,as the ranks of white majorities thin in the western nations it becomes more difficult to resist the economic and political demands of the proliferating blacks and hispanics who maintain an irrational belief in the power of numbers
1778,the subsequent destabilization cannot avoid weakening the wests external defenses
1779,it is no secret that instability at home invites aggression from abroad
1780,multiracial states are not noted for longtime stability
1781,those undergoing significant population shifts in relatively short periods of time are arguably the most unstable of all
1782,there are few if any examples in history where large population groups of sharply different racial and cultural backgrounds living side by side in the same country have been able to pursue radically different population strategies peacefully for more than a few generations
1783,since it is politically impossible for democratic governments to enact laws that make failure to 118 the ethnostate reduce birthrates a crime there seems to be no painless way to reduce minority childbearing
1784,the mere suggestion that blacks in america and elsewhere should lower their birthrate to the present negative replacement level of whites would be denounced as a form of statesponsored genocide
1785,whites would be accused of attempting to cling to power by the mass murder of nonwhite babies
1786,governmentregulated birthrates are possible however in a monoracial state as demonstrated by recent legislation in china
1787,in mono racial states no racial resentment could be aroused on this subject because population control would affect only one race
1788,in china the onechild program conflicts with the traditional habit of the chinese particularly farm families to put a premium on sons
1789,if the only child is female parents are strongly motivated to ignore the law and try for a male
1790,the families that have only daughters bear a lot of resentment towards the marxist mandarins in beijing
1791,but the resentment is familial not racial
1792,today almost every country in the world is either overpopu­ lated or on the verge of having its population exceed its resources
1793,it follows that the population policies or lack of same of the underdeveloped nations and their migrant pop­ ulations in the west are spurs to ecological and demographic disaster
1794,one commonsensical way to stop this rush to chaos would be to reorganize the world into ethnostates which would eliminate many of the withinstate racebased objections to population control
1795,once the ethnostate rule of minimal foreign aid is in place proliferating populations would know in advance that their demographic transgressions
1796,would not be forgiven
1797,no more food shipments grants and loans from the first world would be forthcoming except in dire emergencies
1798,any attempt by the high birthrate nations to solve their population problems by exporting their human surplus would be prohibited by strict immigration laws
1799,because of disparate birthrates because nonwhite popula­ tions are expanding almost everywhere while white popula­ tions are diminishing almost everywhere the ethnostate offers not only a solution to the population problem but also a solu the ethnostate 119 tion to the growing disproportion of whites and nonwhites worldwide
1800,it is perhaps in this area the area of defusing the population bomb and rectifying the fertility imbalance of the races that the ethnostate could be of greatest service to human progress
1801,in multiracial states birthrates as indicated previously are often associated with the struggle for power
1802,it is hardly a surprise that birth control programs and family planning are viewed with suspicion by large segments of the population
1803,the sense of community which can be relied upon to encourage a racially and culturally unified citizenry to accept population control is never as strong and never as effective in a multiracial as in a monoracial state
1804,more important than human numbers is human quality
1805,one way of raising the average intelligence of a people is to get parents with high iqs to have more children than lowiq par­ ents
1806,in a multiracial state where iq scores vary not only among individuals but among races and subraces such a pro­ posal which would be damned from day one as hitlerian would arouse so much controversy it would be tantamount to political suicide to support it
1807,in the united states negroes and hispanics have disproportionately lowiq scores compared to whites and asians while whites of northern european ex­ traction have on average higher iqs than people of southern european extraction
1808,it is obvious that if highiq couples were persuaded to have large families the proportion of the north­ ern european and asian populations would increase
1809,owing to modem medicine welfare and differential birth­ rates the less intelligent are now surviving in greater numbers than the more intelligent
1810,if we ever reach the point where we can experiment with eugenics to compensate for the decline of natural selection as a means of weeding out the unfit ethno­ states would be ideal laboratories
1811,various types of population enhancement including eugenics could be tested and evalu­ ated in one or two ethnostates without worldwide repercus­ sions
1812,because many of the more ingenious theories of political science and mass behavior have seldom been tested under 120 the ethnostate properly controlled conditions they have usually remained just thattheories
1813,the ethnostate would make it possible to put some badly needed science into the social sciences
1814,using one or two ethnostates as testing grounds for new forms of government might do more to advance the human condition than all the books speeches manifestos and preachments of a thousand political philosophers statesmen and media mag­ nates
1815,immigration a topic previously discussed in this study is an important part of the population problem
1816,not only armies but individuals and families move across borders
1817,although the mills of the gods of genetics grind slowly it is undeniable that gene mixing is the most effective and irreversible form of cultural change
1818,when the gene pool changes the culture changes and when the culture changes the state changes
1819,any state or people that desires to preserve its racial and cultural inheritance should put heavy restrictions on immi­ gration
1820,xenophilia should not be the order of the day
1821,the influx and efflux of trade representatives diplomats educators reporters missionaries entertainers and refugees should be kept to a reasonable minimum
1822,it is the first law of race­ mixing that the more foreigners and aliens there are in a country the greater the rate of miscegenation
1823,because of the homogeneity of its people the ethnostate should not have to enact laws against intermarriage though abortion should be mandatory in the rare cases where mixedrace pregnancies occur
1824,as for childrearing which often fails disastrously in femaleheaded families pregnancies unaccompanied by a marriage certificate should not be allowed to come to term
1825,chapter 8 maverick economics the clash of class
1826,the most divisive man who walks the earth is the professional proletarian
1827,lauding and drooling over workers he heaps so much scorn and contumely on his bettersmanagers entrepreneurs achieversthat the ensuing class hatred is easily blown up into timewasting sit­ ins violenceridden strikes bloody street brawls even revo­ lution
1828,in short the class warrior though he pretends to be concerned with economic disparities lives and breathes the politics of envy
1829,unlike marxist and leninist proletarianism populism sits well with a homogeneous work force because it includes in its platform sharethewealth planks attractive to both blueand whitecollar workers who have become halfdeaf to cultural and patriotic appeals
1830,populism however can be counterpro­ ductive when it harps too long and too hard on soak the rich and capitalist conspiracy themes
1831,too much of this oratory only further divides a population group that has lost its way often at the very time it is most in need of unity
1832,hatred and envy for the superrich of ones own people especially for those who made their fortunes by money jug­ gling and speculation is understandable
1833,even saints have been known to resent those who have accumulated a large surplus of material goods with relatively little perspiration
1834,not many poor people being able to make it through life without blaming their penury on the system and without envying 121 122 the ethnostate those who are better off than themselves class agitators have an audience that is all ears and eager to listen to conspiracy mongers who specialize in splenetic spitefulness and inordinate use of the ad hominem
1835,in some respects it would be advantageous to have the leader of an ethnostate come from the upper classes
1836,notwithstanding his faults he would have a smaller residue of envy than someone from the lower rungs of the social ladder
1837,like it or not an aristocrat is often able to fascinate and attract working families with a style and tone that confer a metaphysical aura of leadership
1838,on the minus side he often has difficulty speak­ ing the average citizens language and understanding his ma­ terial and spiritual needs
1839,since it would eliminate the racial elements in class stratifi­ cation the ethnostate would not be overburdened with marxist and socialist disputations
1840,the money gluttons of wall street and hollywood would no longer be able to amass tens of mil­ lions of dollars for a few weeks or months of work while the genuine producers of wealththe manufacturers invent­ ors workmen and farmershave to sweat for their pay
1841,if the inheritors of great wealth and the accumulators of honest millions put themselves and their treasury notes certificates of deposit and giltedge securities to work not for the betterment of mankindthat limpid abstractionbut for the benefit of their own people they are to be saluted
1842,otherwise their unearned fortunes should be swiftly taxed away
1843,nothing destroys a hardworking persons morale faster than reading or hearing day after day about the decadent do­ ings of wastrels who devote most of their worthless existence to mimicking the ancient sybarites
1844,selfsufficiency
1845,the economies of the developed nations are so complex and so unfathomable that no one seems to have a clue as to what to do about the chronic waves of unem­ ployment the irresistible overspending and budget deficits the cyclic bouts of galloping inflation and in the case of the united states the enormous trade imbalances
1846,and all the while the developed nations overlend and the undeveloped the elhnoslale 123 nations overborrow
1847,tiptoeing warily through the uncharted minefield of finan­ cial hazards western economists habitually tum their eyes away from home fretting more about the world picture than about what is happening in the factory on the outskirts of town
1848,to them economics is little more than a spreadsheet of coded numbers which properly deciphered will lead the huddled masses into a promised land of eternal plenty
1849,a more realistic interpretation is that economics at its present stage can be compared to a watch that has so many parts it is never able to keep accurate time
1850,an ethnostate will have its own unique economy just as it will have its own unique literature art and music
1851,a global economy so much revered by free traders reduces and shrinks cultural differences by influencing countries everywhere to adopt the current western system of production and distri­ butiona system which tolerates and even encourages the economy of scale the bigger the company the quicker it can bankrupt its competitors
1852,the effect is to make the inhabitants of countries locked into this economic system imitate the cul­ ture manners and mores of the inventors and perpetrators of what has become a global economy
1853,the fact that people per­ form much better in an economy tailored to their own ways and predispositions is almost completely ignored
1854,the economic mess in the third world presents irrefutable evidence of the danger of inflicting alien work habits on in­ digenous populations
1855,the exploitation of some of the earths most precious resourcesminerals rain forests wetlands­ would never have reached its present extent if those whose re­ sources are being squandered had been allowed to solve their own economic problems in their own traditional way
1856,if economies do not have a racial and cultural underpinning they are ultimately lifedestroying instead of lifeenriching
1857,what makes the situation worse is that economics is that aspect of culture which can most easily stray across frontiers and become distorted and perverted
1858,the first step towards a viable economy for any state is self­ sufficiency
1859,the old watchword export or die should be 124 the ethnostate replaced by the more realistic maxim
1860,export and die
1861,if a state cannot manage to get along without depending on for­ eign products for its bare subsistence
1862,then its citizens will never really taste the freedom and attain the selfreliance that make for a fully rounded human personality
1863,the economy of ethnostates would be varied enough to give their citizens the broadest opportunities to learn and perform the many different tasks that lead to selfsufficiency
1864,the big­ gest deterrent to such a program is a onecrop or a one­ product economy
1865,which puts the entire economy at the mercy of some destructive microbe andor the vagaries of foreign competitors
1866,economics should be the science of effectively adapting the environment to the needs of varying population groups in varying geographical and climatic settings
1867,as alluded to ear­ lier
1868,economics is far from scientific and is barely more than a potpourri of often totally contradictory doctrines and dog­ mata
1869,economic selfsufficiency puts an end to the ageold game in which the country with lower wage scales and production costs takes over steals a large share of the domestic market of the less competitive country
1870,ethnostates with high wage scales and high operating costs would not have to erect high tariff walls or come up with large subsidies to protect their industry and agriculture
1871,a high priority on selfsufficiency and tight controls on both exports and imports would be enough to safeguard the home economy
1872,some ethnostates will be hightech
1873,some lowtech
1874,the lure of hightech products will always be a big problem to less developed societies
1875,to obtain the tv sets
1876,cars and kitchen­ ware the poor countries desire
1877,they borrow money they can never repay
1878,the only real and enduring solution is barterso much agricultural produce for so many manufactured goods
1879,and then only on a casebycase basis
1880,in the interim
1881,leaders of third world ethnostates should do everything in their power to persuade their peoples to acquire the knowledge and training to produce what they decide they cannot do without
1882,at the same time
1883,it does no harm to play up the importance of the ethnostate 125 lifes intangibles to those who have difficulty obtaining the tangibles
1884,high civilizations have existed without microwave ovens
1885,those societies which prefer metaphysics to physics intangibles to tangibles should be encouraged to concentrate on these preferences
1886,security from bullying by powerfully armed or fatwa1leted outsiders is the one gift that should be bestowed on less advanced and less affluent ethnostates
1887,regional or continental economic commissions should no longer be primarily con­ cerned with overcoming hindrances to the association of peo­ ples and states but with overcoming hindrances to dissociation
1888,autarky defined in the dictionary as a policy of establish­ ing a selfsufficient and independent state economy is a sus­ pect term in the globalists lexicon
1889,it should be an honored word in the vocabulary of ethnostatists
1890,economic indepen­ dence leads to a wellrounded state and to a wellrounded citizenry
1891,too much focus on occupation and occupational status can saddle a state with a caste system
1892,everyone in an ethnostate should have an equal shot at being what he would like to be
1893,but after getting that chance he should not be given it again and again only to fail again and again
1894,all the affirmative action and reverse discrimination in the world will not make a brain surgeon out of someone whose capabilities are strained by holding down a job as a trash collector
1895,state selfsufficiency brings with it an important boost in personal selfsufficiency
1896,a state whose economic existence is narrowly based on the export of one or two raw materials is likely to have a narrowminded onedimensional population and government
1897,garrett hardin one of the few truly imagina­ tive american social scientists has propounded this excellent rule never do anyone thing
1898,selfsufficiency at both the state and personal level mandates doing many things
1899,the leitmotiv of ethnostate economics should be thou shalt not overspecialize 
1900,no state should be forced induced or chivied into adopting another states economic system just as no state should be forced induced or chivied into adopting another states archi 126 the ethnostate tecture or music
1901,the word force as used here is meant to include dayandnight media bombardment
1902,the poverty factor
1903,the fixation of most presentday economists on distribution instead of production will hardly solve the problem of poverty
1904,taking from the rich and giving to the poor reduces investment and economic growth
1905,when it does raise the living standard of the needy it only raises it a fraction
1906,it is depressing to say but the politics of envy when injected into economics is far more alluring to demagogues and their minions than programs calling for tougher work standards and improved production facilities
1907,poverty it goes without saying is relative
1908,a black african who lives in a mud hut and owns a few animals is dirt poor by western standards
1909,by african standards however he may be fairly well off
1910,more important he may not feel he is poor
1911,a black in alabama who owns a latemodel car a half acre and a modest house crammed with worksaving appliances may complain bitterly of his straitened circumstances while his african brother would consider him a melanized rockefeller or rothschild
1912,the awareness of poverty which in psychological terms is synonymous with real poverty is a burning and divisive issue in a multiracial country where class differences are often equivalent to racial differences
1913,if such traits as prudence foresight and ambition were divided equally among races the poverty issue would arouse fewer emotions
1914,the science of genetics should be in the vanguard of the fight against poverty
1915,some of the mental characteristics that incite people to escape indigence are certainly inborn
1916,such genes could and should be more widely disseminated by encouraging couples that have exhibited traits for hard work and perseverance to have more children either by natural methods artificial insemination or some advanced form of genetic engineering
1917,but this must await the day when the masters of the media stop badmouthing eugenics arguably the most importantand currently the most suspect and most shunnedf all sciences
1918,the ethnostate 127 work habits and attitudes
1919,hides shells raw metal coins bank notes checks and credit cardssuch is the evolution of money
1920,electronic banking may be the nexttolast step
1921,after that according to some latterday marxists undismayed by all that has happened to their own dreamland will come the moneyless economyhouses food and other necessities will be passed out on the basis of need
1922,there is nothing terribly wrong with this idea provided the perks are also correlated to merit and job performance
1923,when everyone the shirker and the overachiever gets the same handouts when everyone develops the habit of receiving and not producing of taking and not giving soon there may be nothing to receive
1924,robots are fine in production lines
1925,they save workers from becoming robots
1926,if labor is reduced to one simple repetitious task or to one computerized operation in which every step of production from financing and procurement to manufacturing and sales is accomplished by zapping a few keys on a key­ board then people will have little left to do
1927,human intelli­ gence is already on the decline as iq scores and achievement tests clearly demonstrate
1928,it may well hit bottom if men and women run further and further away from challenges
1929,the brain of cromagnon man was bigger on average than ours because he had to exercise more brainpower to survive
1930,modem man at least in the developed nations need no longer worry about filling his stomach
1931,if he fails to do so by his own efforts it is filled for him
1932,the primary job of economics in an ethnostate would not be to increase living standards but to increase human standards
1933,citizens of ethnostates will not be encouraged to specialize until they have first become jacks and jills of many trades
1934,routine operations in the workplace render both the job and by extension the home a dull torture
1935,if work becomes less efficient when undertaken by workers who are somewhat proficient at perhaps a dozen tasks but are expert at none then so be it
1936,work should be attuned to the worker not the reverse
1937,the loss of manufacturing efficiency would be more than compensated for by the gain in physical and mental wellbeing of the producers
1938,128 the ethnostate the person to have doubts about is the one who tries to make a religion out of an economic system
1939,times change
1940,science comes up with new breakthroughs
1941,what suited a small country with a northern european population a century or so ago may be just the wrong economy for sri lanka in the 1990s
1942,free markets have a great deal going for them but they can lead to monopolies price gouging speculation inside trading massive bank failures and high rates of inflation
1943,they frequently give a green light to parasitic speculators who do not improve the economy but milk and bleed it
1944,a staterun economy in east germany worked poorly but far better than the staterun economies of other soviet bloc nations
1945,we all knowor should knowwhy
1946,economics has a strong racial component
1947,market economies have their good points but once they become internationally entwined defaulted foreign loans inflated currencies and trade disputes can ignite big and little wars
1948,the ethnostate which would keep a tight rein on financial adventurism should avoid such pitfalls as it adheres to the gospel that wealth should remain in the hands of its creators and in the land of its creation
1949,whether the promoters of capitalism agree or not central planning has been creeping into almost every phase and aspect of their hallowed economic system
1950,government agencies are as large and numerous in washington as they are in beijing
1951,centralization clearly did not produce enough material goods to satisfy the inhabitants of the soviet union
1952,but part of the
1953,fault was the economic nayvete of the russians themselves and the economic hocuspocus foisted on the wartom russian empire by the largely nonrussian four horsemen of com­ munism marx trotsky lenin stalin
1954,what it comes down to is that the slavic peoples have always lagged behind the west in economic matters which do not seem to be their forte
1955,when the slavs bestir themselves in noneconomic fields of activity they can be quite competitivein hbombs ballistic missiles spy satellites space exploration not to mention math­ ematics literature music the ballet and chess
1956,popular in times of prosperity capitalism and freemarket the ethnostate 129 philosophy lose a lot of their charm and voter support in eco­ nomic downturns
1957,it is quite possible as computers become more sophisticated and artificial intelligence software grows smarter that central planning and control will play an in­ creasingly important and perhaps positive role in the economy of every state including future ethnostates
1958,as man has learned to his sorrow fighting economic cycles seems as hopeless a task as fighting winter
1959,the wisest step that any economist can make at this stage of the game is to plan for spring
1960,all economic systems whether barter feudal cap­ italist or socialist have their exasperating periodic curves despite the best efforts of government planners central banks financial experts and tipsheet gurus
1961,economic swings offer great opportunities for politicking
1962,lean times are good times for demagogues and class warriors even though the busts as well as the booms have little or nothing to do with dark conspiracies of bloodsucking international bankers and car­ tels
1963,consumed by resentment at the highflying life of the jet set the malcontent never realizes that the sweetest revenge is to make the object of his envy envious of him
1964,but since this would involve a great expenditure of personal effort it is much easier to sit back and keep accusing rich folks of every crime in the book
1965,people work not only for money and subsistence
1966,they work because of a work ethic because of an innate impulse to work
1967,to provide for family and offspring is an inherited survival mechanism
1968,a high unemployment rate aside from the poverty which comes in its wake has a depressing effect on morale
1969,work at least for westerners is a means of getting man out of himself
1970,a man without work develops attitudes and feelings that can be extremely antisocial
1971,his dire finan­ cial straits are one cause
1972,but what really grinds him down is his inability to obey one of his deepest instinctsthe instinct to work for works sake
1973,capitalism pro and con
1974,some races or subraces have developed a fondness for laissezfaire others trend towards collectivism
1975,some are attracted to what is loosely termed 130 the ethnostate socialism others towards capitalism which comes in many shapes and models
1976,capitalism has a record of propelling many too many of the more capable and intelligent westerners into a mad scramble for riches
1977,these superior types might better have directed their superior capabilities towards other goals
1978,though some of the fault is due to heavyhanded intrusions of government latterday capitalism has had a significant in­ fluence on the breakup of families
1979,more and more mothers have to abandon their children to daycare centers in order to make enough money to keep the family in one piece
1980,iron­ ically the family is broken up in the day to keep it together at night
1981,in an ethnostate one of the primary aims of the economy would be to unify families and keep them unified by making it possible for mothers to remain with their offspring as long as necessary
1982,in preschool years the mothers continued presence is of vital importance to proper childrearing
1983,it is equally important that married couples incapable of bearing children have the opportunity if they so desire of adopting someone of their own race
1984,in a multiracial state minority chil­ dren crowd the adoption market which usually means that infertile couples if they wish to have a family often end up with a child whose race differs from their own
1985,one advantage of the socalled freeenterprise system is that it encourages people to be selfreliant to be inventive to go about their business with only a minimal bureaucracy looking over their shoulders
1986,most people will work
1987,more productively and more creatively when they have some input about the goals and conditions of their labor and do not have tyrannical bureaucrats or floor bosses riding herd on them the moment they punch the time clock
1988,those who lived through the great depression which occur­ red at the high point of the freemarket euphoria in the cap­ italist west did not find it an amusing experience
1989,six decades later no longer able to produce as much as they consume americans are again beginning to have doubts about their economy
1990,when the bills for all the mountainous borrowing the ethnostate 131 horrendous trade imbalances and bankrupting budget deficits come due capitalism will lose a great deal of its sheen though its most fervent supporters will blame the government not their cherished economic system
1991,yesterday
1992,when most westerners were doing fairly well it was two and a half cheers for capitalism and laissezfaire
1993,this sunny cheerfulness will quickly cloud over when 50 or 100 million westerners are out of work when soup lines are a mile long and when a loaf of stale bread costs a weeks wages
1994,a word about foreign trade
1995,free trade does not pro­ mote peace
1996,countries have gone to war only a few years after signing popular allembracing trade agreements
1997,since col­ lecting duties is one of the easiest and most lucrative ways for governments to fill their treasuries tariffs are more politically acceptable than import quotas or voluntary restraints
1998,free trade became a papu1ar icon after british entrepreneurs invented mass production and fired up the industrial revo­ lution
1999,since the british soon dominated world trade they decided they had nothing to lose by getting rid of their tariffs
2000,meanwhile a vast credit system which would have hardly been possible in an earlier time or in any other country provided the necessary financing for a quantum leap into a credit economy
2001,the united states would have industrialized much more slowly if it had not been for the protectionist wall it raised against the output of british factories
2002,the war of 1812 when practically all british goods were cut off was a godsend to american producers
2003,to the consternation of the freetrade advocates the era of high tariffs was an era of great us industrial progress and expansion 18801929
2004,after world world ii only the united states australia canada sweden and switzerland had what could be called an intact industrial infrastructure
2005,in 1947 the united states could boast of half the worlds gross national product most of the steel production and 80 of the automobile production
2006,forty years later japan and west germany were exporting more than america on a per capita basis proving that in some ways it 132 the ethnostate actually profits nations to undergo wartime destruction
2007,they are then forced to build new uptodate manufacturing fac­ ilities which quickly outproduce the older outdated plants of the victorious nations
2008,export subsidies beggaring thy neighbor and beggaring thyself artificially boost world trade
2009,fair trade often amounts to no more than telling other countries what they must do in the international market
2010,many trade problems would disappear in a world of ethnostates since economic self­ sufficiency shrivels foreign commerce
2011,the less trade the fewer the trade disagreements
2012,lower costs should not be the grand design of an economic system
2013,different countries have different wage scales
2014,to lose an entire industry as happened when japanesemade tv sets became the overwhelming choice of americans may have resulted in lowercost and higherquality products but it was not a free ride
2015,the market turnaround drove more american workers into lowerpaying service jobs thereby lowering living standards and assuring a less skilled work force in the future
2016,there is nothing fundamentally wrong with paying more for a product if the higher price is beneficial to society at large
2017,despite the bleak warnings of the free traders if a trade war keeps a substantial number of people ones own people from losing jobs then the war should be fought
2018,trade wars enable people to develop their own talents and resourcesat a price of course and generally at a higher price
2019,but the alternative may be the dispersal of the countrys production facilities and production skills to countries with lower wage scales
2020,should a western worker be forced out of a good job at a microchip manufacturing plant and be compelled to find employment in a fastfood eatery because korean computer firms pay their employees onefifth of what his american counterpart takes home
2021,he most definitely should not
2022,assume that a 75 foreign watch is slightly better than a 100 one made in the united states
2023,if people are willing to put their fellow citizens out of work to save 25 on a watch their country sooner or later will lose much of its export trade to foreign nations that offer lower prices not just for watches the ethnostate 133 but for hundreds of other products
2024,eventually this drain would seriously threaten any countrys economic health
2025,free trade in its worse aspects multiplies inequalities and deprives citizens of country a of the opportunity of being employed in industries manufacturing a product that has become a monopoly of country b which has a much lower wage scale and which may even have copied or stolen the product from country a people thrown out of work in coun­ try a are not casualties of trade war they are casualties of trade peace
2026,a north american continent in which ethnostates have sup­ planted a multiracial superpower might prove to be an eco­ nomic boon to all concerned
2027,not only would there be less labor turmoil because of the homogeneous workforces but the gnps of the different ethnostates might add up to more than the combined gnps of the us canada mexico and the central american countries before their metamorphosis into ethnostates
2028,just as a monoracial army would fight more bravely and stubbornly than a multiracial one all else being equal so a monoracial work force revved up by an esprit de corps could be depended on to work harder and better than a multiracial one
2029,international trade say the economic textbooks is the pro­ cess by which goods are provided by one country to another country which is deficient in such goods
2030,in return the pro­ viding country is supplied with goods that it is lacking or if not goods then the money representing the value of such goods
2031,ideally the value of what is exported annually should surpass or equal the value of what is imported annually
2032,but this is not the way international trade works
2033,many nations purchase much more than they sell
2034,some of them eventually welsh on huge debts accumulated by years of irresponsible buying on credit
2035,sooner or later the exporting countries will be compelled to swallow all or part of their losses
2036,sooner or later some big banks will go belly up and some currencies will be inflated into worthlessness
2037,then the economic confidence game starts all over again
2038,if the trade is interrupted for too long a period factory workers in the in 134 the elhnoslale dustrial nations will be out of a job and field hands in the countries that supply the raw materials will be idled
2039,to avoid or alleviate these consequences the international banking system endeavors to keep trade going by massive loans many of which will never be repaid either in part or in full
2040,the above demerits notwithstanding foreign trade continues to be a desideratum by almost all the worlds governments
2041,it is true that certain one crop nations have attempted to reduce their almost total dependence on foreign buyers by trying to build an industrial basemore often than not to no avail
2042,they find it much easier to keep concentrating on their one source of foreign revenue sugar for example in cuba and hope for the best
2043,the cubans prayed that the world price of sugar wouldnt fall
2044,if it should as it did they trusted an ideological ally to continue to pay a greatly inflated price as an underthetable subsidy for allowing their country to serve as a soviet military base
2045,when the ussr fell apart and the subsidy was cut back fidel castro had to order his peons to develop an autarkic economy pronto
2046,whether the castro regime will survive this crisis remains an open question at this writing
2047,whatever the outcome the shift in the direction of economic independence will eventually be helpful to cuba provided the islanders seriously wish to stop being economic puppets of foreigners
2048,the right economy for any state is one based on its own resources and skills which is to say that the surest guarantee of the states survival is its ability to produce enough food to feed its citizens enough clothing to clothe them and enough hous­ ing to house them
2049,at the same time it must have an industrial plant large enough to produce a minimal amount of simple manufactured products
2050,if these requirements cannot be met then the countrys existence is always at risk and its indepen­ dence more theoretical than real
2051,cynics may say it is both silly and presumptuous to demand that every ethnostate be largely selfsufficient
2052,they may be right in regard to high technology
2053,but not all ethnostates need to design and fabricate the fanciest semiconductor
2054,some will want high tech more for show than necessity
2055,others will try to the ethnostate 135 compete with the industrialized nations and succeed only to the point of accumulating a ziggurat of ious
2056,the world of tomorrow will have agricultural societies technoagricultural societies and hightechnology societies
2057,each ethnostate should try to fit its particular requirements to the capabilities and needs of its members capitalizing on their own special aptitudes and avoiding attempts to become politi­ cal and cultural carbon copies of people with different apti­ tudes and needs
2058,economic mimicry should not be viewed as a form of flattery but as an open sesame to decline and stag­ nation
2059,a favorable trade balance means that raw materials or manu­ factured goods have been shipped out of a country at a greater rate than comparable amounts of raw materials and goods have been imported
2060,a net loss of resources is inadequate compen­ sation for a net gain in currency
2061,economists will say that pa­ per money can easily be transformed into goods automobiles or supersonic bombers
2062,it can when the country printing the banknotes is presumed to be solvent
2063,in times of high inflation and economic distress when paper money loses most or all of its value people are forced to sell their valuables for currency whose buying power is declining at the rate of 50 a day
2064,protectionism we have been warned brings retaliation
2065,how­ ever even an outright trade war has its advantages
2066,countries will be less denuded of their natural resources
2067,some workers will lose jobs other will get new jobs as the domestic market is forced to expand
2068,employment will decline in the export busi­ ness but it will only be a onetime dislocation
2069,henceforth the economy will be focused on the domestic market which will enjoy a new degree of stability as it frees itself from the wild currency gyrations and price fluctuations in the world market
2070,the most dubious kind of trade is that which involves such irreplaceable and unrenewable resources as energy fuels and minerals
2071,the greater the amount of food produced the greater the use of pesticides and the greater the exhaustion of the soil
2072,the sale of agricultural products to foreign states is a financial gravy train for agribusiness but not necessarily for the small farmer who cant compete with foodgrowing con 136 the ethnostate glomerates
2073,when the soil becomes depleted and overworked prices will soar in the supermarkets
2074,the profits of american petroleum companies hit the ceiling when the united states was an exporter of cheap oil
2075,but if oil exports had been limited or forbidden america would have many times the amount of oil it now has would not be paying three or four times as much for it and would not be importing half its oil from overseas
2076,trade policy should not be based on shortterm profits but on its longterm effects on the living standards and security of the country in question
2077,the depletion of a states natural resources must be guarded against especially in times of economic crisis when politicians want to boost the economy by dumping precious reserves of strategic materials on the world market
2078,to put it bluntly there is no such thing as shortterm quickfix economics
2079,trade should not be subsidized as so much foreign com­ merce is today by export loans grants and other forms of financial aid
2080,this is not trade it is a form of economic leger­ demain developed for the mass transfer of goods food pro­ ducts and other assets from rich nations to poor nations
2081,many such shipments often fail to reach their destination and find their way into the homes warehouses and bank accounts of corrupt ruling elites
2082,the mere presence of these goods in­ creases the demand for more of the same thereby multiplying the importing countries dependence on foreign benefactors
2083,perhaps the 19thcentury austrian economist adam milller who advised banning the gold standard because it promoted international commerce was not as mad as modem economists make him out to be
2084,one of the great negatives of international trade however is not economic but aesthetic
2085,what is more depressing than to tum a comer in some colorful asian city and see on a wall beside the entrance to a mosque or temple a huge cocacola sign
2086,or to see a garish mcdonalds ad in the window of a pub in a quiet english village
2087,the americanization of much of the world though thankfully in decline has not been the result of american cultural superiority but of american eco the ethnostate 137 nomic clout
2088,like water spilling over a dam the culture of a powerful economy spills over into weak economies
2089,this in­ vidious attack on cultural autonomy can only be arrested by sharp reductions in foreign trade
2090,transnational corporations banks and any organizations or persons involved in inter­ national commerce are dyedinthewool opponents of cultural diversity
2091,whether they know it or not these free traders are working to establish a oneworld economy and along with it a oneworld culture
2092,though it may be hard to sell the idea to those who have been spoiled by a surfeit of material goods and worksaving devices the lack of a few creature comforts would actually raise the spiritual and intellectual level of a state when and if its citizens are forced to diversify their economy and rely more on their own talents and resources and less on foreign prod­ ucts
2093,foreign trade is dangerous to your cultural health is a solemn warning that should be drilled into the mind of every economist who should devote his brainpower to cutting down and eventually abolishing much of this trade rather than devis­ ing ways and means of increasing it
2094,if people want a taste of foreignness let them travel abroad
2095,allowing foreign firms to comer a giant share of the market in ones own homeland pushes the world a little closer to the aesthetic horror of global sameness
2096,toying with taxes
2097,with an efficient nationwide system of electronic banking once in place and with practically all trans­ actions handled by checks and credit cards there should be no reason why tax dodging and tax fraud could not be largely eliminated
2098,when all income and expenses are entered in computer data banks most tax forms could be eliminated
2099,collection costs would be reduced to a minimum a saving which could be translated into lower taxes for all
2100,the ultimate form of tax collection should be automatic withholding of all taxes on all financial transactions
2101,at that stage a great part of the huge taxcollecting bureaucracy would have no choice but to call it quits
2102,138 the ethnostate taxes are ideal weapons for shaping and managing economies
2103,differential tax rates can favor producers over nonproducers the working rich over the nonworking rich the artist over the agent the teacher over the entertainer
2104,dif­ ferential tax rates used to determine the nature and form of a society can be designed to bring out the best characteristics and capabilities of the members of that society
2105,ethnostates would end the taxexempt status of the churches of embezzling televangelists
2106,it would however be the general responsibility of government to see that au­ thentic religions have some form of economic protection
2107,in view of the racial and cultural unity of ethnostates it is probable that only a few religious denominations will exist in any particular ethnostate at any particular time
2108,in regard to foundations many of the largest were created for both noble and ignoble purposes to bring education to the masses to sprinkle largesse among the indigent and last but not least to dodge inheritance taxes
2109,today the billiondollar foundations have largely fallen into the hands of bureaucrats many of them minority members
2110,in the matter of the poor the disabled and the mentally ill their needs can be addressed more effectively by state agencies than by the sporadic and often uncoordinated efforts of private charitable organizations many of which are more interested in helping along the idiosyncratic ideologies of their directors than in helping the helpless
2111,financial flummery
2112,one great bane of modem economics is monetarism the brainchild of milton friedman
2113,monetarism permits bankers to hold a whip hand over a nations economy
2114,friedman is advocating controlling economic growth or de­ cline by keeping a tight grip on the money supply
2115,if prices rise too fast decrease the supply
2116,if production falls off print more dollars
2117,money consequently becomes a sort of eco­ nomic bed of procrustes as it abandons its principal pur­ poseto serve as a medium of exchange
2118,whereas inflation should be controlled by increased production and price com­ petition monetarism simply cuts down the amount of money the ethnostate 139 available which in tum slows and reduces production
2119,the problem is solved by creating a more serious problem
2120,this backhanded way of running an economy would be quickly ended in ethnostates the economic goal of which would not be growth or trade but to enable people to earn the wherewithal to maintain a decent standard of living
2121,mone­ tarism would go the way of keynesianism and all the other economic isms which have been tried tested and ultimately found wanting
2122,future generations of citizens would be given equal con­ sideration with the present generation in all the financial matters of an ethnostate
2123,this means that the borrow now default later policy of many presentday governments would be illegal
2124,no longer would debt be piled upon debt and interest payment piled upon interest payment all to be heaped on the children and the grandchildren of irresponsible fathers and grandfathers who burdened their offspring and descen­ dants with an indebtedness that could only be settled by massive default bankruptcy or massive inflation fraudulent payoffs with cheaper and nearly worthless currency
2125,here it might be enlightening to briefly call up some numbers that foreshadow what the future has in store for the united states
2126,at the end of fiscal 1990 the government was in debt to the tune of nearly 33 trillion
2127,when completed the sl bailout will cost no one knows how many billions
2128,on the tax front privately owned companies pay about 50 cents on the dollar of pretax earnings just to meet interest payments compared to 30 cents in 1980 and 10 cents in the 1960s fortune aug 27 1990
2129,despite these financial alarums congress cannot agree on legislation to effectively curb let alone stop this lemminglike rush to total insolvency
2130,accordingly it is a fairly safe bet that if and when ethnostates are carved out of the united states they will be founded on americas economic ruins
2131,brake on immigration
2132,dazzled by the riches of the indus­ trialized nations most denizens of third world countries want what they cannot produce and cannot afford
2133,loans and grants 140 the ethnostate help assuage their longings but these cannot go on forever
2134,the oil will eventually run out in those sheikdoms which are enjoying a temporary boom selling their irreplaceable natural resource
2135,when the wells run dry those few fortunate back­ ward nations who are currently and serendipitously in the chips will rejoin their less geographically endowed third world cousins
2136,the worst aspect of these economic imbalances is that it tempts third world peoples to migrate to the source and foun­ tainhead of all the
2137,riches the countries which with the excep­ tion of japan have overly altruistic if not slightly insane immigration and refugee policies
2138,the inflow of west indians asian indians and pakistahis into britain of north africans and blacks into france and italy and of turks and eastern europeans into germany introduces new racial and cultural frictions into countries still simmering with ancient ethnic and religious rivalries and hostilities
2139,these flowing rivers of immigration are fearsome menaces to domestic peace and tranquillity
2140,black riots in england and north african and 
2141,black riots in france are just a small indication of what can be expected later
2142,in the united states massive legal and illegal immigration of russian jews hispanics and asians continues to fuel the racial powder keg that is making life in many of the biggest cities a daily misery
2143,white flight offers some relief from this intolerable state of affairs but the migration is so disorganized haphazard and random that it would take an army of demographic experts to sort out the various popu­ lation groups for inclusion in future ethnostates
2144,westerners can hardly be blamed for enjoying the plenty they created
2145,but they should remember that this same plenty which acts as a magnet for nonwesterners may well be the cause of the wests downfall
2146,plenty may well tum into scarcity when nonwesterners take over much of the west by sheer force of numbers
2147,to make things worse there is absolutely no assurance that the people who could not make a go of it in their own homelands will do any better inor for­ their new habitats
2148,ethnostates offer at least one solution to the racemixing the ethnostate 141 problem by accenting the philosophy and politics of sepa­ ratism and opposing immigration
2149,by encouraging all popu­ lation groups to concentrate on their good points and make the best of their particular talents ethnostates would instill a pride of accomplishment and a measure of selfesteem in their citizens that would tend to keep them at home and put an end to their rushing off to western countries which may give them work but will never give them the feeling of belonging
2150,recapitulation
2151,one of the most salient economic issues facing westerners is the proper degree of government control
2152,leftwing and socialist politicians while putting distribution and marketing above production in their economic priorities continue to emphasize the immorality of unemployment and capitalist exploitation in their speeches and writings
2153,since these issues can hardly be solved by government indifference the mere fact of raising them must be regarded as proposals for increased federal control
2154,on the other hand when modern conservatives todays but not yesterdays apostles of decen­ tralization are elected to office their economic promises quickly founder on the rocks of practical politics
2155,the upshot is that most attempts to reduce government economic controls in western countries during the latter half of the 20th century have been largely confined to rhetoric and speechifying
2156,it is probably true that most westerners want some decentralization of their topheavy governments
2157,at the same time however they do not want any substantial reduction in government ser­ vices
2158,associated with rhetorical attacks against big government is criticism of central economic planning
2159,a principal argument of the decentralizers is the economic failures of socialist coun­ tries
2160,television constantly reminds us of the long lines in front of russian food stores and the lack of all but lifes bare essentials in communist societies or in societies recovering from communism
2161,the quasisocialist states of scandinavia are carefully omitted from these visual polemics
2162,how so
2163,quite simply because they have the worlds highest living standards
2164,when the attack shifts to scandinavian economies we hear 142 the ethnostate much about the lack of incentive the high suicide rate the confiscatory taxes but very little about food or housing short­ ages or free wombtotomb health care
2165,what economic successes the deregulationminded conser­ vatives have achieved while in or out of political office have been balanced by the troubling problems of eternal over­ borrowing
2166,deficit spending tends to increase rather than decrease under conservative leadership mainly because of tax reduction and the pusillanimous unwillingness of enough politicians of whatever ideological hue to cut spending and to put the economy on a payasyougo basis
2167,though economists are reluctant to admit it the failure of planned economies in the soviet union and its erstwhile satel­ lites in eastern europe and the third world could be attributed as well to racial and cultural factors as to central planning
2168,since this line of argument is generally taboo conservatives have been able to get away with blaming all the economic woes of the communist nations on their economic systems
2169,since these arguments are never properly answered the conservative explanation has become an economic axiom even for many western liberals
2170,as long as their stomachs are full people seldom vote for or support any serious economic change
2171,but when there is wide­ spread hunger and unemployment proposals for radical solu­ tions quickly climb to the top of the political agenda
2172,aban­ doning old approaches to problems however especially old approaches to economic problems does not guarantee pro­ gress
2173,fate seems to have decreed that no one economic system can run smoothly for long
2174,boundaries change wars erupt populations shift in numbers and in character
2175,new resources are discovered old resources are exhausted
2176,not even the most farseeing ingenious economic policies can cope with massive alterations in economic landscapes
2177,smallness is more of an advantage than disadvantage in nations undertaking economic reform
2178,in huge multiracial states the disharmonic interactions of regional economies make managing and planning the overall economy extremely difficult
2179,regions fight for their own local economic interests the elhnoslale 143 while the state triesand under such conditions generally failsto look out for the interests of all
2180,a regional economy is obviously easier to manage than a vast state apparatus sitting on top of several competing regional economies
2181,one region may want high tariffs another may want free trade
2182,one may be agricultural another industrial
2183,there is not much that government can do to draw these incompatible economic fact­ ions together
2184,for most of human history people no matter what form of government they lived under were on their own
2185,their lives and livelihoods did not depend on incoming shipments of food manufactured products or raw materials
2186,the present state of affairs in which the survival of large numbers of peo­ ple and even nations hinges on lines of communication thou­ sands of miles long is quite dangerous as has been amply demonstrated by wartime blockades and peacetime embargoes
2187,as stated previously international or interregional trade would diminish in a world of ethnostates
2188,certain minerals and natural resources certain foods and grains that are region bound will obviously be factors in foreign commerce for some time to come
2189,but since agricultural science and the tech­ nology of synthetic materials are not standing still even the smallest and poorest ethnostate might soon be able to produce a great deal of its basic needs within its own borders
2190,as people eventually work out their own culture so if given the chance they will work out their own economy
2191,notwith­ standing the theories of modem economists human behavior exerts more influence on economics than vice versa
2192,new approaches
2193,the future offers us unlimited time to devise better and more advanced economic systems than those denominated by capitalism and socialism
2194,none of these sys­ tems has eliminated poverty none has provided all its citizens with adequate housing and nutrition none has eliminated the economic causes of war
2195,all have revoked in one way or another what should be the fundamental right of all responsible and intelligent adult human beingsreasonable access to capital
2196,144 the ethnostate the overbureaucratization of the economic sector would pose much less of a problem in ethnostates than in other forms of government
2197,fewer factions and pressure groups will be available to put conflicting demands on the economy
2198,the cooperation necessary to fulfill economic goals will be greater for the obvious reason that a homogeneous population pulls together better than a heterogeneous one
2199,since both capitalism booms busts inflation and socialism petrified centralization have exhibited many depressing ex­ amples of failure both could stand some overhauling
2200,despite the rote protestations of freemarket buffs there is no reason why an intelligently run economy cannot offer more equitable work incentives than oldfashioned toothandclaw capitalism does
2201,at the very minimum it can stop once and for all the gross unfairness of an ignorant illiterate young singer with a thirdrate voice earning more money in a week than a grade­ school teacher earns in a lifetime
2202,it would also end a financial system that permits even assists a junk bond impresario to make hundreds of millions of dollars in one year by saddling once profitable companies with mountainous debt
2203,it would also make it possible for speculators in coal mine stocks to make more in a few days by buying or promising to buy a few pieces of paper than a miner can make in thirty or forty years of dangerous backbreaking drudgery in dustfilled molelike foulsmelling tunnels hundreds of feet below the earth
2204,no amount of praise for adam smith and milton friedman no amount of effusive references to the glories of free enterprise can justify or excuse such disparities
2205,although free marketeers will stoutly deny it irresponsible financial speculation can be prohibited without ending legiti­ mate risktaking and investment opportunities
2206,similarly the economic dogmatists of the far left must outgrow and abandon their belief that private property is theft and that private owner­ ship of the means of production is synonymous with exploita­ tion
2207,putting aside nuclear war an attack from outer space and worldwide famine and plague the greatest threat to economic evolution is probably the decline of intelligence
2208,if this evo the ethnostate 145 lutionary deadend can be avoided there might be no limit to economic progress
2209,masses of accurate economic data can eliminate much of the waste that has bedeviled human endeavor through the ages
2210,the enormous power of high technology if given the task of solving economic problems could usher in a semipermanent age of plenty
2211,in fact so much economic progress might ensue that an entirely new danger could present itself
2212,how would human beings whose lives throughout most of history have always been threatened by war disease hunger and violence cope with a radically new type of existence in which most of mankinds traditional problems have been overcome
2213,the psychological impact wouid be unsettling even perhaps un­ hinging
2214,the most disturbing factor would probably be the combination of too much leisure with too much security
2215,one way of avoiding the dangers of this utopian lifestyle might be to transform all that leisure into productive hobbies so that everyones spare time would be concentrated on purposeful projects
2216,but no matter what problems crop up by eliminating some of the principal deterrents to human achievement the chances are that mans builtin adaptiveness and flexibility would eventually come to his rescue and allow him to reaffirm his lordship over the broadest range of environments
2217,chapter 9 educational benefits mind broadening
2218,one means of getting at the biology of culture is to examine the effects of tolerating parasitic growth
2219,institutions soften when their creators soften
2220,a splurge of laws to protect minorities from discrimination is a sign not only of changing times but of changing demographics
2221,being human we all have roughly the same cerebral appara­ tus
2222,being of different racial strains we use and apply our brains in different ways
2223,no matter how our genomes read almost all of us are capable of acting and thinking logically and illogically
2224,certain population groups following their inherited tastes play up the arts to the detriment of the sciences
2225,others take a different path
2226,how many young people have been induced by their peer groups and perhaps even by their churches to believe there is something sissified about art
2227,conversely the student who flunked his first science course may lose all interest in mathematics physics and chemistry for as long as he remains in school or college
2228,because of trifling classroom setbacks such as an inadvertent c or d millions of adults will never read a serious book once they finish their education
2229,other millions after a sad experience in vocational training will never dirty their hands trying to repair a leaky faucet or change a tire
2230,not many of us have both the show me attitude of the fictive missourian and the ability to compose or appreciate serious music
2231,favoring the arts to the extent of shutting out the sciences or having the reverse preference is 146 the ethnostate 147 living half a life
2232,although their brains have two hemispheres all too many people choose to utilize only oneeither the right hemisphere the factory of the imagination or the left the empire of empiricism
2233,in such cases personalized education can come to the rescue and exert strong constructive influences on human develop­ ment
2234,all our mental capabilities in both cranial hemispheres can be brought into play with some extra attention instruction and coaching making possible a vastly richer intellectual life
2235,every student of every race would benefit from programs designed to awaken all the powerful resources that lie dormant in the human brain resources that may never come to light in the confusion and chaos of a heterogeneous educational sys­ tem
2236,the artscience dichotomy is not a hard and fast detenninant of the bias or tilt of the human personality
2237,no one need be a cranial prisoner of the right or left hemisphere
2238,there is noth­ ing schizoid or weird abput using both parts of the brain alternatively or simultaneously
2239,for examples of the extremely proficient use of both one thinks of pascal and goethe
2240,the teachers and professors in an ethnostate infused with the same culture as their students will have much less trouble passing this culture on
2241,in multiracial educational institutions a great deal of instruction time is wasted watering down the curriculum and endlessly repeating the lessons to make them understandable to everyone
2242,teachers must be constantly on guard against minority students taking offense at whatever might be taught or said in class
2243,when one pupils hero is an­ other pupils devil as so often happens in multiracial class­ rooms eg columbus all heroes tend to be dethroned except perhaps some historic figures who are less than heroic but who are praised in order to heighten the selfesteem of minority students
2244,with the possibilities for racial infighting removed teachers in an ethnostate will no longer have to spend much of their time on the disciplinary problems that plague racially mixed schools
2245,equally important they will no longer have to con­ duct courses on esoteric cultures about which they know little 148 the ethnostate and which they appreciate less
2246,before students are taught about other peoples and cultures they should first learn about their own
2247,the classrooms in every ethnostate will be filled with the children of that ethnostate and no other children
2248,the students would learn with each other and from each other
2249,only at the higher stages of education would the students of one ethnostate learn about the people and culture of other ethnostates
2250,when the oracle at delphi told the pilgrim know thyself the advice was right on track
2251,two and a half millennia later it still remains the allimportant first step in education a step which is being bypassed in the multi racialism and multi­ culturalism which now holds sway in american schools where the practice is to teach most white pupils a great deal about other cultures but not a great deal about their own
2252,educational aims
2253,race is felt seldom taught
2254,if taught it is seldom understood
2255,if understood its power for good or evil is awesome
2256,once they have come to terms with their own racial feelings men and women will come to know the importance of understanding and respecting the feelings of other races
2257,to understand ourselves we have to understand both the inner and the outer selfthe genetic self and the environmentally condi­ tioned self
2258,today what knowledge we have of these matters is largely focused on the environmentally conditioned self mainly on that part of the individual which is probed unscientifically loosely and often irresponsibly by psychiatrists psychologists and psychoanalysts
2259,this probing leads more often than not to the misunderstanding of self
2260,meanwhile the genetic prob­ ing is generally limited to detecting hereditary illnesses or defects either before or after birth
2261,the ethnostate since it puts so much emphasis on the rela­ tionship between the individual and the group will stimulate the study of the genetic self genes being the chief determi­ nants of both individual and collective behavior
2262,when foreign peoples and cultures are studied the instruc­ tors aim should be to identify their differences along with the ethnostate 149 their similarities
2263,a nonchinese does not study chinese art to become a chinese artist or adopt a chinese art style but to learn about chinese art
2264,knowledge of foreign cultures helps us know more about ourselves
2265,but all intercultural studies should be approached as a biologist approaches a microscope
2266,by studying simian chromosomes he does not seek to become more like a monkey
2267,it is in this spirit of olympian detachment that all education which does not apply directly to the students own culture should be undertaken
2268,it is possible to appreciate french liter­ ature without becoming a frenchman
2269,in fact acquiring a knowledge of french literature under the guidance of an intel­ ligent teacher increases ones appreciation of ones own litera­ turenot the other way around
2270,it should be emphasized and reemphasized that the main purpose of all crosscultural stud­ ies should be to obtain a greater appreciation of ones own culture
2271,since the population of ethnostates will be homogeneous racial integration at the school level one of the great sore spots of modem learning will no longer be an issue
2272,whatever segregation that still persists in education would be based on educational preferences aptitudes and capabilities
2273,one obvious goal of education is to prepare students to become cooperative and constructive members of society
2274,education begins in the family continues in the school and as the case may be goes on to college and beyond
2275,formal education ends when the individual begins the career for which his years of schooling have prepared him or more commonly in these confused times unprepared him
2276,informal education should only end with death
2277,a full life calls for constant men­ tal expansion
2278,since ethnostates would differ education in ethnostates would be tailored to these differences
2279,just as each ethnic groups educational requirements vary so does each groups educational capabilities
2280,educators should be committed to raising every student to the limit of his learning potential tak­ ing into account the wide variances in such potential in both individuals and groups
2281,no one should be undereducated but 150 the ethnostate overeducation for those with limited capacity to absorb certain curricula can lead to serious psychological damage
2282,a college student who barely graduates and then finds his first job too difficult to handle may be headed for a lifetime of frustration
2283,he has been prepared for a level of work that he can never properly perform
2284,along with his unmerited degree comes a lifetime of unrealized hopes
2285,students in an ethnostate would be taught more about their virtues and less about their vices
2286,in multiracial schools when whites are discussed the emphasis is generally on their sins not their good points
2287,education should always contain an optimistic note and be treated as the introduction to a great adventure
2288,dryasdust teachers and professors ought to be swept out with all the other educational cobwebs
2289,since humans of every shape and size have adapted to very diverse circumstances and conditions in the past they should be able to take the most radical changes in education in their stride
2290,our forebears especially our northern european forebears have been guilty of many sins but not the sin of mental sloth
2291,gifts for the gifted
2292,breaches of discipline vandalism crime and classroom violence being considerably less of a problem in a monoracial educational system educators in an ethnostate could finally get back to the business of teaching
2293,the results should be phenomenal
2294,public schools would have the oppor­ tuni ty to harvest large crops of aristocrats of merit since they will no longer be deprived of the children especially the gifted children who were sent to private schools to escape the chaos of school desegregation
2295,i1iblic schools also would be able to seek out talented white students with the eagerness that non­ white students talented and untalented are now sought out by multiracial schools
2296,recognizing and even celebrating human differences each ethnostate would encourage students to capitalize on both their collective and individual distinctiveness
2297,educators would pick up on this theme and let race out of its academic prison
2298,anthropology is a science
2299,biology is a science
2300,genetics is a the ethnostate 151 science
2301,species phyla and other categories of living things have an honored place in education
2302,man would have the most honored place of all
2303,consider the gifted schoolchild whose academic perfor­ mance is well above average
2304,the presentday western attitude towards him at least when it is publicly expressed is largely indifferent on occasion even hostile
2305,highly intelligent stu­ dents actually become targets of the media and are often put in the same unpleasant social slot as smartaleck playboys
2306,in­ stead of organizing courses so their more intelligent pupils can move forward at a faster pace presentday educators are often content to let them sit and vegetate in the same classroom with average and belowaverage students
2307,the results are hopelessly counterproductive
2308,the gifted stu­ dent compelled to study and restudy what he already knows may permanently lose all interest in learning
2309,the lowiq stu­ dent forced to compete for grades against more active minds will always come out second best
2310,the ensuing frustration is one of the chief causes of the alarming dropout rate in high schools and colleges
2311,just as the mentally handicapped need special education so do the mentally advantaged
2312,the talents of gifted pupils can be shown to best advantage by putting them in classes where they have to compete with their intellectual equals
2313,in accelerated courses their brains are kept at a boil and remain unaffected by the dull torpidity that permeates so many contemporary classrooms
2314,the extra attention expended on the slow learner is often impractical
2315,his innate disabilities simply cannot be overcome by any remedy short of genetic engineering
2316,for students with superior intelligence the sky is the limit
2317,the extra work and attention dedicated to their education is worth every extra dollar and every extra hour
2318,the more that is done for them in school the more they will be able to do for their people when they finish their education
2319,gifted blacks relatively few in number do little to improve matters since they are immediately siphoned off to the most prestigious private schools and universities thereby denying 152 the ethnostate these superior educational opportunities to equally qualified whites
2320,the average black his ranks thinned by the removal of the intelligent members of his race does more poorly in class than ever while the gifted white his chances for a better education reduced by racial quotas and lower classroom stand­ ards may compensate for the unfair treatment by retreating into an obsessive antiblack racism that will hound and distort his thinking for the rest of his life
2321,different population groups absorb lessons at different speeds
2322,their learning clock ticks at different tempos
2323,edu­ cation has failed so miserably in multiracial states because pupils of all population groupswhite brown and yelloware subjected to one statewide in many cases one nationwide curriculum
2324,no such educational mismatching will occur in an ethnostate
2325,homogeneity automatically solves one of the great drawbacks of modem educationforcing children of varying racial and cultural backgrounds into the same educational mold
2326,testing
2327,an individuals school performance and work resume are fairly reliable records of his abilities
2328,but even after being out in the world and working at one or more jobs many persons need five to ten years more to find their niche in life
2329,a wellconceived battery of iq tests motor reaction measure­ ments reaction time to various stimuli such as flashing lights and moving objects and personality assessments can some­ times find the right career for men and women in a matter of hours
2330,the results from such tests direct testees to the occu­ pation or occupations where their talents can be put to the most effective use both for themselves and for the citizenry at large
2331,the basic argument against such tests especially tests designed to measure intelligence is that they assign individ­ uals often irreversibly to permanent categories of capabilities and aptitudes
2332,if they are accurate that is exactly what these tests should do
2333,critics of testing on the other hand assert that members of certain ethnic groups have been conditioned by their history slavery for example to do worse than the rest of the ethnostate 153 the population
2334,if this hypothesis is correct it is one more compelling reason why separate educational systems should be taken seriously
2335,separate schools for different population groups would go a long way in eliminating environmental and genetic objections to tests because those tested would be of similar racial and cultural backgrounds and would be taking tests devised by their own people
2336,the opponents of intelligence tests admit albeit reluctantly that iq scores vary with race
2337,the average for whites is 100 for blacks 85 for asians a few points above 100 within the white population average iq scores also vary
2338,largely for under­ standable reasons not much publicity has been given to such research
2339,one or two tests have shown that northern and northwestern europeans and their descendants overseas have the highest iq scores of any race or population group
2340,opponents of intelligence tests dont and wont admit that the causes of the variations are largely innate
2341,admittedly iq critics have a point
2342,a highiq score is not an ironclad guaran­ tee of a successful career
2343,a finely tuned motor is a nice piece of machinery to have under the hood
2344,but to get the most out of the car a trustworthy driver is needed
2345,a clean highoctane gas morality perseverance and health also helps
2346,to obtain a fairly complete profile of anyone much more than intelligence and achievement tests are required tests for genetic and psychological defects tests for attitude concentra­ tion feeling taste control moral balance and tests for the many other physical and mental traits that constitute the marvel of biological complexity known as man
2347,many such testsseveral correlating fairly well with iq scoreshave already been devised among them the motor reaction mea­ surements mentioned previously and most notably the multiple personality tests developed by raymond cattell
2348,test scores should be guarded like state secrets
2349,advertising low scores injures the ego of low scorers and gives high scorers exaggerated opinions of themselves that can only be con­ firmed by successful careers
2350,in any case test scores are not foolproof predictors of future success in school or in the job market
2351,154 the ethnostate falling standards
2352,while on the subject of education it should be kept in mind that at the high watennarks of western culture only a small percentage of the population 8  in gennan lands in goethes time was literate
2353,but education is not a matter of percentages
2354,in some ways a literate westerner of the late 20th century is less educated and less cultured than an illiterate 17thcentury european peasant
2355,now that several western countries but not the united states boast of the 100 literacy of their adult citizens it is nevertheless doubtful that more than 50 are able to understand let alone enjoy the lit­ erary classics that enchanted their forefathers
2356,a much smaller percentage appreciates the output of modern writers painters sculptors and composers who seem to go out of their way to divorce themselves and their work from ordinary people
2357,two or three centuries ago analphabetic english laborers could un­ derstand passages from shakespeare when they were read out loud or when they heard them at the globe theatre
2358,nowa­ days many educated westerners have difficulty reading shakespeare and would much rather tune in a lowly television sitcom than a beautifully stylized bbctv production of king lear
2359,the lamentable state of the study of american history has been glaringly illustrated by a national endowment for the humanities poll october 1989 which found that 24 of the college seniors responding thought columbus discovered the new world after 1500 34 believed the pilgrims signed the magna carta and 40 were convinced that the emancipation proclamation was the work of the constitutional convention 1787
2360,such is the educational level of college seniors not innercity dropouts
2361,with more young black males in prison than in college those most in need of education are wasting precious years in crowded cells as their young brothers bring their street culture to school and turn classrooms into quasijungles
2362,everyone of every race is the loser most of all the blacks whose antisocial behavior and learning handicaps are a basic cause of the problem
2363,as the number of unassimilable minorities increases in every the ethnostate 155 western country demographics alone makes school desegre­ gation much more difficult
2364,in the united states forced busing has put an unbearable financial load on many public school systems
2365,the heavy concentration of minorities in inner cities works effectively against integration with the result that segre­ gation is now more common than integration in most metro­ politan public schools
2366,what necessity and simple demo­ graphics command courts have a hard time overruling
2367,the current trend is back to segregated classroomsand there seems to be little that dedicated desegregationists can do about it
2368,more than a few black educators having given up on inte­ grated schools are trying to replace distraught female teachers white and black with black males
2369,they claim correctly that since most black children are brought up in femaleheaded families they have had little contact with men
2370,some psychol­ ogists believe that the lack of black male role models in and out of the classroom is one reason for black educational fail­ ures
2371,although this claim mayor may not be true what is true is that an obvious first step in solving the problems of black edu­ cation and the equally serious problems encountered by whites in integrated schools is the separation of races
2372,black frustra­ tion over failure to compete scholastically with whites would end because the competition would end
2373,the egos of minority members could be fed with inflated history without deflating white history
2374,many other disadvantages of racially mixed stu­ dent bodies such as the incessant racial bagarres in and out of class would become no more than disturbing memories
2375,higher education in the hard sciences should only be avail­ able to those who qualify
2376,to become a physicist chemist or engineer in the presentday united states talent is not infre­ quently a less important qualification than being a black or an hispanic though it is precisely the members of these two cate­ gories who on average are least capable of doing well in such disciplines
2377,in an age when science and technology hold all the trumps in warfare the brightest asians arabs and europeans are jam 156 the ethnostate packing physics chemistry and engineering courses in ameri­ can institutions of higher learning while qualified whites are cheated out of scientific careers by exploding tuition costs and by quotas which permit less qualified minorities to attend the nations best universities often on fouryear scholarships
2378,be­ cause racial discrimination in higher education falls dispro­ portionately on white males fewer of them enroll each year not just in scientific graduate schools but in all graduate schools
2379,philosophical pathways
2380,if we had been privileged to stroll through the groves of academe in ancient greece with a philosopher like plato who assigned a high priority to ethics we might have heard him suggest that the most effective way to influence people to live moral lives was not to teach or preach morality but to persuade them to breed morality
2381,a bad envi­ ronment stimulates unethical behavior
2382,but so do bad genes
2383,the jukes family saddled america with six generations of criminals
2384,to improve our moral caliber we must first improve man himself
2385,the outer man despite the claims of psychoanalysis is a fairly close reflection of what goes on inside
2386,providing better sets of genes by genetic engineering and halting the transmission of criminal traits by sterilization are two means of promoting moral behavior that should prove more effective than the ten commandments
2387,philosophers come in all shapes and sizes idealists logical positivists ontologists empiricists and existentialists to name a few
2388,westerners have even had the opportunity seldom seized to read the works of a few philosophical anthropologists since midcentury
2389,but where are our philosophical geneticists the deep thinkers who ponder not on the eternal forms of the soul but on the forms of those astounding almost invisible human templates called genes
2390,they may combine and recombine and multiply and divide but as long as one organism remains on earth some genes will remain
2391,the same genetic material that lived in the cells of cromagnon man is living in his modem descendants
2392,we talk a blue streak about immor the ethnostate 157 tality without ever having produced a single piece of credible evidence that such a boonor curseexists
2393,yet our bodies are overflowing with an estimated 100000 genes which if we have children will
2394,survive in them and in their childrens children and so on down the chain of generations
2395,this may not be conscious immortality but it is immortality of a sort
2396,genes are minuscule design factories whose production lines would be quite busy in a world of ethnostates
2397,the one world so dearly desired and endlessly touted by liberals and egal­ itarians would greatly reduce the variety of human genes both dominant and recessive as the human population amalgamated into one race
2398,in any event the continuity of the human race would not be at stake unless the doomsayers of nuclear winter are right and an insane lapse of statesmanship fulfills their grim forecasts
2399,the question of a monoracial or multiracial fate for man is a madetoorder subject for modem philosophers though we hear hardly a peep out of them on these vital matters
2400,the philosophers of previous centuries did not have the technical expertise to assess the genetic benefits of an ethnostate gen­ etics being a study well beyond their reach
2401,modem philoso­ phers on the other hand while they have a mass of newly ac­ quired scientific knowledge at their disposal show little interest in addressing questions linking genetics and statecraft
2402,having spent much of our shrt existence riding on a philo­ sophical merrygoround
2403,only rarely do we catch a brass ring
2404,that things are different from what they seem rouses uslike it roused the ancientsto dig deeper into the enigma of exis­ tence
2405,no matter how far we dig however what we perceive will ultimately be channeled into our senses
2406,when there is a wide gap between the phenomenon and the noumenon be­ tween the real and the apparent size of the sun our senses can be overridden by instruments and reason
2407,in most acts of per­ ception however the brain remains the prisoner of our senses
2408,even if we cannot directly observe objects as small as genes we are ready to concede their existence
2409,bishop berkeleys ideas are no longer in fashion
2410,the instruments designed to probe inside the chromosome 158 the
2411,ethnostate and to expand our vision to the outer limits of space the elec­ tron microscope and the radio telescope never cease to amaze us with new discoveries
2412,if man had selectively bred for sharp­ er vision over 50 millennia some of us might now have the builtin eye power to perform such visual miracles
2413,but now that extreme nearsightedness has been achieved technically optical darwinism would serve no real purpose
2414,our senses being our main conduits to the empyrean realm of thought even in this day of atomic measuring and infrared photography our gut perceptions cannot be easily dismissed
2415,nevertheless it is time to put a stop to this senseless an appro­ priate adjective
2416,bickering over appearance and reality
2417,in sci­ ence there is the measured and the measurer as in philosophy there is the thought and the thinker
2418,we live in a world of complementarity
2419,some day we may be able to identify the different matrices of neurons that induce different races to have varying levels of affection and disaffection for nominalism and realism
2420,by now it should be understood that the populations of ethnostates will differ in the way they face the mysteries of being
2421,the censor­ ship fear and fanaticism that historically have done so much to muzzle philosophers should disappear when it is agreed that philosophical schools have or should have separate homelands
2422,despite all the highminded talk philosophical disputes often have an undeniable racial tilt
2423,some ethnic groups have the ca­ pacity for abstract thought others want only the facts maam
2424,to stir these different groups in the same demo­ graphic pot might cause it to boil over as has happened fre­ quently in the past
2425,it is difficult to philosophize while im­ mersed in a caldron of violence
2426,all human societies are composed of skeptics and believers
2427,when orthodoxy smothers skepticism the social order hard­ ens
2428,when the reverse occurs we have ferment sometimes revolution
2429,when skepticism and faith are in equilibrium we are positioned for modulated change or harmonic evolution
2430,unmitigated skepticism denigrates or destroys most social values including some that are vital to civilization
2431,total sub­ mission to orthodoxy which tends to decelerate neurons may the ethnostate 159 put us in reverse
2432,we should nourish the work attitudes that have moved us upward and repudiate the critics and levelers
2433,who denigrate western industriousness
2434,we must come to recognize and un­ derstand our inherited capabilities so we can put them to ef­ fective use
2435,we cannot transform ourselves and still remain us but we can always improve reshape and hone our pol­ itical and cultural aptitudes
2436,superior talent bestowed by nature and perfected by nurture is not an assurance of genius but at the very least it should propel its fortunate possessors to the edge of this exalted category
2437,unfortunately man even the most gifted man will be compelled to operate within the hu­ man orbit until such time as positive evolution jumps him to a higher one
2438,in the meantime we should stretch our human limitations almost to the breaking point in preparation for a possible quantum leap into a new and more intelligent species
2439,revolutionaries and philosophers
2440,it is the habit of the pro­ fessional revolutionary and the professional criminal to jeop­ ardize every social order
2441,the former pretends to strive for societys good
2442,the latter having no valid excuse for his unlawful activity is less hypocritical
2443,committed to any violent means to achieve their ends both the revolutionary and the criminal have lost their footing on the evolutionary ladder and stepped down a few rungs as they pull everyone else down with them
2444,the professional revolutionaries must be persuaded to adopt enough of a skeptical philosophy to question only what is questionable and enough of an accommodating philosophy to accept only what is acceptable
2445,much depends on character
2446,so many of us too many of us have an itch for instant power and riches
2447,but how many deserve such rewards
2448,those who are deserving should be actively assisted
2449,those who are not should not be tantalized with high expectations
2450,today the ca­ reers of the more deserving are often sacrificed on the altar of affirmative action and minority agitprop
2451,the squeaking wheels that get the grease have become earsplitting
2452,nothing is more destructive to social equilibrium than the 160 the ethnostate widespread perception tha the undeserving are rewarded and the deserving penalized
2453,the undeserving must be made to understand that by never ceasing to bend the public ear with animadversions against racism they are revolutionaries in piccolo
2454,they manage to get away with this racial racketeer­ ing because in heterogeneous societies instead of being criti­ cized and denounced they are more likely to be praised
2455,an ethnostate can afford to keep orthodoxy and skepticism in better balance than can multiracial states which favor the skeptic at the expense of society as a whole
2456,the gravitational pull of homogeneity overcomes the negative forces of divisive­ ness and fragmentation that would otherwise have skeptics flying off in all directions
2457,what must the philosophy of the ethnostate be
2458,its direction and content should come out of a blend of experience and imagination a twin set of prerequisites that adds up to open and agile minds
2459,whatever line or lines of thought emerge they should not be allowed to coagulate into a constellation of hardened ideologies
2460,philosophy is the rough map of a territory made by a person who has never been there
2461,when the surveyor and his equip­ ment arrive on the scene no matter how brilliantly the philosopher has drawn upon his considerable powers of de­ duction and induction his map will not compare in accuracy to the one mapped by instruments
2462,but when a surveyor is not available or until he is available philosophy has a leading role to play in the upper reaches of human thought
2463,the wilder hypotheses of the early greek nature philoso­ phers crumbled before the power of rudimentary greek sci­ ence
2464,platos archetypes still exercise some influence though they have been expanded almost beyond recognition by carl jung
2465,as medical research plumbs deeper and deeper into the functioning of the brain the writings of plato and jung on the soul are becoming totally outmoded and relegated to the nebulous realm of childish guesswork
2466,our animal nature forces us to obey the laws of nature
2467,but part of our humanity derives from pretending we are not ani­ mals
2468,as long as our fertile and irrepressible imagination does the ethnostate 161 not lead us into psychological wildernesses that disturb or threaten our health and mental balance then more power to our power of thoughtand to us
2469,a frontburner mission of education in an ethnostate or any state is to teach students to recognize the dividing line between the real and the ideal while inspiring them to stake out large claims in both areas
2470,it is when we fail to recognize this bound­ ary or refuse to admit its existence that our minds begin to stumble
2471,to recapitulate the ethnostate should have no state philoso­ phy
2472,it should encourage the pursuit of philosophy so long as it is understood to be an exercise of the imagination not a rulebook of life
2473,no one knows the truth philosophers often least of all
2474,but there is little hann and occasionally great profit in the search
2475,although no philosopher has ever inhabited the kingdom of the wise his brushes with wisdom occasionally get him as far as the kingdoms gates
2476,some philosophers have developed the habit of putting themselves above science considering it infra dig
2477,the logical positivists now holding forth so stridently in academia conde­ scendingly bring up the subject of science as a prelude to denigrating it
2478,one of the most furious of this breed sir karl popper has even attempted to show that science at least in re­ spect to the various theories that underpin it is thoroughly unscientifi c although they may recognize human differences and a few like hegel have even considered some races to be subhuman philosophers ancient and modern have mainly addressed their lucubrations to the world at large not to a geographic or de­ mographic segment of it
2479,for a philosopher in the late 20th century to propound a system of thought based all or in part on race would be tantamount to academic suicide
2480,elitist philosophies may be propounded by such wizards of punditry 
2481,as nietzsche and santayana but without any serious effort to assign or confine their disciples to any anthropological cate­ gory
2482,to put it another way the west has reached a stage where philosophers are either not interested in developing philoso 162 the ethnostate phies specifically for westerners or dare not do so for fear of being branded nativists
2483,this fear is obviously impoverishing philosophical speculation
2484,the mind boggles at the wealth of ideas that might spring from philosophers exploring the liberating effects that ethnostates might have on the human condition
2485,contemporary philosophers avoid the differences and dwell on the similarities of homo sapiens
2486,this rigid conformity must bear some responsibility for the narrow range of modern philosophical studies
2487,despite the naysayers censors and mon­ itors who wish to keep philosophy in the deep freeze of liber­ alism and antiracism philosophical musings about genetics do not necessarily lead to holocausts
2488,on the contrary they ex­ pand the horizon of thought
2489,since philosophers are human like all humans they are the products of environmentally modulated genes
2490,different soils contain different nutrients which make possible the worlds profusion of flora
2491,the genetic differences of population groups which make possible the worlds profusion of the cat­ egory of fauna known as man combined with the variances in geography and culture provide the assorted intellectual nutri­ ents for the development of an exciting new field of study­ philosophical genetics
2492,chapter 10 on the evolutionary track natural selection
2493,evolution either moves forward or when the brakes are applied slips easily into reverse
2494,the watchword of every intelligent human being should be give evolution its head
2495,evolution is the kind of horse that runs longer and faster with a loose rein
2496,there is always danger in letting it go but there may be more danger in trying to stop it
2497,humanitarianism is perhaps the greatest drag on evolu­ tion because it defers to altruistic considerations that are not always in mans best interests
2498,more often than not humani­ tarianism does not advance man it seeks only to protect him
2499,if the rights of the group and the individual clash humani­ tarians commonly side with the latter
2500,since evolution is the work of races and species not individuals humanitarians look askance at it and will even go so far as to denounce darwin and uphold the discredited doctrine of lamarck who believed acquired characteristics could be inherited
2501,as raymond cattell has suggested man should not be en­ couraged to remain a single biological species
2502,when a genus is comprised of only one or two species it may be headed for extinction
2503,when it comes to extinction races decay somewhat like radioisotopes that is they never quite lose all their energy
2504,smaller and smaller traces of their genes will probably last as long as human life lasts
2505,the halflife of races never quite con­ verges to zero
2506,darwinism is actually five theories in one
2507,at a time when 163 164 the ethnostate partly due to a new outburst of wildeyed creationism and partly due to the sniping of marxist biologists thinking about evolution is growing fuzzier it might be wise to go back to the sourceto the grand evolutionist himself
2508,this is how darwin summarized darwinism 1 evolution all organic and inorganic matter is in a continuous differentially accelerated process of change
2509,2 common descent all organisms have emerged from a few simple organisms by the process of branching
2510,3 gradualness discontinuity or gaps in evolution are due to extinction of intermediate types and slow divergences that cannot be fully revealed by the meager historical record
2511,4 natural selection the adaptation of organisms to each other and to their environment by the proliferation of the bet­ ter adapted and the disappearance of the poorly adapted
2512,5 speciation the development of species by separation isolation and genetic drift
2513,natural selection and speciation items 4 and 5 are now working to mans disadvantage not to his advantage
2514,as al­ ways human beings are adapting as best they can but today in most countries the adaptation is retrogressive
2515,worldwide transportation and communications networks have made spe­ ciation which depends on separatism more difficult
2516,only the most remote parts of the globe and the most remote tribes still remain isolated
2517,a local idea can now be transformed into a global idea in a matter of days
2518,speciation is not furthered by ecumenical propaganda
2519,faustian impulses can be interpreted as a striving for varia­ tionin the sense of herbert spencers view of evolution as a march from the simple to the complex
2520,conceding that the more complex the organism the greater its need of energy it may be that highly sophisticated organisms will some day reach such a level of complexity that no amount of energy will suffice to make them viable
2521,is a cycle at work here a pulsa­ tion on the order of the big bang
2522,will some forms of life be­ come so intricate they will finally run out of evolutionary the ethnostate 165 steam since they will have to devote all their energy to main­ taining not increasing their complexity
2523,is it possible that at some point evolution will back up and move from the complex to the simple
2524,already there are signs that man is retreating to a lower energy level
2525,if this is not happening many of our leading politicians are acting as if they want it to happen
2526,supine behavior by the elite is evidence that evolutionary forces are at least being dampened
2527,if we are entering a phase of reverse evolution will it be shortlived
2528,it may be that we are being caught up in a ground swell which will sweep us back into a cold lifeless pre­ cambrian age
2529,without the evolutionary dynamica force so strong that it was able to create the organic out of the inor­ ganicspeciation may have to close up shop
2530,mother nature weeds out failed societies along with the elites responsible for the failure
2531,though it retards progress this winnowing process may be the best kind of survival insurance
2532,a breathing spell is well worth the loss of timean insignifi­ cant loss in view of the billions of years ·the earth is scheduled to endure
2533,if the wreckers were able to survive the society they wrecked if there was no time out for natural selection to replace the failures with succeeders human intelligence might nosedive
2534,who knows if the transition from ape to man could ever be repeated
2535,science and mathematics both in regard to their fonn per­ ception and use may differ from race to race see oswald spenglers decline of the west
2536,time and space do not mean the same things to everyone
2537,just as the two sexes have import­ ant differences in brain structure so do races
2538,differently structured brains cannot be expected to develop one allem­ bracing scientific worldview any more than different body structures can be expected to produce the same levels of physi­ cal perfonnance
2539,the racial differences revealed by iq and other tests should be taken seriously by laymen as well as by professionals
2540,these differences should be applauded instead of downgraded as current fashion dictates
2541,it is these differences not the simi 1arities which will inch man further up the evolutionary totem 166 the ethnostate pole
2542,speciation and isolation are the tried and proven ways to positive evolutionthe mechanism that got us here
2543,one of this studys most persistent themes is that widespread racial integration may prove to be an irreversible disaster
2544,man evolved precisely because of his variety and the speciation to which variety gave rise
2545,group differences not group simi­ larities have set the stage for the evolutionary dynamics that in a few billion years articulated protozoa into a newton
2546,if variety is the spice of life it is also the dynamic of life
2547,one vast agglomeration of men and women spread across the width and breadth of the globe all possessing closely related physical and mental traitsone large blob of humanity with everyone living looking and thinking alikewould tum the world into a giant equality sign that would signal the advent of reverse evolution
2548,onward and upward
2549,no matter what we call ourselves no matter how distant we feel we are removed from other pri­ mates we all possess or are possessed by certain primeval residues
2550,some of our behavior might shock our cavemen an­ cestors
2551,a very few of us act almost 100 human meaning that we manage to keep most of our animal nature under wraps
2552,this is all to the good because we cannot reasonably expect to reach a higher evolutionary plateau until we are able to put our mind in charge of our instincts
2553,nature sees to it that our bodies take care of themselves as long as we do not delib­ erately indulge in selfdestruction with drugs and other health­ threatening vices
2554,it is our minds that need all the tender care and attention we can afford to give them
2555,it has been fairly well established that the human brain has not increased in size since the time of cromagnon man
2556,like muscles brains thrive on exercise
2557,constant challenges keep the mind pumping
2558,if modem civilization in spite of the fre­ quent outbursts of barbarism makes life too easy and too se­ cure then the brain is bound to stagnate
2559,although the contemporary world of media banality the so­ called real world reminds us constantly of our lower na­ ture our nonsensual and nonsensate makeup calls upon us the ethnostate 167 to use our brain not for solving daytoday problems job worries family disputes sex matters but for striving to under­ stand the big problem for mulling over what the all is all about
2560,it is obvious that the state of mind that energizes deep thought is most easily attained when we are able to shrug off the real world
2561,nothing it must be said keeps the brain in better shape more on the qui vive than a long stint of re­ flection
2562,many religious denominations require retreats for their priests and ministers
2563,history is full of anecdotes about hermits and monks who retired to the wilderness to commune oneon­ one with their god or gods
2564,in their autobiographies or diaries famous statesmen have recorded how they wrestled laboriously with their conscience before they made the important decisions that shaped the destiny of their countries
2565,mystics have dis­ coursed long and seriously on the spiritual benefits obtained from trances
2566,all of the people involved as far as can be ascer­ tained were well aware that though their timeouts for soul­ searching interrupted their careers sometimes at great cost the ultimate gain outweighed the temporary loss
2567,darwin to the rescue
2568,natural selection works in tandem with environment
2569,in an immoral society those most fit for survival would be immoralists
2570,in a moral society moral indi­ viduals would have the best chance of passing on their genes
2571,if we wish to select for certain traits such as honesty and intel­ ligence then we must provide an environment that will allow people with such traits to survive and proliferate
2572,as the sci­ ence of genetics becomes more exact we ought to be able to breed character like any other trait
2573,the dour and industrious northern european the extroverted southern european the rhythmloving negro and the inscrutable chinese may be stereotypes but stereotypes had to start somewhere
2574,they may be advertised and promoted by bigoted minds but they were not invented by bigots
2575,the ethnostate should be spartan in its treatment of citizens in particular its young citizens always spurring them on never letting them rest forever testing their mettle by placing all sorts 168 the ethnostate of roadblocks in the paths of their careers
2576,family and state must cooperate even conspire to see to it that no citizen until he is well past middle age ever stops training for a life con­ stantly attuned to overcoming obstacles
2577,to keep evolution on track the ethnostate should present its citizens with challenges of the same intensity that faced early man
2578,a way has to be found to keep natural selection opera­ tional while removing its brutality
2579,the first step might be to drill into every man woman and child the kiplingesque and heideggerian proposition that life is serious so serious that the moment one hurdle in a persons education and career has been cleared he should be presented with another
2580,if this life­ long schedule of mental flexing is adopted by appreciable segments of mankind the challenges may exceed in number and direction if not in intensity those that in the distant past resulted in the explosion of brain size
2581,the large multiracial state is plainly not the place for this mindtoughening regimen
2582,the principal concern of such a state is to keep the peace to reduce the brawling of its motley
2583,population to a minimum and to divert its people with bread and circuses thereby making life easier not harder for all and sundry
2584,besides any program aimed at increasing the evolu­ tionary potential of the citizenry of a multiracial state would be denounced as elitist by professional equalitarians who would quickly discover or pretend to discover that one or another ethnic group was being disproportionately favored
2585,giant of a man
2586,darwin is a quasar in the firmament of hu­ man ingenuity
2587,in addition to his theory of evolution he ac­ knowledged what is currently unacknowledgeable except in whispers namely that there are racial differences in evolu­ tionary grade
2588,if he were alive today such ideas would have destroyed his professional credibility leaving his seminal theories to fall on deaf ears
2589,although darwins theories did more to destroy some of the most prevalent christian myths he led an exemplary christian life
2590,modest and unpretentious even when he knew he had all the voluminous data he needed he was still shy about pub the ethnostate 169 lication
2591,he was not the headlinehunting scientist of today who announces some sensational new theory or discovery in press releases but somehow never gets around to checking out his claims
2592,darwins method was in the best tradition of western science brilliant bouts of induction after decades of empirical diggingand then and only then publishing his findings the attacks by christian fundamentalists and latterday stalinists on darwin and the strictures placed by liberals on genetic research demonstrate once again an innate wide­ spread fear of science even in what is sometimes called the scientific age
2593,the empirically minded westerner looks askance at the so­ cial scientists who pay more attention to theory than experi­ ment and have an abhorrence of laboratories
2594,biological ex­ planations of behavior are developed and ready at hand to supplant the marxist and environmental theories which have dominated the social sciences for most of this century
2595,socio­ biology as its name implies accents the nature component of group behavior
2596,for daring to swim against the nurtur­ ist tide sociobiologist eo
2597,wilson was doused with water at a meeting of harvard radicals
2598,there is no reason why the sciences soft and hard social and physical could not prosper in an ethnostate
2599,the stum­ bling blocks which work to sciences detriment such as pol­ itically mandated limits on research and penalties for pub­ lishing sensitive racial data would be conspicuous by their absence
2600,scientists in all fields particularly in the biological sciences would be allowed to pursue their investigations no matter where they might lead no matter how controversial the results
2601,no other form of statecraft would give the search for truth such a green light
2602,chapter 11 futurology folk wandering
2603,america will never be resuscitated in the form it has known during most of its existence
2604,nonwhites to­ gether with legal and illegal immigrants most of whom are also nonwhite have moved into many of the nations largest metropolises where they are reproducing at a rate which has already colorized the inner cities
2605,the question arises how ef­ fectively are these minorities administering these megalo­ polises
2606,the answer law and order in americas largest mu­ nicipalities is breaking down to the point where economic and social chaos is propelling nonwhites into the white inner sub­ urbs which in tum is driving whites to flee to the outer suburbs and rural areas
2607,the picture is not a pretty one but it has some positive fea­ tures
2608,as whites become ever more besieged they are migrat­ ing in ever larger numbers to areas that could be the nuclei of white ethnostates
2609,this enforced togetherness is influencing them to develop a closer deeper and richer attachment to the culture that used to be theirs until large parts of it were sub­ merged in the flood of pluralism now engulfing the 50 states
2610,as far as millions of americans are concerned their country has already passed into alien hands
2611,all that is left to them is the remembrance of better times some history some fossilized institutions and some remnants of their genetic inheritance
2612,this is hardly enough to stand up to the crusading countercul­ ture of permissive liberalism a rabid prominority media and 170 the ethnostate 171 the institutionalized antiwhite racism known as affinnative ac­ tion
2613,the logistics of the population transfers previously alluded to may well be accelerated by historical surprises
2614,racial rioting on the grand scale would move huge blocs of people almost overnight
2615,massive economic dislocation and unem­ ployment in the industrial states would trigger a slow but steady exodus to greener pastures
2616,if more than 10 million gennans could be herded hundreds of miles westward in a few months as happened in 194546 in warravaged europe even greater numbers of people could be transported with even more speed with the help of more advanced fonns of mass transportation
2617,another world war ii migration was stalins enforced transfer of the volga gennans and other nationality groups to soviet asia after the gennan invasion of the u ssr
2618,in 1941 the flight of a million or more palestinians from what is now israel in 194748 was still another quickstep volkerwanderung
2619,the great northward trek of the boers in south africa in the last century also comes to mind
2620,regrouping and relocating 240 million americans into eth­ no states may seem to be in the realm of fantasy
2621,considering the huge population deplacements that have taken place else­ where in recent times demographic reshuffling on a similar scale is not altogether out of the range of possibility perpetual opposition
2622,jews who usually do well financially and politically when their host countries put the quietus on na­ tionalism have reservations about the ethnostate concept ex­ cept when it applies to israel
2623,at first glance the zionist state is the realization of ageold hopes and dreams of those jews longing to return to the homeland their ancestors left nearly two millennia ago
2624,but israel unlike certain european regions and provinces such as burgundy and flanders does not have a thousandyearold uninterrupted tradition of cultural auton­ omy and complete or partial independence a tradition that overshadows their history as appendages of france and belgium
2625,moreover the creation of burgundy and flanders did not require driving out and confiscating the property of a 172 the ethnostate million or more inhabitants
2626,israel was foisted on a land of nonjews by force of arms and money
2627,unless and until passions cool and palestinians and their arab and islamic supporters can be induced to ac­ cept a zionist political entity as a nextdoor neighbor israel will have to remain on a permanent war footing ready to fight at a moments notice for its existence
2628,this is not a safe and solid base on which to build an enduring social order of any kind let alone an ethnostate notwithstanding israe1s bulging stockpile of nuclear weapons and the allout support from americas two major political parties
2629,israel however is only part of a broader problem that faces world jewry
2630,the international dispersion of jews their pres­ ence in high places in so many countries runs counter to the ethnostate concept
2631,a political philosophy that emphasizes human differences does not sit well with a people long dedi­ cated to the promotion of internationalism
2632,ironically almost everything jews strenuously oppose in their host countriesracial
2633,or ethnic discrimination of any kind civil rights violations terrorism nationalism statesup­ ported religion majoritarian ruleflourish in israel
2634,there is little doubt that jews wherever they are found would be in the front line of the opposition to any serious eth­ nostate movement
2635,many influential negro leaders would likely join the jews believing but not admitting that blacks left to their own devices would be sorely pressed to establish a successful ethnostate or any state on the western model at this point in time
2636,as proved by the dismal history of their african habitats blacks have much to learn in the art of statecraft
2637,searching for ways to overcome the combined jewish and black opposition ethnostatists would probably debate the mer­ its and demerits of a onefront or twofront strategy
2638,some would advocate engaging the negroes first and bypassing jews on the basis that it is wiser to defeat the weaker enemy before going after the stronger
2639,ethnostate advocates would argue that jews and negroes would not be taken in by this divide et im­ pera strategy so both should be confronted simultaneously but criticizing jews and negroes is not a healthy activity in the ethnostate 173 the presentday western world
2640,the socalled impact media can easily ruin the reputation of anyone from a president on down who adopts a negative attitude to these two powerful mi­ norities
2641,western politicians have learned to their sorrow that a disparaging headline that even hints of antisemitic and anti­ black sentiments can be more dangerous to their career than a muggers knife
2642,despite some occasional antisemitic outbursts by black radicals jews and negroes are either willing or unwilling allies
2643,jews it will be recalled played a leading role in financing and directing the civil rights crusade that lifted american negroes out of political obscurity and transformed them into a power­ ful minority
2644,jews were in the forefront of the campaign to lift longestablished immigration quotas to open the gates that filled american cities with fellow jews southern europeans hispanics and asians that filled british cities with west indians asian indians and pakistanis german cities with turks and french cities with algerians and black africans
2645,an ethnostate has room for only one race
2646,although the re­ location of 30 million american negroes in the united states and millions of blacks and other minorities in europe would present massive logistical problems the relocating of jews would not
2647,the state of israel is waiting for them with open arms
2648,those jews who dont want to go therethe majority of jewscould be given enclaves in any number of the new world and old world countries in which they are now congre­ gated
2649,long island just across the east river from manhattan the center of the diasporas financial power would make an ideal jewish ethnostate
2650,white knight
2651,recent events in what was once the soviet union have given a tremendous boost to the ethnostate idea
2652,if the rest of the white world sinks into barbarism or dies out by massive miscegenation and genocidally low reproductive rates russia and other slavic spinoffsukraine belarus with per­ haps a few more in the offingare well positioned to produce a healthy population of whites quite capable of safeguarding the slavs modified form of western civilization
2653,so even if 174 the ethnostate worse comes to worst all may not be lost
2654,eastern european ethnostates arising from the ashes of a collapsed marxist em­ pire may be ready willing and able to take up the cause of western civilization so pitifully abandoned by its founders
2655,the one complicating factor in the ethnic regrouping is the scattering of russians throughout the nonrussian parts of the defunct communist imperium
2656,greatly reduced in size and population two russian ethno­ states one in europe another in siberia either separately or together could emerge as a stronger power than their prede­ cessor the stagnant overcentralized soviet union of unblessed memory
2657,a homogeneous state relieved of the burden of lord­ ing it over a multiplicity of vassal republics is a healthier stronger and more enduring political entity than a sprawling disjointed empire held together by brute force
2658,the breakup of the soviet union could be a powerful model for other population groups who wish to strike out on their own
2659,if the devolution of the baltic states of moldavia georgia annenia azerbaijan and the moslem states in asia takes place without too much violence and mayhem if the soviet spinoffs manage to make a go of their newly acquired independence the citizens of britain france gennany spain canada the united states and other western countries might come to see the many advantages inherent in devolution
2660,self­ detennination has always been the most sensible and intelligent axiom of politics
2661,how many foreign and civil wars would not have been fought how many revolutions would have been avoided how many millions of human lives saved if this basic principle of statecraft had been observed from the day a cou­ ple of paleolithic families first got together and worked out the glimmerings of tribal government
2662,in constant touch
2663,history makes it very plain that when cities get too big urban populations look to the countryside for talent
2664,urbanization appears to have a deadening effect on the offspring of bornandbred city folk
2665,the urban imbalance is more serious in some small countries where the ratio of the urban population to suburbanites and ruralists is even more the ethnostate 175 pronounced than in large states
2666,when small nations succumb to urban sprawl there is hardly any countryside left from which to draw new blood or more gray matter
2667,ethnostates would be dedicated to keeping the cityside­ countryside proportion in reasonable balance
2668,now that high­ tech communications enable remote rural communities to be in instant touch with the world at large one of the most impor­ tant functions of the city is disappearing
2669,today nearly every­ one in the developed countries is or can be in a worldwide communications network of one form or another
2670,the 24 hour electronic outpouring of gigabyte data bases that can be picked up by anyone with a phone line modem and computer has all but ended the isolation that was such a handicap to people in remote areas
2671,not so long ago it was necessary for a nations elite to reside in the political and financial center of the country to get any­ thing done
2672,business had to be conducted in large cities be­ cause only there could entrepreneurs get financing for their companies and find the experienced personnel to run them
2673,today the headquarters of a corporation can function almost as well in a remote mountain hamlet as in a municipal sky­ scraper
2674,only heavy industry with its need for a huge work­ force must still be located near transportation networks and population centers though it is quite possible that robots will put an end to this outmoded concentration of labor pools
2675,an ethnostate might well be the first cityless state
2676,like most businesses government can now be run just as efficiently­ perhaps more efficientlyfrom suburban office complexes as from large unwieldy agglomerates of bureaucrats herded to­ gether in massive neogreek bureaucratic hives in some vast megalopolis
2677,tomorrows europe
2678,european unity is an old dream that a few dreamers and schemers have triedand failedto make come true
2679,there have been some serious and halfserious at­ tempts in the pastcharlemagne one or two holy roman emperors napoleon and atter1y hitler
2680,but for most of his­ tory the inhabitants of the peninsular continent have preferred 176 the ethnostate to snipe scrap and war with each other rather than unite
2681,at the moment the greatest incentive for pulling together is the growing desire of europeans to escape the orbit of the one remaining superpower
2682,as long as russia the principal heir of the soviet union controls some 13000 nuclear warheads it must be accorded quasisuperpower status
2683,now that the soviet union has collapsed and in the process has shed its eastern european satellites many europeans be­ lieving the cold war to be over would like to say goodbye to the american armed forces once all russian troops are out of poland czechoslovakia and what for more than four decades was called east germany
2684,more pragmatic europeans believe that as long as russia has a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons and is in a period of dangerous instability it would be wiser for american troops to remain in place
2685,russian leaders would be very pleased with a neutralized europe sans the us military presence
2686,but should russia be­ come stridently nationalist fascist or get caught up in pan­ slavism always possibilities in that neurotic land mass this might expose nonrussian europe to a military attack from the east that western and central european powers could not successfully resist by themselves and might not attempt to re­ sist
2687,if properly armed however a federation of european eth­ nostates with something more to defend than a collection of oldline decadent ochlocracies ought to be able to withstand or scare off any russian or slavic assault with or without the assistance of the united states nationalism has long been a source of festering disputes and wars that have practically decimated the european population
2688,in prenationalist times europe was a mosaic of provinces all with distinct characteristics
2689,it is in these provinces that the real strength and vitality of europe have always rested
2690,it is in these provinces resuscitated and reorganized as ethnostates that eu­ ropean culture may once again break sensational new ground in art music literature philosophy and science
2691,beyond tomorrow
2692,how many nonwhite countries have given equal rights to whites and if so for how long
2693,past and the ethnostate 177 current history produces few examples
2694,when it comes down to it whites do rather poorly in nonwhite states now that the age of colonization is history
2695,governments of nonwhite countries are seldom tolerant and hardly ever democratic
2696,in the us where whites are still supposed to be in the drivers seat nonwhites with the assistance of white liberals and some white minorities have managed to enact laws that actually dis­ criminate against whites in jobs education and public housing
2697,if this can occur when nonwhites are still in the minority what will america be like when they outnumber whites
2698,gloomy forebodings of what whites in western countries with huge black populations may face can be limned in joseph conrads heart of darkness
2699,one way to safeguard the rights and physical wellbeing of outnumbered whites in a mixed­ race or nonwhite nation would be to resort to the intermittent latin american practice of securing white survival by white or mostly white military juntas or dictatorships
2700,although those who have not been to cuba in recent decades may disbelieve it fidel castros absolutist regime at least in the top echelons is considerably whiter than the white houseapproved batista government that el maximum lider overthrew
2701,any sensible discussion of the future of the bleak as well as the rosy alternatives must include what effect our increasing knowledge of the inner and outer world the genome and deep space may have on the human psyche
2702,is it possible that a surfeit of knowledge lowers morale and the will to live
2703,when the immediate problems of politics eco­ nomics and technology are cleared up when we seem to be on the way to solving the more intricate riddles of life and death the world may be revealed as more of an enemy than a friend
2704,despite the scaremongers who receive big helpings of mon­ ey and reams of publicity for prophesying the imminent end of the world it is doubtful that a fullscale nuclear war at least in this stage of fusion and fission weapons would put an end to civilization and as some eschatologists like to say all life on earth
2705,consider new zealand iceland even argentinaany of these countries is capable of carrying on the basic core of western civilization and culture
2706,178 the ethnostate according to some futurologists the end times for the united states and perhaps for other western countries will follow one of these scenarios a as soon as noflwhites outnumber whites in previously white countries the prevailing form of government as history so eloquently testifies will switch from representative govern­ ment to a military or tribal dictatorship which will lead the west back to a new dark age
2707,b radical marxist regimes will terrorize restless hetero­ geneous masses to substitute class hatred for their racial hos­ tilities thereby making it possible to install a dictatorship of the proletariat which will hold on to its power and privileges by handing over ever greater sums of the countrys diminish­ ing wealth to nonwhites
2708,c a breakup of the west along racial lines accompanied by a largescale relocation of populations will confine euro­ peans and their descendants overseas to a much smaller living space
2709,this is the only course of events which could eventually lead to a world or continent of white and nonwhite ethno­ states thereby allowing western civilization to survive in mi­ crocosm if not in macrocosm
2710,westerners in the us and elsewhere can really never be confident of carrying on the great adventure into ethno­ statism until their present psychological makeup is radically altered
2711,it is not that they are too much at the mercy of their instincts
2712,it is that their instincts are unbalanced
2713,they seem to revel in what they considerwronglyto be their best instinct their overabundance of altruism which is exactly what has been prodding them along the road to selfdestruction
2714,let us not deceive ourselves that because most of us are not hungry when we go to bed that because our homes stay snug and dry when storms and cold fronts move in that because most of us somehow hang onto our jobs all is well
2715,some of the healthiestlooking individuals we pass in the street have cancers real or psychological rotting away their bodies or minds
2716,history teaches us that appearances can be quite de the ethnostate 179 ceptive that political economic and social collapse can strike as unexpectedly and as destructively as lightning
2717,if we pre­ pare now for the inevitable if we can piece together a coherent plan for future action we will have a leg up on chaos when comes the crunch
2718,of genes and things
2719,it is customary when talking or writ­ ing about future organizations of society to come out with strident detailed menus of what should or should not be done
2720,much of this is a waste of time since the future seldom fits sce­ narios dreamed up by writers living in the present
2721,all futurol­ ogists however should have the key obligation of proposing ways to protect the gene pools of their respective races and population groups
2722,no people should let its unique biological treasure be lost or diluted to where it can never be recovered
2723,whatever prevents this from happening is right whatever lets it happen is wrong
2724,such are the bare bones of an ethnostate manifesto
2725,to reach the point where we put the ethnostate above all other forms of statehood ancient and modem will take some doing
2726,win or lose it will be a productive and enlightening fight
2727,it qualifies as a fight for freedom because the greatest and most important freedom is the freedom to survive
2728,the planet earth is fast becoming an overcrowded hothouse in which a chaotic multitude of flowers instead of blossoming are literally killing each other off
2729,whole forests are disap­ pearing along with thousands of plant species as civilization rumbles on with its bulldozers graders cement mixers and caravans of asphalt trucks
2730,the most attractive gardens are those alive with different colors
2731,flowers look their best in separate clumps so their unique traits are multiplied and magnified for the greater plea­ sure of gardeners
2732,when many varieties of flowers are scattered haphazardly there is a mass of color but no formno oppor­ tunity to enjoy the different varieties separately as the traveler enjoys the different cultures that unfold when he passes from one country to another
2733,chairman mao tsetung said in a rare oracular moment 180 the ethnostate let a thousand flowers blossom
2734,later he proceeded to cut down not only the flowers but the gardeners as well
2735,if he had let his gardens flourish and grow he might be remembered as a pioneering ethnostatist instead of just another antiwhite marxist autocrat
2736,genetic forecasting
2737,genes must have some direct links to the state of mind that steers culture in certain directions
2738,otherwise after some 60 years of concentrated indoctrination all westerners would now be liberals
2739,how can it be that so many of us still put more trust in our feelings than in what the educational system the government and the media tell us
2740,if environment is the overwhelming determinant of behavior and thought as so many modem schools of sociology and psy­ chology allege every vestige of antiliberalism would have long since been expunged from the western mind
2741,man has always been a partner of nature in directing human evolution
2742,now he is becoming the senior partner
2743,despite the sermon on the mount aggression when properly controlled is a beneficial trait
2744,but it must be transformed into aggression for man instead of aggression against man
2745,we must be pro­ grammed to war against ignorance not against other countries to assault the farthest comers of space not an old lady on her way to buy groceries
2746,what is the harm of a genetic report card that lists the in­ born and inherited qualities and capabilities of every infant
2747,where is the harm in providing the infants parents and even the child at the appropriate time with a data sheet that pre­ dicts with some accuracy what courses he would do best in and what kind of career would be most suitable to his talents
2748,self­ knowledge an awareness of ones own strengths and weak­ nesses both mental and physical is a powerful weapon in the battle of life
2749,such knowledge cannot come too early for a growing child who needs to know where to apply his talents to the best effect
2750,what better way to shorten the tremendous amount of time so many young people waste before they find the right job
2751,it may soon be possible to provide a fairly accurate physical the ethnostate 181 and mental profile of human beings even while theyre in the fetal stage
2752,what is delaying the wide use of this important breakthrough is the opposition of those who refuse to accept that much of what every person accomplishes in life is deter­ mined at the first moment of conception
2753,just as the knowl­ edge of a persons genetic makeup can be applied to directing him where he can make the most of his capabilities so can the recognition of different matrices of genes of various popula­ tion groups sub races and races be useful in determining the form of politics and the type of economy appropriate for par­ ticular ethnostates
2754,people are different individually and in the mass
2755,the col­ lective differences would be accentuated not covered up in ethnostates and put to work for the benefit of all concerned­ in contrast to the multiracialists attempts to play down the in­ nate mental differences of groups and play up the superficial similarities
2756,go to the gene
2757,training nutrition and other environmental factors beyond the control of nature all have a profound effect on animal and human strength
2758,but if the basic bone structure and musculature are not there the most strenuous conditioning and exercise will not do the necessary work
2759,if the task is seemingly undoable if all else fails go to the genea rule already honored by horticulturalists and cattle breeders but still anathema to most educators and politicians
2760,those who stand so firmly and fanatically on the nurture side of the naturenurture controversy have a great advantage
2761,they are able to propound endlessly that what is deterministic is immoral
2762,it is a powerful argument in a country and in an era bemused by morality
2763,but the point is there is morality if not more morality on the side of the naturists
2764,is it not more moral to know ones capabilities and limitations than to be ignorant of them
2765,what is more immoral than to encourage a person to perform a task beyond his capability
2766,a sprinter ordered to run the 100 meter dash in 11 seconds when his best time has never been less than 13 seconds would end up in a madhouse if after 182 the ethnostate failing again and again he was still ordered to keep trying
2767,think of the plight of the sprinter
2768,then think of the nurtur­ ists who are forever pitting sharp minds against dull minds in the belief that given the same environment everyone has equal learning capabilities
2769,ponder the immorality of implanting roseate hopes of success in business or the professions into highschool seniors who cannot pass a simple math test
2770,fanatic nurturists believing intelligence is learned not inher­ ited keep preaching they want a world in which everyone is equally intelligent
2771,they forget to mention that there is only one very impractical way to achieve this pieinthesky objec­ tivea threestep method that they would reject in horror 1 remove enough brain cells from the gifted so they will sink to the average intellectual level of the masses 2 implant these same cells in the brains of morons to bring their iqs up to 100 3 inaugurate a longterm childbearing program in which intelligent spouses are encouraged to mate with unintel­ ligent spouses until the intelligence curve of the population flattens
2772,there is a fourth way which though it cannot do anything about equalizing people and races physically or mentally at least will alleviate some of the unhappiness and frustration caused by individual and racial inequality
2773,that is the way of separatism which confines competition to members of the same race thus eliminating the friction caused in multiracial states by inherited group differences
2774,violence is immoral
2775,envy is immoral
2776,murder mayhem pogroms and massacres are immoral
2777,nuclear chemical and biological warfare is totally immoral
2778,the next time a nurturist accuses a naturist of immorality because the latter believes in­ telligence is genetically determined the naturist should turn the argument around and tick off the immoral consequences of foisting nurturism not only on people but on their institu­ tions as well
2779,ask a nurturist to explain why genetic engin­ eering is bad but social engineering is good
2780,after much hemming and hawing he may finally blurt out if you are right then truth is immoral
2781,at that moment the argument ends
2782,what the nurturist is attacking are not ideas but the faus the ethnostate 183 tian element in western man
2783,almost as bad as war as a winnower of the best specimens of all races is wanderlust which puts the bravest most energetic human beings in direct contact with indigenous peoples a sit­ uation that almost guarantees miscegenation and all the
2784,prob­ lems that derive therefrom
2785,what saved the british colonies in north america from the political and economic chaos that be­ devils latin america was that the british and most other white immigrants who settled in what is now canada and the united states brought their wives and children along or married peo­ ple of their own race after their arrival
2786,the mediterranean peoples who came to latin america consisted largely of single men soldiers gold seekers adventurers who expended their libido on native women
2787,once the earth had been thoroughly canvassed and mapped it was inevitable that a race infected with wanderlust would di­ rect its energies to the exploration of space
2788,out there the pos­ sibility of racemixing is almost nil there being no one in the solar system to mate with
2789,perhaps in the milky way but how could potential parents ever find each other
2790,shifting the wanderlust of western man to space exploration will also tend to diminish his earthbound transgressions
2791,war has become a very serious business what with nucleartipped missiles ready for buttonpushers in a growing number of countries
2792,homicide until recently thought of as the most egregious of crimes has now been upstaged by genocide a word unknown until 1944 since the ethnostate is by definition monoracial any fullscale attack by a foreign state on an ethnostate can be interpreted as something on the order of genocide
2793,no nation not even the most militaristic wants to be accused of genocide
2794,consequently even the most imperialistic generals dictators and presidents would have to think twice before unleashing their armed forces against a peaceful ethnostate
2795,chapter 12 unguessing history it is difficult to get a grasp on history without some under­ standing of the genetic and cultural parameters of the civili­ zation or people under study
2796,the classification and identifi­ cation of genetic influences on collective human behavior up to now sadly and often forcibly neglected should be at the core of future historical studies if such studies are to emerge from the tendentious level and guesswork to which they have been confined iri modem times
2797,as taboos change the intensity or laxity of their observance varies over the years and centuries
2798,the particular talents of great men flourish at their full capacity where the free exercise of these talents is tolerated and often encouraged
2799,conversely some important mental leaps and breakthroughs have been made in intolerant and straitlaced societies where repression and frustration have actually stimulated enterprising minds to defy the deadweight of authority
2800,who would dare say what plato might have thought or writ­ ten had he been born in 17thcentury boston
2801,or in chairman maos china
2802,what would michelangelo have done if he had been born in ancient israel where graven images were prohib­ ited
2803,every artist must operate within windows of opportunity some of which are wide open some only slightly
2804,just as flow­ ers and vegetables are dependent on the soil and climate where they are planted humans must depend on their manmade en­ vironment for intellectual sustenance an environment ulti 184 the ethnostate 185 mately detennined by a mix of geography and genes with less and less emphasis on the fonner as man learns to pay more attention to the latter
2805,contemporary theories of history have become so tainted with equalitarianism and environmentalism that openminded research into the causes and origins of civilization has been partially suspended
2806,what modem historians most of whom hardly deserve the title even as a courtesy are mainly con­ cerned about is the justification and proof of their pet theories
2807,they jump at some particular event or series of events to demonstrate that marx freud or marcuse were right hardly giving a passing thought to the biological sources of history
2808,even toynbee and spengler the two most important 20th­ century historians are more content to schematize the ups and downs of cultures and civilizations than to focus on the genetic factors without which there would be no history at all  not for the first time history has reached the point where a clever historian can manipulate it to prove almost anything
2809,the rule appears to be that those who wish to take charge of a state must first take charge of its history
2810,instead of learning about the past we are fed historicism a mischievous mishmash of unfounded theory irresponsible flights of fancy and addic­ tive reductionism as our professors sordidly angle for aca­ demic honors and rewards
2811,how complex how argumentative how hyperarticulated can a field of learning get before it sinks out of sight in a quagmire of incredulity and ridicule
2812,historians must acknowledge that environment has preceded man is always with him and will of course outlast him
2813,after the environment comes man himself who makes an artificial environment which modifies and often conflicts with what nature has wrought
2814,imagine a pendulum not the ordinary type that swings back and forth in a vertical plane but a foucault pendulum that circles around a fixed point
2815,in our naturenurture model the fixed point moves and the pendulum follows
2816,the movement is not meant to show progression or retrogression in any his­ torical sense
2817,no value judgments please
2818,the metaphor is in­ tended to illustrate the movement of historic cycles which is 186 the ethnostate more than mere chronology and the repetition of events
2819,the fact is events never repeat
2820,they only give the illusion of repetition
2821,what our metaphoric pendulum attempts to demon­ strate is that history has its cycles but never the same cycles
2822,in saying this we are contradicting some famous sages of history who tell us we must learn from recurring patterns
2823,the point is we should not be interested in patterns or theories of history
2824,we should be interested in history
2825,the triune modelnatural environment man artificial environmentis not quite as simple as its circular form ap­ pears
2826,the earth has a range of environments which work on man in different ways and to which he responds in different ways
2827,since there are different kinds of men there will be dif­ ferent responses to the same environment
2828,a certain set of circumstances influences or forces a certain group of men to act or live in a certain way
2829,these same cir­ cumstances might induce a different group of men to act or react in a sharply different manner
2830,just as individuals differ widely in disposition and temperament so do groups
2831,group behavior is strongly influenced by leaders of the groups by those whose temperament and predispositions instincts are magnifications of the average temperament and predisposi­ tions of the group at large
2832,a time factor must also be considered
2833,a young race or a new race that emerges on the world scene will behave act and react differently than an old race one that has been around for millennia and whose behavior and attitudes have been frozen by habit or softened and diluted by easy living sexual permis­ siveness cynicism and general decadence
2834,such factors will change the character of groups as much as they change the character of individuals
2835,environment created man whose instincts and intelligence drove him to modify it to the point where mlch of it is now the work of man
2836,accordingly historical progress should be explained as the modification of the environment by human means
2837,this is the same as saying that people who for good or evil dont affect the environment dont make history
2838,to have a serious go at history we should study the environment at any the ethnostate 187 particular time and place after first learning as much as we can about the genetic constitution of the people who have both in­ fluenced and been influenced by the environment
2839,once on top of this information we have a recipe for solid historical studyone that needs no recourse to any such vague the­ oretical constructs as dialectical materialism challenge and re­ sponse or eternal return
2840,these omissions will help not hinder us if we wish to unearth the past as it really was
2841,in mentioning the traveling foucault pendulum nothing was said about what makes it travel
2842,it travels because of the human adaptations that are constantly changing the environment
2843,call it historys primum mobile
2844,here again it is appropriate to point out that change does not always mean progress
2845,it can mean the opposite
2846,we can only come to a fixed conclusion about what happened history when we study the inner actions of man the manmade environment and the natural environ­ ment on a casebycase basis
2847,only by a thorough knowledge of its parts can we obtain an accurate picture of the historical whole
2848,induction has lifted some imaginative people to high levels of problem solving
2849,history however is a case where induction should be given short shrift
2850,putting aside all theorizing we should collect facts as lovingly and carefully as the oldtime prospectors in california sifted through streambeds for gold
2851,only then will historians strike it rich and their favorite disci­ pline become if not a science then a discipline with a scientific footing
2852,in reflecting on history it should be kept in mind that we are likely to become lost in a labyrinth of error and confusion if we lend too much credence to what is cavalierly called the historical evidence most of which is often pure surmise
2853,we have only to note the falsifications of the contemporary media to realize how little of what we read see or hear about daily events has any relation to the truth
2854,if newsmen cant get the facts straight about what happened yesterday before their very eyes how can we believe what historians write about events that occurred a thousand years or more before they were born
2855,we can still see the acropolis but we cant see socrates
2856,more 188 the ethnostate importantly we cant ask him if the contradictory things plato and xenophon wrote about him were even an approximation of the truth
2857,we can probably come as close to the historical truth by extrapolating from our own experiences as we can by leafing through ponderous tomes by dead historians or digest­ ing tendentious theses by those who are still alive and still busy promoting some discredited ideology
2858,oswald spengler the doomandgloom historian was partly right
2859,cultures and civilizations are organic and pass through cycles of birth growth maturity and death
2860,but the german philosopher of history neglected to add perhaps so as not to put his scholarly respectability at risk that races are even more organic than cultures and civilizations
2861,more than any other factor their appearance and disappearance their efflorescence and decay are the real stuff of history
2862,spengler linked various stages of culture and civilization with the seasons
2863,his organic timetables should but unfortu­ nately did not stimulate research into the racial components of his cultures
2864,broadening spenglers cycles into racial cycles would deepen the study of the past and help remove a great deal of the guesswork responsible for the promulgation of so many wildand in the case of marxismviolenceprovoking and envyridden theories of history
2865,nations life only part of the human story hopefully an ever diminishing part
2866,from nations arise the multiracial enormities known as empires which after alternating periods of affluence and poverty after stunning military victories and disastrous de­ feats exhaust the energies of the original culture bearers who then revert to the barbarous condition from which they origi­ nally emerged
2867,in modified spenglerian terms a race is the springtime a nation is the summer an empire is the autumn and the return to barbarism is the winter
2868,first on the scene is a hunting band then a tribe then the beginnings of a homoge­ neous state or nation
2869,prosperous and successful homogeneous nations inevitably attract immigrants of other races which pro­ ceed to make the population heterogeneous
2870,in the process the stage is set for a polyglot empire which holds together only as long as the military or ruling party is strong enough to control the ethnostate 189 internal ethnic hostilities and powerful enough to ward off foreign enemies
2871,one of the implicit goals of the ethnostate is precisely to stop this spenglerian cycle dead in its tracks to let it go no further than its springtime
2872,huge unwieldy heteroge­ neous nations and empires cannot emerge from small homo­ geneous states if the first duty of the state is to prohibit the genetic dilution of its population
2873,summer cannot follow spring and winter autumn if there are no seasons
2874,spengler may have discovered some order in history but there is no reason to buy the deterministic and pessimistic line that history must repeatand repeatand re­ peat
2875,in point of fact the autumn of a culture usually starts to set in shortly after the end of its springtime
2876,despite the so­ called power and glory of the british empire england was never so great as when shespeares dazzling pen was active and newton was mathematizing gravity
2877,america a super­ power for most of the late 20th century was never so great as when the founding fathers were turning political science into high art
2878,races taking root in the seedbeds of their particular envi­ ronments create the cultures which evolve into what we call civilizations
2879,when races expire their cultural creations founder
2880,a state may survive its creators but only in a per­ verted and distorted form
2881,races set the time and spatial boundaries of cultures
2882,the rise and fall of a race can encom­ pass the birth and death of several cultures created by that race in different environments and in different eras
2883,whereas a tribal community the embryo of a state might have a life span of only a few hundred yearsthe state itself although undergoing radical transformations in government and territory may endure for ten or more centuries
2884,races live much longer
2885,the nordic alpine and mediterranean subraces are still extant and have been since recorded history
2886,the same may be said about the negroid and mongoloid races
2887,but where are the cromagnons
2888,when the racial memory is lost the race as a dynamic historical force is also lost
2889,if a state perishes the damage is not necessarily irreparable
2890,the founding race may still be around still fertile enough to 190 the ethnostate engender other states and other cultures and civilizations
2891,states and cultures that emerge from the genetic substrate of the same race even though far removed in time and space are apt to have many common characteristics
2892,history defined
2893,a countrys greatness does not depend on the wars it has won the wealth it has produced or the territory it has grabbed
2894,a countrys greatness is determined by the genius of its people and by applying that genius to unique achievements in the arts sciences and government
2895,history is not the biography of nations as some prefer to define it
2896,to say that the united states was born in 1776 went through internal convulsions in the civil war became the leading world power for most of the 20th century and then entered a precipitous decline is to calendar a few salient facts and dates but tells next to nothing about the composition of its people their habits and their attitudes
2897,the united states unlike most large nations underwent a series of significant racial alterations in the last two centuries
2898,what started out as a constellation of overwhelmingly british colonies was modified in the mid19th century by irish and germans then heavily infiltrated by eastern europeans and jews at the tum of the century and by hispanics and east asians after 1965 historians may still use the united states as a verbal shortcut but the united states of the late 18th cen­ tury bears very little demographic resemblance to the united states of today
2899,to understand what has happened to america or to any other state over any period of time it is first necessary to take note of its people
2900,the history of the us is first a history of the british founders second a history of the population mix that turned the british racial core into a minority
2901,a state that was composed of one people cannot remain the same when several other peoples are added to the demographic pot
2902,history gets confused when populations get confused
2903,as long as one people keeps its identity and remains the dominant majority or dominant population group of a state it is possible to write a meaningful history of the state
2904,that is why history the ethnostate 191 will be more truthful and reliable in a world of ethnostates where authentic histories can be written about authentic peo­ ples
2905,it is relatively easy to write the history of a single people it is almost impossible to write the histories of several peoples and combine them into one historic whole
2906,the history of an ethnostate will be the history of one peo­ ple in one chronological and one geographical frame
2907,histo­ ries of multiracial states and empires are necessarily scattershot because historians must deal with a kaleidoscope of geograph­ ical environmental and demographic data
2908,consider the form of government known as democracy
2909,how and why did it only arise in states scattered thousands of miles apart and separated by thousands of years
2910,what if any is the unifying factor
2911,it was that the citizens of athens had roughly the same genetic components as the icelanders the writers of the magna carta and the signers of the declaration of independence
2912,how similar are the ideas the artistic drives and the political motivations of these different peoples
2913,on the other hand what could be more dissimilar than their chronol­ ogy and their environmental challenges
2914,yet of all the worlds peoples they were the first to make selfgovernment a corner­ stone of politics
2915,young states have but one history
2916,as states age and indulge in pluralism they accumulate several histories the separate his­ tories of the several population groups
2917,over time the chances are that one or more of these groups will become envious of the ruling majority or core group and attempt to oust it from power either by violence or indirectly by maintaining a much higher birthrate
2918,it then becomes customary for historians to trace the development of the states institutions without taking too much notice of the people who developed the institutions
2919,eventually each population groups separate history becomes a tool for boosting group selfesteem and a weapon for lower­ ing the selfesteem of rival groups
2920,sooner or later history is reduced to a rhetorical accommodation to ethnicity
2921,to obtain a better understanding of history eo
2922,wilson the father of sociobiology proposed a new discipline deep his­ tory which would trace mans development from the first 192 the ethnostate appearance of homo sapiens
2923,this kind of history would in­ clude clues about the origin of races and subraces which in turn would indicate how the people who formed hunting bands tribes and later nations were themselves formed
2924,the western historical establishment wary of any theory of history that touches on biology tends to look with special dis­ favor upon any manifestation of ethnicity on the part of ma­ jorities
2925,minorities are forgiven and often encouraged to be as raceminded as they wish while majority ethnocentrism is condemned out of hand
2926,hitlers germany served as a major justification for this allpervasive hostility towards white race consciousness
2927,the theme when hammered home by white liberal historians often seems to come close to a majority death wish
2928,polyethnicity as expressed by william h mcneill the wide­ ly acclaimed professor of history at the university of chicago has become the latest mania of the historical establishment
2929,although the implanting of several different races and sub­ races within the boundaries of one country is admittedly destabilizing and a prime cause of internal strife the homo­ geneous alternative is considered even worse
2930,to support this latter thesis mcneill and his school downsize the high cultural peaks reached in homogeneous states assum­ ing that even in their greatest days the population was riddled with minoritiesslaves imported laborers and tillers of the soil merchants missionaries preaching exotic religions for­ eign intellectuals aliens of every hue and colorwithout whose assistance the state would have stagnated
2931,this school of history even goes so far as to assert that the tensions provoked by the presence of heterogeneous racial groups actually help to raise the level of artistic output
2932,by and large the history of the west has consisted of the history of white majorities
2933,only in this century have white and later nonwhite minorities assumed a measure of power in western countries
2934,in the united states minority political and economic clout has reached the stage where more and more history is becoming minority history and is being taught as such in leading american universities
2935,the ethnostate 193 a major aid to the understanding of the history of hetero­ geneous states is parasitology a relatively new science that should be studied carefully by all historians
2936,animal para­ sitology is already an established scientific discipline complete with texts and courses in medical colleges
2937,what is lacking so farand perhaps for understandable reasonsis the study known as human parasitology
2938,at the human level parasitology is not simply men and women living off other men and women in the usual parasitic model
2939,beyond feeding off human bodies it includes feeding off human minds a form of parasitism which for lack of a better word might be called psychovorism
2940,as minds grow softer in decadent timesand these are very decadent times­ they become less resistant to psychovores
2941,chapter 13 less law more justice the laws of ethnostates should be attuned to the physical and mental traits of its inhabitants
2942,whether written or unwrit­ ten the constitution should be organic meaning that it should have the authority to preserve the status quo while inspiriting adventurous minds to go beyond it
2943,genes sow the seeds of law which loop back to shape the culture
2944,the point to stress in any discussion of law is that there can be no human rights without ethnic rights
2945,the most equitable and enforceable statutes are those written not in law books but in the heart and mind
2946,the most inequitable and the most un­ enforceable laws are those enacted by pandering politicians and interpreted by politically appointed judges
2947,compare the publics respect for statutory law to its respect for natural law
2948,the greater the diversity of a population the more abstract the laws
2949,the more abstract the laws the easier they are to en­ act and the harder they are to enforce
2950,law emanates from custom
2951,a multiracial state has many customs and conse­ quently many lawsso many that law digests and commen­ taries can fill a sizable library
2952,small homogeneous states need fewer laws since they do not have to take into account the variant customs and habits of different population groups
2953,there are a multitude of incentives to lawbreaking in the human psychenvy hatred greed and vengeance to name a few all of which are easily aroused by poverty the conspicu­ ous consumption of plutocrats and unfair treatment in the 194 the ethnostate 195 courts
2954,heterogeneous states have an extra incentive for unlaw­ ful behaviorracial animosity
2955,in homogeneous states the populace being mono racial racial crime cannot exist
2956,the problem is that few such states are now to be found in the white world
2957,the ethnic mix washed up by waves of legal and illegal immigrants from nonwhite countries or from white countries whose race and culture differ greatly from the northern or northwestern european model bears a great deal of responsibility for the huge rise in the crime rate in the very nations whose populations not so long ago were known for their respect for law and order
2958,remove the ubiquitous racial animosity in multiracial states by removing the racial melange and the crime rate would plunge
2959,half the violent crimes in the united states are com­ mitted by blacks although blacks account for no more than 1213 of the population
2960,for every violent crime that american whites commit against american blacks blacks commit eight or nine violent crimes against whites
2961,in heterogeneous nations the jury system has difficulty functioning properly even where the average citizen has some appreciation of the law and is able to understand some of the courtroom legalese
2962,minority members of juries cannot escape feeling that minority defendants are kin or at the very least are being unfairly persecuted
2963,when a minority criminal is brought to trial in a city where demographic and residency considerations demand that the jury be largely composed of people of the same race as the ac­ cused it has frequently come to pass that ethnic sympathies produce a hung jury
2964,in the united states and some other western countries only one juror need decide that the defen­ dant is being prosecuted for insidious racial reasons to set him free even though all the other jurors found him guilty even though he is a professional criminal and even though the evi­ dence of his guilt is overwhelming
2965,such travesties of justice are all too common in trials of law­ breaking minority politicians and minority robbers and mug­ gers
2966,perhaps the worst effect of this unjust justice is the en­ couragement it offers a nonwhite criminal to ply his trade 196 the elhnoslale more regularly knowing that friends on the jury will let him off easily
2967,race in such a situation supersedes evidence
2968,even black judges are under some compulsion to give black defendants a break to avoid being accused of selling out their brothers 
2969,judgment by ones peers is supposed to mean judgment by ones equals
2970,people of different biological and environmental backgrounds are not equal no matter what is written in the lat­ est school textbooks the declaration of independence the constitution or recent supreme court decisions
2971,it is a selfevident truth that a wise judge can dispense justice more efficiently and more fairly than twelve good men and true
2972,but in these days of doctrinaire democracy it is still very difficult to convince people that a jury trial is a bad choice for whites caught up in the criminal justice system
2973,the law in these times is not so much concentrated on justice as it is on minority rights
2974,a wise squareshooting judge not only has a better under­ standing of the law but his experience on the bench gives him a better understanding of the evidence and how it should be weighed
2975,though solomons are always in short supply a judge can hand down a fair verdict in onetenth the time and at onehundredth the cost of jury trials an increasing number of which end in mistrials some for the reasons stated above
2976,in many presentday criminal proceedings the guilt or innocence of the person in the dock often fades into a sort of judicial subplot as the eyes and ears of judge jury and courtroom au­ dience focus on the forensic and theatrical jousting of the at­ torneys the heroes and villains of the legal drama
2977,it goes without saying that courtroom trials should have nothing to do with theater and everything to do with justice
2978,but the very presence of the jurors whose duties temporarily make them members of a privileged eliteto the best seats in the house so to speakmoves a trial into the realm least suited for due pro­ cess the realm of the stage
2979,a juryless trial presided over by a nononsense judge ban­ ishes drama or at least soap opera from the courtroom
2980,if for some inexplicable reason jurors of average intelligence are the ethnostate 197 better able to detennine a defendants innocence or guilt than a judge of superior intelligence who is thoroughly knowledg­ eable in the law then juries will render more judicious verdicts in an ethnostate
2981,vestigial racism will not tip the scales of jus­ tice and jurors will go about their tasks more objectively and less emotionally
2982,both prosecutors and defense attorneys are well aware that the race of the accused affects the minds of ju­ rors which is why they do everything they can to see that the racial composition of the jury is favorable to their case
2983,when federal prosecutors want to throw the book at a white defen­ dant they try him in the district of columbia where juries are overwhelmingly black
2984,if the defense attorneys client is white he moves heaven and earth to change the venue from a large city full of blacks to a small city full of whites
2985,all this costly legal legerdemain would be stillborn if the racism which clouds the legal process in multiracial nations was eliminated
2986,in an ethnostate where everyone involved in the legal processarresting officers judges prosecuting and defense attorneys witnesses and defendantswould belong to the same race the racial restraints on justice would not exist
2987,there are many subtle and not so subtle ways that racism af­ fects crime
2988,all too many burglaries and robberies in the united states and to a lesser extent in other western countries now end in the death of the victim just to satisfy the racial hostility of the anned robber
2989,white police officers have been shot dead when they stop nonwhite drivers for speeding or in­ terrupt a burglary in progress
2990,black arrestees are occasionally beaten unmercifully by white policemen who are driven up the wall by ghetto barbarians
2991,race riots in prisons are common events as are gang rapes of inmates usually of whites by nonwhites
2992,white policemen have to be very careful when they arrest minority members to avoid being accused of racism and police brutality
2993,such accusations can lead to their dismissal and even land them in jail
2994,white judges often give light sentences or none at all to young white first offenders because placing them in an over­ crowded jail with nonwhites could endanger their lives
2995,many perversions of justice might be avoided if lawmakers 198 the ethnostate would realize that different races respond differently to west­ ern laws
2996,one law for all often turns out to be a law for none because members of different races may have varying ideas as to what constitutes criminal behavior
2997,rather than try to squeeze all human groups into one legal framework some parts of which are bound to be accepted by one group and re­ jected by another the ethnostate would tailor its laws and law enforcement to the commonly shared behavioral traits of its homogeneous citizens
2998,when it tries to cater to the customs and instincts of a multi­ tude of different population groups law loses much of its moral force and fervor and under such conditions is trans­ formed into a plaything of sharp minds whose sole purpose aside from garnering flattering headlines and pocketing huge fees is to find ways of beating the system keeping criminals out of jail and cutting comers for financial moguls
2999,modem law consequently favors those sufficiently rich to hire these agile obfuscators who are generally people with scant affec­ tion for the society in which they prosper so handsomely
3000,less bound to custom and the moral aspects of law imbedded in custom lawyers become an occupational caste that floats above the social order both exploiting and perverting it
3001,custom would have a strong foothold in ethnostates thereby requiring less law and fewer lawyers
3002,what attorneys an ethnos­ tate can afford would be under heavy pressure to give up bar­ ratry persistent incitement of litigation
3003,since they would not be sidetracked by the ethnic factionalism rampant in multira­ cial societies lawyers would have more opportunity to concen­ trate on the pursuit of justice
3004,the absence of ethnic discord would also allow them to devote their time and talents to up­ holding and finetuning the law instead of turning it into a bag of legal tricks and ploys
3005,there is also the question of respect
3006,as law descends into a battle of witsthe present trend in the westthe public who watch or read about courtroom skirmishes lose respect for the justice system a state of mind which when it spreads through­ out the population inevitably leads to more crime
3007,this same loss of respect spills over into constitutional law the ethnostate 199 as minorities constantly demand radical changes not by the prescribed course of amendments or popular referenda but by frivolous legislation
3008,courtroom strife then moves into legisla­ tures as the law becomes hostage to lobbies media agitation and venal politicians
3009,
3010,in an ecumene of ethnostates some laws and legal proce­ dures would be extended to cover those regional continental or global issues that extend beyond an ethnostates bound­ aries
3011,such matters as air and sea pollution aging nuclear plants overpopulation and other threats to the environment are of supreme concern to every person on earth
3012,any action of one ethnostate that threatens the health and safety of people elsewhere on the planet must be promptly stopped and corrected by third parties
3013,the right of people of the same race and culture to control their own lives without outside interfer­ ence must not restrict or limit the power of global continental or regional bodies to safeguard the environment on which all living things depend and stamp out any incipient war the moment the first sparks begin to fly
3014,chapter 14 the media muddle events make news but news also makes events
3015,today be­ fore big decisions are made in domestic or foreign affairs the decisionmakers are careful to ask themselves how will it play in the media
3016,if they believe their agenda will look good in print or on television they will probably go ahead
3017,if it does not they may not
3018,raised on a diet of pseudohistory the ordinary layman has little difficulty swallowing the medias interpretations of cur­ rent eventsinterpretations motivated by the knowledge that to get his report in print or on television the contemporary newsman must first prove his membership in the handwring­ ing club of rampant egalitarianism
3019,how can we expect en­ lightenment from those whose every word must ab initio con­ form to a narrow ideology
3020,in any valid discussion of the media it is helpful to remem­ ber these points • columnists get many if not most of their ideas from other columnists
3021,columnists and editorial writers want readers to ingest their printed thoughts not develop thoughts of their own
3022,simpering acquiescence is preferred to boiling reaction
3023,• the closer a magazine or newspaper approaches the truth the smaller its circulation
3024,• there is no sorrier hypocrite than the newsman who fudges his facts so as not to wound the selfesteem of minorities 200 the elhnostate 201 and be accused of insensitivity
3025,• the fate reserved by the media for a snake that cannot shed its skin is reserved for the conservative who recants too late
3026,• in multiracial democracies the news business is an hour­ byhour accommodation to the liberal mindset
3027,to borrow a phrase from john keats where is the cave of quietude in a world that has become clangorous
3028,radio tele­ scopes are even picking up noise from outer space which heretofore had been considered as silent as it was cold and dark
3029,who would have thought that the soundless universe would be so full of cacophony
3030,will infinity turn out to be as noisy as our finite bedlam
3031,the western majorities the most silent of peoples are being drowned in raucous criticism and disparagement
3032,when a few courageous members of these majorities are occasionally dis­ posed to raise their voices and demur they are quickly out­ shouted
3033,it is understandable that decibels should multiply in times of war or catastrophe
3034,but even when peace manages to reign the noise level in the west is insufferable especially to ears that have become oversensitized to shrillness by centuries of vocal restraint
3035,we must learn to filter noise through our consciousness in such a way that we hear the sense of what is being said without the pejorative trimmings much as encrypted television signals destined for home satellite receivers have to be descrambled before we see the picture
3036,we must somehow build an inner audio and video receiver that immediately recognizes and au­ tomatically tunes out false ·news
3037,a first step is to amplify our skepticism
3038,nothing that emanates from a columnist an edito­ rial writer or a reporter should ever be taken for granted
3039,what is omitted from press reports and television news should be noted just as carefully as what is printed or broadcast
3040,the most effective and painless way to depropagandize the media is to make it a serious crime for any organization pres­ sure group or individual to attempt to distort the news by threats of political or financial retaliation
3041,the murder of truth 202 the ethnostate is as heinous a crime as homicide
3042,the ethnostate would have no antidefamation league or naacp to shape news report­ ing because there will be no racial minorities and hence no racial lobbies
3043,antimajority message films would disappear from television and movie houses not only because minority producers directors and writers would disappear but also be­ cause minority critics would no longer be around to puff up the work of their racial cousins
3044,most important the ostracism of books expressing majority viewpoints would end for the minority agitproppers would have moved to their own ethno­ states where without the racially inspired barbs their agitating would stir few hearts and minds and where to their distress and discomfort there would be no population group to pick on but their own
3045,public opinion is publicized opinion not the opinion of the public
3046,public policy is not the policy of the public but of powerful and affluent lobbies corporations and politicians
3047,the principal goal of media reform should be to localizeand deepennews
3048,canned press reports glorifying the american lifestyle are now being broadcast daily to more than one hun­ dred countries where they are translated into native languages and rebroadcast to people in the most distant hamlets
3049,the ef­ fect on the worlds surviving cultures is deadly
3050,to get every­ one thinking alike about the news is devastating to cultural growth and independence
3051,the media spin on events assumes much more importance than the events themselves
3052,hollywood becomes every earthlings capital and the wests most banal urban conglomeration los angeles becomes everyones our town
3053,the once highly articulated cultures of the west become the daily prey of liberal minority and homosexual scavengers whose cloacal and lascivious activities would shock and outrage the denizens of sodom and gomorrah
3054,the media in an ethnostate would be the voice of the people the authentic vox populi
3055,men and women of similar race and culture would have access to tv programs designed for them not their critics
3056,the days of minority pressure would be over because the pressurizers would no longer have a majority to pressure
3057,racism needs the other to exist
3058,when there is the ethnostate 203 no other there is no racism
3059,the reference here is to domestic racism not the kind that extends across frontiers
3060,the latter racism will probably always be with us
3061,but domestic racism is as dangerous as racism di­ rected abroad since it leads not only to massacres and wanton mayhem but to unstable governments and the lowest form of political pandering
3062,the absence of homegrown racism frees up people to spend their time in constructive pursuits not wasting precious moments sounding off against minorities and looking at every event through racetinted glasses
3063,to reduce the argument to a sentence monoracial countries are less like­ ly than multiracial countries to be permeated with racism
3064,chapter 15 the religious gene now that god is dead or what amounts to the same thing has come to be ignored it may be time to outgrow him
3065,when the movers and shakers of the country tum from the other­ worldly to the worldly and concentrate their worship on men even the worst of men it is fair to say that religion has reached a low ebb
3066,some of this cooling off of faith can be blamed on our old gods who were not too godly
3067,one of our most popu­ lar divinities was nailed to a cross beside two thieves
3068,another took pleasure in killing all the firstborn in what was then the worlds most highly advanced civilization
3069,another promised an afterlife enlivened by eternal sex
3070,none of these deities serves as a satisfactory role model for a sinful mankind des­ perately in need of uplifting
3071,the religion of the future if there is to be a serious religious revival will probably move away from anthropomorphism from jehovah christ mohammed and such newfangled messiahs as marx lenin gandhi chairman mao martin luther king jr and nelson mandela to a poetic worship of the mystery of being
3072,do we really need spurious miracles or miracle workers to stimulate our religious impulses
3073,the miracle of existence is more than sufficient
3074,any life form down to the simplest bacillus should be enough to satisfy all our inborn metaphysical cravings
3075,let our future theology focus on the wonders in us and around us not on the wonders far removed from us
3076,some may choose martin heidegger the atheist who made being into a god to 204 the ethnostate 205 be their john the baptist
3077,others may want no assistance or company as they brood about the unanswerable the incredible and the inexplicable
3078,religion has both united and divided mankind
3079,the higher religions though noted for teaching morality and altruism have all too frequently been the cause of devastating wars both between and within nations
3080,a homogeneous state with a state religion is likely to have more internal stability than a multira­ cial state with several religions if only because religious unity offers less opportunity for denominational hostility and bick­ ering
3081,the ethnostate would lay the groundwork for a coherent social order by basing statehood firmly on race and culture with the clear understanding that religion is a component of culture
3082,whenever two or more religious groups are striving for domination in a state the creation of two or more ethnos­ tates should be considered
3083,the universal religion which welcomes everyone to its bo­ som regardless of race and culture should be strenuously op­ posed by biological arguments for the evolutionary advantages of separatism
3084,as ethnostates become firmly established as population controls take effect and the average intelligence of the citizenry is raised the religious proselytizing that has so often led to the destruction of native cultures should diminish
3085,both religious and irreligious ethnostates would be able to live side by side in harmony if overtheborder proselytizing is forbidden and if the religion of one state and the irreligion of another truly reflect the feelings and aspirations of its believers or nonbelievers
3086,it might even come to pass in view of the favorable condi­ tions provided by ethnostates for the improvement of human understanding that organized religions will fade into limbo leaving only the legacy of their moral codes
3087,eventually men and women may achieve such mental growth that they will no longer have to be frightened or coaxed into behaving morally by clergymen preaching damnation from pulpits or whisper­ ing dubious advice in confessionals
3088,chance and necessity are not necessarily enemies of reli 206 the ethnostate gion
3089,indeed there was a god of chance in the greek pan­ theon
3090,as for polytheism we should not shrug off gustave le bons apothegm that stupid people are the most devout mono­ theists
3091,is a god of probability or a god of necessity too far removed from a god of science
3092,why should not nature the oldest divinity and technology the newest rule heaven and earth handinhand
3093,religion shortcircuits the aggressive instinct of man with stirring pleas for altruism and mercy
3094,unselfishness is certainly a useful trait when the time comes to bring order to barbarism
3095,but when civilization grows old altruism may open the door to barbarism of another type the type associated with decadence
3096,the barbarism of the undercivilized and the barbarism of the overcivilized are equally destructive
3097,the difference is that the barbarism of the undercivilized can be viewed as a correctable youthful defect since youngsters are more susceptible to edu­ cation than oldsters
3098,the barbarism of the overcivilized on the other hand is a sign of approaching death from which recu­ peration is nigh impossible
3099,one of the hardest if not the hardest task for any refonner revolutionary or race preservationist is to overturn a mass reli­ gion
3100,except in those rare moments in history when one reli­ gion succeeds another the most that can be done is to nibble around the edges of a prevailing faith and nudge it in a differ­ ent direction
3101,most practicing and believing christians can be persuaded to support political and social refonns that impose or reimpose moral standards that come out strongly against pornography sexual promiscuity and the breakdown of the criminal justice system
3102,but when the focus is on genetics christians have been known to waffle
3103,to an ethnostatist the positive and progressive elements of christianity are often canceled out by the negative reactionary elements
3104,accordingly christians cannot be counted on to be of any great help to ethnostate advocates
3105,any activist who in­ troduces the christian religion or any other religion in an eth­ nostate movement must be sure he has adequate support from the faithful
3106,the ethnostate 207 if it should become necessary to defend the ethnostate concept against the attacks of christian clerics they should not be characterized as christians but simply as critics
3107,whatever the tum of events every effort should be made not to stir up the hornets nest of religious politics
3108,history furnishes few examples of different races worship­ ping different gods existing side by side in a peaceful pros­ perous and unified social order
3109,states that are the arena of several religions only seem to have a degree of stability when one religion is dominant
3110,socalled universal religions have transcended racial and political boundaries but not always peacefully
3111,christianity in its various forms has been adopted at one time or another by several of the earths races
3112,islam expanding well beyond its arabic roots made large inroads in central asia indonesia and black africa
3113,buddhism born in india penetrated deeply into china japan and other parts of eastern and southeast asia
3114,although it has a nice resonance there is something misleading about the term universal religion
3115,examined more closely christianity is not as universal as it first appears
3116,roman catholics many protestant denominations eastern orthodox christian scientists mormons and seventh day adventists do not really worship at the same altar
3117,the most they have in common is a vague emotional allegiance to jesus christ and varying beliefs and disbeliefs in disjointed parts of the bible
3118,ultimately many of the special characteristics and teachings of a religion universal or parochial can be traced directly to race
3119,christianity is still a whitedominated faith despite its large and growing number of nonwhite communicants
3120,the major denominations that compose christianity have different racial backgrounds
3121,roman catholicism was the religion of the west when it was presided over by nordic feudal lords
3122,when the power of this aristocracy waned in southern europe the church was divided and protestantism took over in the north
3123,some anthropologists have pointed out that the boundary be­ tween catholic and protestant europe often approximates the racial boundary between nordics on the one side and alpines 208 the ethnostate and mediterraneans on the other
3124,the larger the state and the more numerous the population the greater the probability of religious divisiveness
3125,a homo­ geneous population is one effective means of eliminating this nettle of intramural religious disputes from the body politic
3126,the original demographic nucleus for every religion was ob­ viously one race
3127,as time passes and the faith spreads beyond its native borders it cannot escape assuming some of the char­ acteristics and dispositions of the converted aliens
3128,conse­ quently a universal religion soon breaks down into a patch­ work of religious denominations that have less and less in common
3129,unitarianism and catholicism though they both carry the label of christianity differ from each other in mat­ ters of theology and ritual as greatly as the two denominations differ from an islamic or buddhist sect
3130,racial and cultural values eventually modify and remodel an imposed religion though the time lag varies
3131,as the racial composition of a country changes over the centuries its reli­ gion will be diverted into new often esoteric channels
3132,re­ ligious mavericks and revolutionaries have learned from ex­ perience that attacks on rejigion have the habit of getting out of hand and changing into allout assaults on the long­ established manners and mores of the people at large
3133,every race or subrace which adopts a universal religion ei­ ther willingly or by force or by a combination of the two eventually puts its own imprint on it
3134,just as different genes are responsible for different physical traits they are also respon­ sible for different mental traits tastes predispositions emo­ tional reactions and all the other instinctbased activity of man
3135,it follows that not all races will have the same attitudes towards eternal life
3136,a spiritual consensus is much more likely to be achieved by one race than by several
3137,ethnostatists should treat the social gospel of jesus with great caution
3138,past events have proved that under certain circum­ stances christianity can easily become an altruistic trojan horse
3139,it invites outsiders no matter what their physical and mental qualifications
3140,to migrate in waves to countries where with a judicious amount of racial and minority networking the ethnostate 209 they are able to accumulate sufficient wealth and political pow­ er to subvert the social order established by the host popu­ lation
3141,today we see christian ministers and priests actively assist­ ing illegal aliens from mexico and other central american countries to cross the southern border of the united states and go about hispanicizing vast areas of texas and california
3142,christianity under the direction of dedicated churchmen has given a religious stamp of approval to undennining americas racial foundation
3143,a somewhat similar situation exists in west­ ern europe where legal and illegal immigration has become a major political economic and social issue
3144,the disputatious divines
3145,it is unfortunate that humans cannot rely solely on their instincts and abilities to establish and uphold the moral standards that make civilized life possi­ ble
3146,sadly throughout the ages most human beings have re­ quired a religion promising eternal bliss or eternal hellfire to keep them in line though their priests and parsons have been known to cross the line
3147,attempting to increase their power and riches and establish their ecclesiastical primacy religious potentates have practiced machiavellian diplomacy fomented rebellions and started wars as cruel and destructive as wars of conquest
3148,domestic religious conflicts are especially brutal as those who lived in the times of cromwell and luther learned to their sorrow
3149,though aggression is a wellknown perhaps necessary human trait religious aggression often extends well beyond the outer limits of pennissible social behavior
3150,all too many of historys greats have been more interested in capturing mens souls than in capturing their bodies
3151,separation of church and state has been one means of dampening religious aggression
3152,if evangelists and missionar­ ies are warned in advance that it is unlawful to meddle in poli­ tics and force their theology down the throats of the uncon­ vinced and unconverted they are more likely to confine their activities to matters of direct concern to their own church
3153,religious disputations create distrust hatred and even des 210 the ethnostate pair among believers and nonbelievers
3154,it defies common sense to force people of a puritanical bent to live side by side with members of a church that has lesbian ministers
3155,inte­ gration of this kind call it religious integration never really integrates
3156,all it does is increase tensions and multiply oc­ casions for violence
3157,if two or more standards of morality are promoted in the same state it makes it more difficult for the ordinary mortal to tell right from wrong
3158,people in the modern world are faced with too many prob­ lems as it is
3159,they do not need to experience the moral and physical turmoil associated with living in a multireligious state and being thrown into a welter of competing religions each representing and preaching differing sets of moral standards
3160,no matter how unappealing it may be to modern religionists an ethnostate would be free of clergymen debating who is on the right track to heaven
3161,whatever we think about religion it is going to be around until human beings move much further up the evolutionary scale
3162,it has a pertinacity even in those officially atheistic communist states which deified their leaders and imposed a highly ramified marxist theology on the masses
3163,until men and women arrive at the stage where they under­ stand that moral standards derive from the head and the heart not from on high it should be the states job to see that the moral aspects of religion are treated with respectful deference
3164,it will be much easier to accomplish this in a state not divided into hostile population groups
3165,race is a binding force
3166,cul­ ture is a binding force
3167,religion when it is not fragmenting into a lot of squabbling sects can be a binding force
3168,morality from science
3169,the time has come for westerners to stop partitioning science and morality
3170,moral predispositions have developed into rules and systems of behavior that have 
3171,survival value for groups as well as individuals
3172,perhaps the popularity of religion among all races can be explained by mans subconscious recognition of the importance of morality and the importance of religion in institutionalizing morality
3173,the britishborn psychologist raymond cattell believes that the ethnostate 211 man or at least civilized man has progressed to where science can supplant religion as the primary source of morality
3174,religion he asserts carries a lot of unsavory baggagecrank theories immoral history corrupt leadership deviate church­ men
3175,science largely free of such impediments is far more qualified to address the moral component of man
3176,cattell advises churches to stop scaring people into becom­ ing moral and let reason not fear convince their congrega­ tions that morality is the way to go
3177,but first the social sciences must live up to their name and become true sciences
3178,then the psychologists and sociologists instead of acting like priests and gurus as many still do can dig deeper into the roots of behavior and come up with research that should put morality on a firm scientific footing
3179,rules can then be formulated which will allow the social order to be organized in such a way that much of the crime and misbehavior that has slowed hu­ man progress over the centuries will be largely eliminated
3180,science by actual tests will be able to diagnose the morality quotient of humans at the earliest possible age making it pos­ sible to give special attention to the moral weaklings
3181,both by setting up rules for moral conduct that are based on vast amounts of behavioral research and by perfecting tests to measure a persons predisposition for sticking to the straight and narrow social science should emerge from the doldrums and begin to play a crucially important part in forging a better world
3182,a moral scientist can be relied upon to produce good sci­ ence
3183,he will not concern himself with developing deadlier forms of poison or more powerful thermonuclear bombs
3184,he will not be morally neutral
3185,he will spend as much time and ef­ fort inching science into the domain of morality as he does inching morality into the domain of science
3186,does religion in the west have a future
3187,it is reasonable to suppose it will slowly lose some of its popularity as the myster­ ies of nature which used to fill people with religious awe be­ come less mysterious owing to the quantum leaps of science
3188,as for the moral component of religion it too may become less important when the day comes that a geneticist may be 212 the ethnostate able to engineer or breed morality by removing or adding spe­ cific genes to the female egg or male sperm before concep­ tion
3189,multiracial states would be much more reluctant than ethnostates to undertake such earthshaking research which would almost certainly be denounced as racist by the thought police
3190,morality vs immorality
3191,one problem with obscenity is the difficulty of pinpointing it
3192,what is obscene to some is per­ fectly acceptable to others
3193,what offends a woman may not bother a man
3194,laws against obscenity which come and go in cycles vary with time and place
3195,once the floodgates of ob­ scenity are open they are hard to close
3196,what occurs naturally and normally in a barnyard is obscene in a living room
3197,barnyard behavior and civilized behavior are at opposite poles
3198,when they begin to converge its back to the barnyard
3199,a few superior men have raised masses of lesser men to almost superhuman levels
3200,but the strain is so great and the downward pull of our animal nature so strong that decline and degeneration quickly set in
3201,from then on it is a march down­ hill punctuated by intermittent eras of partial recovery
3202,mea­ sure the amount of obscenity both subrosa and acceptable at any milestone along this march and you will have a fair idea of the societys health
3203,nearly everyone agrees that children should be protected from obscenity but many intellectuals of a liberal bent insist that almost no limit should be set on what is seen heard and read by adults
3204,they reinforce their argument by reminding their critics it takes only minimal effort not to buy or read an offensive book switch off the tv or remove their eyes from erotic or cloacal graffiti
3205,the bitter truth is that huge salaciously worded newspaper headlines on display in kiosks and sudden offcolor intrusions in supposedly innocuous tv programs are visual insults that only the blind can avoid
3206,one commonly proposed way to regulate obscenity is to apply what are called community standards
3207,but in a multi­ racial state there are several communities hence several stan­ dards
3208,when it is a matter of defining the parameters of the ethnostate 213 obscenity a better and fairer job can be done by those who share a common culture than by a potpourri of heterogeneous groups which are sure to have contradictory opinions of what does and what does not go too far
3209,the most troubling thing about obscenity is its power to coarsen young minds
3210,the adolescent who views the ani­ malistic cavortings in xrated films may never have the same opinion of men and women again
3211,he may never be able to believe in beatrice if he should read dante or relish the prim literary masterpieces of jane austen
3212,he has seen men and women acting like beasts
3213,once shattered his panglossian view of his fellow human beings may never be recaptured
3214,quite possibly the coarsening effect of obscenity gives an animalistic twist to the human psyche
3215,if it does then it follows that unlimited freedom of expression may have actually lowered the wattage of the idealism that over millennia has given a radiant glow to human thought
3216,obscenity is not a black eye that clears up with time
3217,it is a permanent wound
3218,some may be nonchalant when exposed to it
3219,socalled tough hombres may brush it off
3220,but it leaves a lasting stain
3221,lurid exhibitions of every form of physical con­ tact between members of the opposite sex between members of the same sex between old men and young boyssexual encounters often spiced with sadism and masochismhave a sharp impact on human sensitivities
3222,the artistic tastes of men and women assaulted by daily or weekly exhibitions of hard­ core eroticism cannot help but be corroded
3223,persons fed highly seasoned food over a period of time find it hard to re­ turn to a bland diet
3224,the widespread availability of porno­ graphic films literature and art tends to make them habit­ forming
3225,as we move back or are moved back closer to the ape the fragile cocoon of civilization may come completely undone
3226,barely suppressed demons are always ready to fly out of the pandoras box buried in every human being
3227,by setting high standards of conduct and morality and by outlawing most manifestations of obscenity high civilizations can delay the moral degeneration that inevitably sets in when the tastemakers let down their guard
3228,as the laws against ob 214 the ethnostate scenity fall in abeyance there will always be some individuals who will push them to their farthest limits just as the drug addict continually increases his dose to obtain his high
3229,different races and cultures have different tolerances for obscenity
3230,in a multiracial society one or more population groups may indulge in what members of other population groups would consider impennissible behavior
3231,much of black rap is judged obscene by whites fearful of the outright calls for rape and murder contained in some of the doggerel
3232,some re­ ligious denominations tend to be more straitlaced than others
3233,these varying interpretations of obscenity have produced se­ vere and lasting disagreements even armed confrontations throughout human history
3234,different ideas about obscenity have been known to exacer­ bate class and religious conflicts
3235,the puritans against the stuart monarchs in the british isles and the peasant revolts in medieval europe are two examples
3236,obscenity was a burning issue in such conflicts because the rich had the means and the leisure to act more lasciviously and scandalously than the poor whose dawntodusk labor left little time for philandering though much time for envy
3237,obscenity as might be expected reaches lower depths in multiracial societies than in homogeneous ones
3238,the contrast between the sexual mores of the early roman republic and the late roman empire offers a clear picture of the animalism that sets in as a society loses its racial core
3239,compare the moral standards of the united states in the last century to those in the last half of the 20th
3240,the radical decline in moral behavior was highly correlated with the decline in the number and pro­ portion of the britishdescended population and the increasing presence and influence of minorities
3241,an ethnostate would help curb obscenity for the simple rea­ son that its moral standards would be those of one population group not several
3242,it is a far easier task to regulate the conduct of a monoracial than a multiracial society
3243,the greeks had a word for pornography and devoted much attention to the subject as have all higher civilizations
3244,what the ethnostate 215 varies over the ages is its quantity and availability
3245,those few who could afford to visit the bagnios of shanghai at the tum of the century were able to find as much smut as the masses could find in the everything goes weimar republic of the 1920s
3246,in the 1980s we could switch to an adult channel on cable tv or drive a halfmile or so to the nearest adult bookstore to rent or buy a videotape that would make a decadent roman salivate
3247,today pornography is everywhere
3248,yesterday it was harder to find but it was always there
3249,the current pattern of instant availability applies not just to pornography but to practically all manifestations of the new permissiveness
3250,drugs in western countries used to be the vice of the rich
3251,now large numbers of addicts can be found in the middle and lower classes including the criminal underclass
3252,the cliche that any amount of lubricity is acceptable pro­ vided it is presented or accomplished artistically does not hold water
3253,when pornography shows up in some form of enter­ tainment or art that supposedly has as the supreme court would say some redeeming social value the persons exposed to it forget all about the art and focus exclusively on the scatological content
3254,the degree of pornographys penetration into the collective conscience is a bellwether of decline
3255,the youthful period of a culture generally allows no more than sporadic doses of healthy bawdiness
3256,perversion is scorned and perverts ridi­ culed
3257,signs of cultural aging are apparent in the transforma­ tion of poetic drama into prurient mimes the fate of the the­ ater in rome
3258,today in spite of the dialogue that seems to demand a prescribed number of fourletter words films and television dramas are hardly more than mimes with their obligatory nudity and bedroom gambols
3259,pornography can never be totally eliminated sex being the underpinning of all mammalian existence
3260,but history demon­ strates time and again that pornography can be contained and controlled and many of its bad effects avoided by keeping it out of easy reach
3261,if it is costly confined to special areas and obscenity laws are enacted and enforced it will find a much smaller audience
3262,216 the ethnostate a small homogeneous state is better able to control pornog­ raphy than a large heterogeneous state with larger areas to monitor and a diverse citizenry that cannot agree on the boundaries of obscenity
3263,peer pressure which would abound in ethnostates is a very effective deterrent to aberrant social behavior
3264,the wave of pornography now flooding the west is only possible because the laws that legalize it and the permissiveness that feeds it have overridden western cultural restraints and exposed hundreds of millions to the mindrotting effects of obsessive sexuality
3265,perhaps obscenity can be best defined as a catalyst of social deterioration
3266,the moral schism
3267,most of us subscribe to two ethical sys­ tems one for us and one for them
3268,the us can be as few as the members of a family or as many as the population of an entire country
3269,war generally makes the us larger in number and more closely bound
3270,peace and prosperity have the opposite effect
3271,two or more races have difficulty fitting into an overall us picture
3272,similar language nationhood and citizenship accentuate the us but seldomor at least not for longare these factors able to overcome the them who belong to a different culture or ethnicity
3273,in a multiracial nation us and them are omnipresent despite the integrating pressures of law language education and common geography
3274,social bonds within any society must be based on some ele­ ment of mutual trust
3275,in the average ethnic group these bonds are usually strong
3276,behavior that might be allowed even en­ couraged towards outsiders is not tolerated within the group
3277,the long record of human ups and downs advertises the stem lesson that a population group generally has one moral code for itself and another for everyone else
3278,cheating is considered a crime when practiced against mem­ bers of ones own group
3279,it is less of a crimeit can even earn applausewhen the person who is cheated is of another race
3280,the same double standard is applied to many other aspects of moral behavior
3281,the culprit who commits a crime within the the ethnostate 217 group and is fiercely punished may be honored for doing the same to a foreigner
3282,morality has hard going when it is cynically manipulated by those who do to outsiders what they would not do to each other
3283,in a pluralistic state there is a constant struggle among the various population groups for more political power not only to get their merited or unmerited share of the nations material wealth but to establish legislative and judicial safeguards against discrimination and secondclass citizenship
3284,such con­ flicts and confrontations are usually exacerbated by appeals to race
3285,freed from troublesome and divisive racial differences by its homogeneity the ethnostate is able to bypass the social po­ litical and economic fractionalization that is aided and abetted by ethnic clashes
3286,since every bomb must be detonated by a fuse if the fuse multiracialism is absent the bomb racial strife wont detonate
3287,the double standards arising from the ethics of us and them are inoperative in an ethnostate
3288,the majority moralist is in a quandary in a multiracial sce­ nario
3289,his conscience prods him to argue for what amounts to the devaluation or dilution of his own culture in order to pro­ vide more opportunities for a better and fuller life for the less fortunate
3290,he is not even sure that the objects of his concern will profit from the help he wants to offer them no matter how frequently unselfishly and bounteously such help is offered
3291,yet he insists on expanding his altruism to lengths which may eventually cause a sharp deterioration in the character of the very people he is trying to help
3292,population groups fare best when they draw their strength from within
3293,when people of one culture meddle in the culture of another the ensuing hy­ bridization may erase some of the most valuable elements of both cultures and accentuate some of the worst
3294,if we have to choose between truth and moralitythey are not the sameit is generally easier to choose the latter especially if we are prepared to coat it with a thick gloss of sticky sentimentality
3295,truth wrote martin luther in his darkest mood goes abegging while shakespeare assures us that eventually it will come to life
3296,the bard is on target
3297,218 the ethnostate sooner or later truth wll catch up to those who try to conceal it by donning a mambrinos helmet of morality
3298,truth informs us about the innate differences in population groups that all such groups are to some degree biologically typecast
3299,but when one segment of a countrys population knows its deficiencies and another segment is aware of its ge­ netic perks the ensuing mix of frustration and arrogance pre­ sents a constant danger to the public order
3300,no matter how well the facts of biological diversity are concealed by the egalitar­ ian smoke screen of a universal religion they will nevertheless manifest themselves again and again in human affairs
3301,we all may be equal in the eyes of god but only the willfully astig­ matic will say we are equal in the eyes of man
3302,given a large boost by christianity by the political religion known as liberalism and by the human instinct known as altru­ ism almost all western countries since the end of world war ii have taken a finn stand gainst racial discrimination
3303,laws were passed guaranteeing equal rights in many cases more than equal rights to minorities
3304,it was all so moral that no one could stand up and oppose the legislation without being shouted down as a bigot
3305,in the united states after the desegregation of public educa­ tion had become the law of the land and the supreme court had ordered all americans to be colorblind the unexpected happenedunexpected that is to moralists
3306,when blacks were openly discriminated against they could blame their failures their poverty and their low place on the social ladder on white racism
3307,but even after the job and educational roadblocks had been removed by court order and civil rights legislation most blacks still remained mired in backwardness
3308,who or what was to blame
3309,liberal apologists and black politicians advanced the argument that the effect of centuries of discrimination could not be eliminated in a few years
3310,this was a weaker argument than the one attributed to lack of equal opportunity
3311,though the nurturists would not agree it introduced a kind of latterday lamarckism into the picturethe inheritance of acquired characteristics
3312,the black father and mother having been the victims of discrimination in slavery times and conse the ethnostate 219 quently unable to use the full range of their talents passed on to their offspring the genes that had been affected by these limitations
3313,darwin would have passionately disagreed but darwinism was superseded in such cases by the nurturism of leftwing social anthropologist margaret mead and her mentor franz boas
3314,if centuries of discrimination had been holding back blacks then common decency and morality demanded that they be given some form of compensationsuch as affirmative action a program and policy that went well beyond equal opportunity into the realm of special privilege
3315,the black was no longer to be treated as an equal but as an adult problem child who needed special help to succeed in a world not of his making
3316,in a sense this was the old jim crow argument without a pa­ ternalist government standing by with waivers to allow for the inability of blacks to catch up
3317,but this backhanded concession to genetics was only acknowledged in private by the more intelligent and openminded members of the integrationist lobby
3318,publicly they said that after a certain length of time­ never specifiedblacks as a result of special treatment and disproportionate attention would finally be on a real par with other races and be able to make it on their own
3319,having seen how little special privileges have done for blacks in the united states canada and britain one does not have to be a brilliant economist to predict that all projects for black betterment would fail as badly as the misbegotten equal opportunity programs
3320,as the black masses continue to fail to match white performance they and their advocates will con­ tinue to demand more laws more favors and more special treatment until quotas racebased promotions and minority setasides have been institutionalized throughout most of the west
3321,ultimately this reverse racism was bound to produce a political backlash
3322,in america millions of southern and blue­ collar whites deserted the democratic party perceived to be the party of negroes and hispanics while black riots and shooting sprees recruited previously independent voters for the gop perceived to be the party of law and order
3323,in britain the criminal behavior of west indian blacks has strengthened the 220 the ethnostate political muscle of the tory right wing
3324,in france violent con­ frontations of african blacks and north african moslems with the police have succeeded in making jeanmarie le pens national front into europes largest most active and most influential antiimmigration party
3325,other western countries such as canada australia and new zealand are only be­ ginning to learn what awaits them if they do not shut the door on the millions of nonwhites clamoring to enjoy the good life they were never able to create for themselves
3326,when the time comes as it surely must that all the legislative and economic measures giving a leg up to blacks are finally stripped away in a tidal wave of reaction or counterrevolution or when in the worst case blacks actually assume power in a western nation they will soon be back where they startedat the bottom of the economic and social heap
3327,either whites will drive them out of office or the nation will be transformed into a third world basket case
3328,it is even possible that there will be a repeat performance of what blacks did when they took over haiti nearly two centuries ago and massacred every white man woman and child they could get their hands on
3329,the final spreadsheet of affirmative action will show that a halfcentury or so of vast western expenditures on racial inte­ gration will have gone down the drain
3330,the belief in innate racial differences at least in regard to the capabilities of blacks hispanics and middle easterners to establish industrial high­ tech democratic societies will be engraved more firmly than ever in the consciousness of the average westerner who may finally summon up enough courage to speak his mind on this issue and stop it from being monopolized and distorted by an academic and mediawise caste
3331,in the end the great 20thcentury orgy of false morality and untruth will prove to be one more tragedy or tragic farce for the history books
3332,affirmative actionthe british call it posi­ tive discriminationwas a mild social palliative in the short term but in the long term embarrassingly and dangerously counterproductive
3333,creating more problems than it solved it had the effect of disproving what it set out to prove
3334,worst of all it raised false expectations in the hearts and minds of the ethnostate 221 countless millions of whites and blacks who later were trauma­ tized by the demoralization that sets in when high hopes are dashed
3335,the ethnostate is not the enemy of morality
3336,it is the enemy of false morality in particular the false morality that permeates and attempts to justify equalitarianism
3337,by profiting from the many advantages that come with racial and cultural separatism the ethnostate should do more than any other form of gov­ ernment to soften the harsh biological facts of racial differ­ ences while in no way denying them
3338,the black in his own land whether in the new or old world would no longer be in daily personal contact with whites
3339,he would escape most of the competitive struggles that have so constantly thwarted him in whitedominated lands
3340,in a negro ethnostate the black would be able to think much more about himself and much less about whitey
3341,he would be free to go his own political cultural and social way without whites setting up goals he could never achieve and standards he could never matchand never wanted to match
3342,in his own state the black would be living and working in an environment in which he not whites would make the rules
3343,there is no better way of alleviating the blacks lack of self­ respect no better means of liberating him from the frustration of competing with whites in white societies than to remove him from the interracial interface
3344,the same kind of separatism with some modifications is appropriate for other minorities in western countries and for asian minorities in the east
3345,westerners although they have often been the architects of racial confrontations have suffered enough from them
3346,what other political configuration than the ethnostate can provide a more effective framework for ending racial conflicts the old­ est ugliest most destructive form of human behavior
3347,chapter 16 in sum
3348,• • westerners need to put on a new pair of glasses with which to view the world knowing full well that for an introductory pe­ riod new glasses are an uncomfortable fit
3349,even if the west or a small segment of the west collapses as a result of the multira­ cialism and multiculturalism imbedded in liberal theology minority dynamism and the unheroic inertia of majorities some of the ideas presented in this book may help prevent similar disasters from occurring in a more distant future
3350,all nations and empires eventually expire some by conquest and absorption some by internal fragmentation some by ra­ cial and cultural suicide
3351,if handled wisely the breakup could be a positive step towards a higher civilization for the heirs
3352,wisdom which is fertilized by liberty flourishes most bril­ liantly on a small stage
3353,an ethnostate that restricts its territory and population to manageable proportions can concentrate on the truly important tasks of western man how to continue his evolutionary progress while beset by enemies real and imag­ ined who want to put an end to him
3354,it is important for everyone not just westerners that the west does not go under
3355,if it does the rest of the world may accompany it
3356,it is possible that the appearance of a higher type of man rests on the survival of western man
3357,selfsufficiency self­ determination and cultural and political autonomy are ideas that as the song has it are blowing in the wind
3358,suppressed population groups are trying to break away from first world 222 the ethnostate 223 nations and from what remains of the crumbling second marxist world
3359,the third world is bursting at the seams with diverse nonwhite governments struggling desperately to give their hungry populations a passable standard of living
3360,the fourth world not often described as such consists almost entirely of tribal peoples who have their own traditional cul­ tures and gene pools but next to no political and economic infrastructure
3361,the principal theme of this study has been the need to create what the author has chosen to call ethnostates and to reap the many benefits that would derive therefrom
3362,among many other advantages ethnostates would serve as lifeboats to keep whites alive until they recover their spirits and morale and again take their place in the vanguard of the great evolution­ nary trek
3363,when the leading characters are written out of a play noth­ ing remains but empty dialogue
3364,should whites whose suicidal birthrate has declined to well below the replacement level go under the trek might come to a crashing halt
3365,this racial angle has been completely missed or deliberately ignored by the bioregionalists devolutionaries and greens who focus on saving nature and the nonhuman environment but are not at all concerned about the quality and type of people who would inhabit what they have been so ardently trying to save
3366,the ethnostatist thinks first about people then about the environment not vice versa
3367,this strange reversal of priorities by the environmentalists has been one reason for this book
3368,whites should be saved not for their own sake but because of their special place in the order of things
3369,in all the innum­ erable galaxies out there none may have any life form as ad­ vanced as homo sapiens
3370,because they are that division of homo sapiens most capable of carrying on the faustian adven­ ture whites are precious commodities
3371,the chinese and j apan­ ese may run out of steam in a whiteless world since the greater part of their science and technology has been cribbed from the west
3372,the human record certifies that the race that has lifted itself 224 the ethnostate higher above the ape than any other is the one that has a patent on white genes
3373,this is where the ethnostate enters the picture
3374,it is perhaps the only peaceful and sensible means of assuring white survival in an increasingly antiwhite nonwhite world
3375,withdrawal and reorganization devolution to ensure evolution would seem to be the most logical and intelligent road to salvation for a peopleand possibly a planetfacing extinction
3376,appendix probable and improbable ethnostates in north america cumberland
3377,the territory of virginia kentucky and ten­ nessee centered around the cumberland gap daniel boone country
3378,population is largely scotsirish and english
3379,state­ hood would be a first step towards ethnostatehood
3380,northern california
3381,if the state were divided in two the northern part would become the homeland for white califor­ nians minus white unassimilable minorities
3382,the multiracial multicultural southern part would be dominated by hispanics and a mix of other nonwhite minorities
3383,azthin
3384,the american southwest under the notungentle prodding of hispanics would secede from the union and be­ come an independent mexamerica
3385,ironically this could be interpreted as a latterday enactment of the 1915 plan of san diego by mexicans which called for a liberation force of mexicans negroes and indians to drive the whites out of texas california arizona new mexico and colorado
3386,blacks would get oklahoma utah wyoming kansas nebraska and south dakota for their part in the project

3428,america is replete with serious and frivolous suggestions for devolution
3429,not content with state­ hood a considerable number of americans are opting for forms of autonomy that are not too far removed from inde­ pendence

3440,another slavic country czechoslovakia has split into a czech and a slovak state
3441,in western europe there have been no drastic changes but almost everywhere various groups and lobbies are pushing for some fonn of decentralization whether it is restoration of the old provinces or outright secession to confonn with racial and cultural boundaries

3460,never­ theless the country has such a long history of autonomous or semiautonomous provinces and its people speak so many dif­ ferent dialects that the spirit of ethnostatism must be alive in many hearts particularly in bavaria once a powerful kingdom in its own right
3461,in this context it is well to remember that germany did not become one nation until 1866 the ethnostate 231 scandinavia
3462,one of two examples of divisiveness in this part of the world is the laplanders some 32000 strong who live in northern norway sweden and the kola peninsula of russia

3520,cambridge belknap press 1975 from the foreword  in an earlier book the dispossessed majority the author was hopeful but not too hopeful that a sharp white backlash to minority racism and cultural degeneration might save what appeared to be the doomed united states
3521,twenty years ago he still believed it possible that his moribund country could revive clean out its political and cultural augean stables and establish a pax americana that would herald a new age of peace plenty and progress
3522,now that more than two decades have passed events are proving that america as we have known it is beyond saving
3523,the majority that is the northern and western european elements of the population has lost whatever chance it had to recapture the country it ruled for more than two centuries
3524,defeatist as it may sound this does not mean it is too late to save the majority as a people  what is called for is a new form of government that would transform socially destructive into socially constructive forces
3525,race now actively tearing countries apart might be helpful in putting them back together but this time in the form of auton­ omous relatively selfsufficient collectivities that the author has chosen to designate as ethnostates
3526,since nothing else seems to be working since every new day brings with it new demographic horrors a little rethinking of the fundamental themes and axioms of modem statecraft might be in order
3527,although the author is an american he will not confine his remarlcs to what used to be his country but will aim many of them overseas
3528,inescapably however his emphasis will be on the united states not only because of his birth and up­ bringing but also because what is happening in the  western world in these parlous times is happening first in america
3529,to employ spenglers term but without accepting his organic view of history the decline of the west is accel­ erating faster in the united states than elsewhere
3530,consequent­ ly the suggestions advanced in this book for halting and reversing this decline should have the highest priority for the american majority the most threatened of white population groups everywhere south african whites excepted  the ethnostate is wilmot robertsons third book
3531,his first the dispossessed majority was published in 1972 and updated editions came out every two or three years thereafter
3532,as of 1992 more than 100000 hardcover softcover and condensed paperback copies had been sold
3533,in 1974 the authors second book ventilations a collection of essays was published
3534,the ethnostate was composed in the years 198592 while robertson continued his work as editor of instauration a monthly magazine dedicated to the small group of white ameri­ cans who are trying to prevent what was once their country from becoming a 20th­ century downthetubes sybaris and a 21st­ century brazil
3535,instauration is now in its 18th year
