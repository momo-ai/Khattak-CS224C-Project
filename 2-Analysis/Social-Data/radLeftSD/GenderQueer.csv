1,So I think I might be Genderfluid,"So I think I'm genderfluid but idk if it's the right term for how I feel

Hi everyone hope you are all doing well,

So um yeah I think I'm genderfluid and I've said I am for the past year and while I know it isn't a huge deal idi if I'm like using that right.

To give some more context I am a 25 year old, pansexual, AMAB, and I don't really dress fem other then cute underwear and stuff but I love the idea of it, and it makes me euphoric to think about, and I play VRchat a lot and being in avatars that I can do both masculine and feminine clothing is just makes me feel so wonderful and happy because I'm obviously a lot more brave online about stuff. 

When it comes to pronouns I love any of them and have times when I talk with someone that I encourage them to use feminine pronouns and stuff, and I've had friends even offer to try it out long term to see how I feel about it and I love it. 

Even when I was a kid I had a lot of feminine things I liked, like I didn't always wanna play dress up as a boy, and one of my favorite board games was Pretty Pretty Princess.

I also even now love the idea of painting my nails and trying makeup and stuff, and to describe how I look I'm essentially a bear and I love being one. So um yeah, if anybody could kinda help me understand or maybe help me in the right direction I'd absolutely love it.",11kdbi3,11,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/11kdbi3/so_i_think_i_might_be_genderfluid/,['welcome my fellow gender fluid buddy']
2,I'm having a gender crisis üôÉ,"Okay, so I need a bit of advice cuz I have no idea what to do. When I'm by myself I'm usually vibing. I just do me depending on how I feel that day and everything is fine. My problem is that whenever I'm around someone I'm romantically attracted to I tend to change for that person. So at one point I was convinced that I was trans. I was so confident that I had finally found it until I started to like this guy who is painfully straight. That's when I started to question myself and started dressing more femme around him and stuff just so he'd like me. But then there is also this girl I mildly like and so I started dressing more masc to match her type and whenever they're around and I dont dress to match their tastes I feel super self conscious and I start to question my gender all over again and ugh idk what to do. Help..?",11kgpo5,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/11kgpo5/im_having_a_gender_crisis/,"['Hmm, maybe it could be good to explore this with a therapist!

You don‚Äôt need a label either! But I think like exploring that need to accommodate someone else‚Äôs wants/likes/desires could be helpful for u in general & w ur gender']"
3,Figuring shit out AFAB,"Im AFAB and have been pretty tomboyish since I was a kid with phases of preppy or like egirl moments when I wanted to fit in. Ive known that I want top surgery for a long time but I also know thats not really an option for me so I use binders now (safely). Im confused as to what to do because I want to present as nonbinary but I also always wanted to be ""pretty"". Validation as someone who grew up thinking that was the only way to I could fit in or be wanted is pretty hard to shake. I also know I have a certain extent of privilege being a generally attractive AFAB and facially femme presenting person. I just dont know where to go from here. I wish I could be reborn as a guy because I know even if I transition everyone will still think of me as a girl and I wish I could just start over with no ever having started percieving me as a girl in the first place.

I'm AMAB, so it is different, but I also used to wish I was just born the opposite gender, that I would never be accepted as my preferred gender.

Do what gives you joy. \n\nI'm not going to lie, it's hard to be trans right now. It feels like the whole world is against us. The transphobes are essentially terrorists. They're trying to frighten us out of transitioning. Transitioning and just existing as a trans person are acts of defiance.

I know I suffer from gender dysphoria. It‚Äôs been 8 years of this shit and despite all the other things that have changed in my life, the gender dysphoria is still here. Still, I feel privileged in my current body. I feel as though any cis woman would be happy to have a body like mine. I‚Äôm thin and generally well proportioned. And I know that I‚Äôm very privileged to inhabit what many would consider to be a very acceptable body. It has taken me years to reckon with the idea that even though this body is beautiful from an outside perspective (and I can even admire it in the way I might admire another persons body) it doesn‚Äôt feel like mine. The me inside is much more masculine, and I forget I inhabit this body until I look in the mirror or someone calls me ‚Äúshe‚Äù and I get pangs of discomfort, like somehow I‚Äôm not being seen. I‚Äôm scared of transitioning. I‚Äôm scared of discrimination and giving up this privilege that I‚Äôve had for so long. But I can‚Äôt keep denying the true self I feel inside anymore. I may find that hormone therapy isn‚Äôt right for me after trying, but I‚Äôve decided that I have to at least try. I‚Äôve been thinking about it too long for it to not be a viable option.']"
4,My So-Called Life & Ricky,"I found the box set of MY SO-CALLED LIFE when I was an angst ridden teen on a shelf in a thrift store. The teenage drama genre was new to me. Seeing a gay boy presented nuanced and compassionately blew my mind ü§Ø

5,Identity or expression?,"Does ""genderqueer"" refer strictly to a gender identity or does it extend to gender expression as well? I've seen it explained both ways. What does genderqueer mean to you?

6,What is the difference between queer and gay?,"Hi, I‚Äôm still getting the hang of pronouns and sexualities. I‚Äôm too afraid to ask my friends bc I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll offend them (one is queer female and the other is gender-fluid).

8,Genderfuckery and NB identity,"Just a brain dump and opening it to the floor for discussion...

I [51M] have been cross dressing pretty much since I was in my early teens, until the last 5 years nearly always in private (but anything fancy dress was always me femmed up, including my practice Passing Out parade from Navy Basic Training).

With my (for 9 years, 51F) partner, its grown a lot - I cross-dress for kink parties, I've gone into the city with her wearing a skirt, I've been painting my nails for 4 years (inc at work), and she's even bought me my own lingerie (corsets, stockings, knickers) for Christmas, birthdays and 'just because' ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm unambiguously male. 190lb, sporty (if dad bod), bearded. I'm happy with that, but while my masculinity is dialled up loud, I'm proud of my feminine side, which isn't limited to dress.

I'm bi (romantic & physically attracted to women, less so to men, but still a lot), kinky, vers, switchy and enthusiastic.

I've been wondering recently if I *am* NB. And that's a challenge at my age üòÇ

Is there a point at which gender non-conformity eases into NB? And am I there? 

I can hear my response to someone else posting this... 'Labels are constraints. Be yourself and stop thinking about them.' For me, identity is measured on a whole range of spectra - presentation, romantic & physical attraction, identity, and the whole range of Genderbread aspects. But labels are also a comfort blanket until you relax about them, and I'm now thinking about it enough to not be relaxed about this aspect. 

https://www.genderbread.org/",11gzx6d,67,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/11gzx6d/genderfuckery_and_nb_identity/,"['I was talking about this a lot with my partner this past week, after someone at an event - a Pok√©mon event - related to her by suggesting sort of ‚Äúare we in similar costumes bc you‚Äôre also an anxious enby?‚Äù To which my partner kinda gestured to me (we are both anxious, but she‚Äôs cis and I‚Äôm trans). We had a good talk with them.\n\n(They were both dressed as Umbreon, for the fans.)\n\nMy partner is definitely gender transgressive and does not conform universally to cis feminine expectations. But we both wondered, what would it take for her to actually consider herself non-binary? A difficult feeing to quantify.\n\nShe grew up feeling like a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù kind of girl/woman, and knew from an early age she was bisexual/queer. She‚Äôs had tons of different fashion phases, covering ‚Äútomboy‚Äù as a teenager and by the time we met in college, being more femme. In our middle adulthood now, she‚Äôs occasionally high femme in formal wear and we enjoy dressing that way together with me suited up etc. She also steals my clothes almost as often as I wear them, working from home üòÜ and she is just as comfortable in my hoodies and sweats. \n\nUltimately, she came to the conclusion that her style also comes more so out of expressing herself as a bisexual woman, being visibly queer, etc. and just doesn‚Äôt feel as much about gender on its own - it‚Äôs more about her gender + sexuality, where they meet in her expressions. I can‚Äôt say exactly what your joyful gender expressions mean for you, so just adding another anecdote ü•∞', 'I like the term gender expansive. It‚Äôs an umbrella term to describe anyone who does gender in a nonconformist way, anyone who goes beyond the gender binary in any way. So gender expansive includes both trans people and cisgender people who are gender nonconforming (eg cis woman who dresses masculinely while still identifying as a woman).\n\nGender identity is separate but connected to gender expression. (Gender expression = clothes, behaviors, mannerisms that communicate aspects of gender, how we wear gender on our bodies). So it‚Äôs possible for you to feel an internal sense of being a man but enjoy dressing feminine. Feminine men exist, masculine women exist. \n\nIf nonbinary feels right, use it! If another label feels right, use it! It can change on the daily too. No one else can decide what‚Äôs the right way to describe yourself.', 'That\'s why I like genderqueer, because to me it describes the whole spectrum from gender-nonconforming cis people to nonbinary people and anything in between. At first I thought I would sit kind of in the middle, but as time went by I started to feel more and more comfortable with nonbinary as a label as well. I still prefer genderqueer, but use nonbinary outside of the community because it\'s more well-known. There\'s no strict line of ""you must be this queer to be nonbinary"", I\'d say your experiences could definitely fit that label *if you want to claim it* but you don\'t have to. You could just try it out first, if you talk about it with some trusted folks you\'ll probably figure out if you like a label or not. Some people don\'t label themselves at all, some stick to broad umbrella terms, some go deep into microlabels. Any of those is valid if it helps you describe your feelings in a way that feels right to you.', 'You can always try on the label and see how it fits.  i started by asking my partner and close friends to refer to me using they/them pronouns, and i really liked it!  As i‚Äôve continued to transition, i‚Äôve been wondering lately if she/her is more my vibe.  Labels can be helpful for sure, but they are also squiggly things and subject to change.', ""Labels are tools to make the rest of the world understand what your experience is like. Young people make new labels when the old ones don't fit what's in their head. I don't think the label NB existed when you were a teenager or young adult so that's not one you choose, right ?\n\nI don't really know the difference between a gender non conforming cis person and a NB person, but I'm comfortable with someone labeling themselves either.\n\nLabels are good for talking about experiences but are not perfect."", 'Yeah sure, why not?']"
9,DAE binary gender but also believes gender roles are made-up and don‚Äôt define your gender?,"Looking to understand the experiences of others here to add context to my own.

I‚Äôm a cis lady, mid-40s, very certain about being a lady, and equally certain that it‚Äôs not my alignment (or misalignment) with gender norms that settles this. My personality and interests have always been a mix of stereotypically feminine and stereotypically masculine, but I never thought that I WAS a boy, or ought to have BEEN a boy, or would want to fool people into thinking I was a boy‚Ä¶ I just wanted what the boys had. I wanted to not be restricted to ‚Äústuff that is for girls‚Äù by other people.

So I am trying to figure out if genderqueer or GNC is a label I want to use to help explain myself to others, and I see a lot of people who do use those labels saying things like ‚Äúsometimes I feel masc and sometimes I feel femme‚Äù or ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm somewhere in between male and female‚Äù or they‚Äôll describe dressing one way or the other and like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt fully get that. 

I can certainly understand dressing along stereotype lines in order to affect the way you‚Äôre perceived. It also totally makes sense to dress the way you damn well feel like because you like those clothes and stereotypes be damned. Sometimes ya just want to be pretty!

But like‚Ä¶ that all seems to me like presentation, not identity. When you say your internally-felt gender changes, holy crap, what is that LIKE? I always just feel like me. The label ‚Äúwoman‚Äù fits and ‚Äúman‚Äù does not. Having that change seems to me like it would be just‚Ä¶ super unsettling? Like having a different name almost? ‚ÄúYesterday I felt like a Michelle, but today I think I‚Äôm more of a Sylvia.‚Äù (No shade to multiple personality systems, that‚Äôs just not what I want to discuss here.) Non-commital makes a certain kind of sense, but is that more about not feeling the male/female stereotypes don‚Äôt fit you and you don‚Äôt want to be stuck in either box, or is it literally being somewhere else entirely, gender-wise?

HALP, what does genderqueer mean for you? (Yes I‚Äôve read the definitions at gender.wiki but I want to know how the word is actually used and understood in the community.)",11gzqtl,26,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/11gzqtl/dae_binary_gender_but_also_believes_gender_roles/,"['If the label ‚Äúwoman‚Äù always fits and feels comfortable, then yeah, you‚Äôre a woman. \n\nThe unsettling feeling you get when you think of what it would be like to be called ‚Äúman‚Äù is dysphoria. Some people feel that discomfort vary - today being called woman is uncomfortable but maybe next week being called a man is uncomfortable. Maybe neither is comfortable and they‚Äôre most comfortable being considered both or neither. \n\nGenderqueer is a pretty big umbrella. If you feel like you jive with the label as a gender-nonconforming woman, that‚Äôs cool. Maybe you might also want to look into identities like ‚Äúdemi-girl.‚Äù But there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a gender-nonconforming cis woman. \n\nI‚Äôm in this sub cause I identified as genderqueer for a while before coming to terms with the fact that I‚Äôm a somewhat feminine binary trans man. I can be a man but still enjoy ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù things, and the fact that in some ways I am gender-nonconforming doesn‚Äôt make me any less of a man. I‚Äôm a man, because that internal sense of gender that you mentioned, the same thing that makes ‚Äúwoman‚Äù feel comfortable for you and ‚Äúman‚Äù uncomfortable, is the opposite for me. Being considered a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù gives me the same uncomfortable feelings that someone considering you a ‚Äúman‚Äù would. \n\nGender roles can be silly, yes. There‚Äôs no reason I shouldn‚Äôt wear nail polish or makeup if I want to (side note: I personally find the combo of full beard and full face of makeup really hot). But I‚Äôd still be a man wearing polish, liking nail polish doesn‚Äôt make me a woman. I feel very uncomfortable (dysphoria) being feminine in a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù way, but it feels right to me to be feminine sometimes in a ‚Äúman‚Äù way, if that makes sense. If I wear a skirt I want to recognized as a man in a skirt, not seen as a woman just because my bottom clothes don‚Äôt have two separate tubes for my legs. \n\nExternal presentation isn‚Äôt what makes someone trans. It‚Äôs that internal sense of gender being incongruous with their born bodies. I‚Äôve known I was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to have a penis since I was 5. I had a pretty gender neutral childhood, for being in same age range as you. No adults ever told me I could or couldn‚Äôt do something because I was a ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù I grew up learning how to fish, garden, use power tools and build things from wood, how to shoot a gun, as well as how to cook and clean and care for others emotionally. My transness has nothing to do with gender roles, and everything to do with physical and social dysphoria (physical - I don‚Äôt have a penis, puberty gave me huge tits and hips that I‚Äôve always hated, etc. social - that discomfort you mentioned with being seen as the opposite gender).', 'Yeah, gender roles have nothing to do with gender identity. Everything you‚Äôre saying sounds to me pretty typical of a cis woman‚Äôs experience. When you say ‚Äúthe label ‚Äòwoman‚Äô fits and ‚Äòman‚Äô does not‚Äù, that‚Äôs pretty much all you need to know. Given how unnecessarily gendered everything is in our society, it‚Äôs normal to feel that those rules are irrelevant to your life and experience, even if your gender identity aligns with what you were assigned at birth. Many cis people feel that way. (The rigid gender binary harms everyone, including cis people.)\n\nI‚Äôm nonbinary (but not gender fluid). I‚Äôve never felt like the labels ‚Äúwoman‚Äù, ‚Äúman‚Äù, ‚Äúgirl‚Äù, or ‚Äúboy‚Äù felt correct to me. At the end of the day, that‚Äôs how I know I‚Äôm not any of those things, regardless of any affinities I have that may be coded certain ways. Sometimes when trans people talk about their identities they talk about presentation because it‚Äôs easy to understand and for a lot of people presentation is linked to identity, but the bottom line is that your gender identity is ‚ÄúI feel like a _____‚Äù or ‚Äúthe label _____ feels right to me‚Äù; not how you dress or what you like.\n\nThe term ‚Äúgender-nonconforming‚Äù, (but not genderqueer) in my opinion, *can* be used to refer to presentation rather than identity. For example, a butch cis woman who presents very masculine could consider herself gender-nonconforming. Or a cis man who wears makeup regularly could consider himself gender-noncomforming. Because those presentations don‚Äôt ‚Äúconform‚Äù to society‚Äôs rules for their genders. However, you can also see how what is considered ‚Äúconforming‚Äù changes as society‚Äôs rules change. For example, a woman wearing pants in the 1930‚Äôs would have been seen as gender-nonconforming (and possibly arrested for it), but today pretty much all women wear pants, so it‚Äôs not seen that way. A man wearing makeup may one day (hopefully) not be seen as anything unusual. Maybe one day there will be no rules, and nothing will be considered ‚Äúconforming‚Äù or ‚Äúnonconforming‚Äù!\n\nSo, if your presentation doesn‚Äôt conform to the expectations for how women present, then possibly you could claim the label GNC. I would say, though, that in order to claim that label as a cis person, your presentation would have to be different enough from what‚Äôs expected that you risk getting negative feedback from society because of it. A cis woman wearing jeans and a baseball cap isn‚Äôt gender-nonconforming (anymore). \n\nOn the other hand, if all you‚Äôre trying to express is that you are a cis woman that doesn‚Äôt believe that she should be restricted by society‚Äôs gendered rules, then you are just a cool modern woman, and you should continue breaking down gendered barriers for everyone!', 'To me genderqueer means that I don‚Äôt want to be seen by others as a man or a woman, although sometimes I do want to be seen as feminine or masculine, and that changes. I don‚Äôt really feel an internal sense of gender, which I think is common for genderqueer/nonbinary folks and cisgender people. I also think genderqueer describes my experiences in a way because I have had some very ‚Äúgendered‚Äù experiences, like having a kid for example or taking hormones. I do hate feeling like I‚Äôm in a box and I want to do whatever regardless of gender.\n\nI think everyone has a different experience with gender though. Two men might both identify as men, but they may have had very different relationships with ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù and different experiences. They might also have very different physical characteristics.']"
10,Could I be genderqueer if I still like presenting according to my AGAB? Can you help me understand what this would mean?,"TL;DR: Gender questioning pansexual AFAB here.  I'd love to hear from some folks who identify as non-binary but whose presentation matches their AGAB.  Is it possible to be NB and not feel any gender dysphoria or any internal drive to transition?  If so, how do you know that you're NB?  What does the label mean to you?

I've always assumed that I was a women, largely because I grew up with such an expansive, malleable definition of femininity.  However, I have a selection of classically masculine traits and values, like assertiveness, sportiness, protectiveness, and confidence.  I've always been the sort of person to wear a frilly dress one day and purposely androgynous athletic clothes the next day, and both feel like expressions of my identity.  I like my feminine name and using she/her pronouns, but on some days it feels more like ""dressing up"" (in a fun way), rather than a reflection of who I actually am.   When I think about it, the term ""woman"" feel pleasant and safe, but it also feels too narrowly defined (in mainstream society) to describe all of my complexity and contradiction.

All of this has me wondering: what would it mean to think of myself as some flavor of non-binary?  I don't think I want to change my presentation or pronouns, but I imagine it might influence how I see myself and how I interact with my loved ones.  I've also thought about participating in some NB spaces at my university, but I'm worried about taking airtime and support away from folks for whom their NB identities are a bigger part of their lives.

12,Questioning everything I know,"*Mini update at the bottom*

Well this is going to be long but I am losing my mind and need some sort of outside perspective.

I'm 27 AFAB. I have never really had a problem with being called a girl, or using she/her, or any sort of dysphoria regarding my physical appearance. 

But. I'm starting to feel like this might be because of the walls I have built around myself throughout my life to make my life ""easier"". In recent years, I've had friends come out as trans/n-b. And while their personal experiences did not mimic my feelings, something suddenly clicked in my mind and threw me into a void of confusion.

I was the tomboy as a kid, but I still enjoyed dresses every now and then. I enjoyed doing stereotypical boy hobbies as well as painting my nails. As I grew older, I panicked when I thought my voice was ""too low for a girl"", but I distinctly remember feeling a sort of sadness when I hit puberty and starting getting breasts. 

Eventually it subsided, and I presented as extremely feminine. Dresses, makeup, long hair, the like. I enjoyed it. I still do. But it felt almost like a dress-up game. 

I was in a competitive sport for most of my life, where I gained muscle definition. I loved it. My laid-back sitting stance can be characterized as the classic ""sitting like a guy"" pose. I feel euphoric wearing masc clothing, and I feel delicate and pretty in a skirt. 

When I see women with masc characteristics,  I stare. I figured my bisexuality was the cause of that. But recently I've realized it's cause I want to look like them. I don't like thinking I'm a guy, but saying ""woman"" makes me feel weird.

I recently changed my pronouns on socials to she/they. I've always thought I was cis, and now I'm stuck in between who knows what. I've looked at bigender, demigirl, genderfluid...nothing seems right. And while I know I don't necessarily need a label, I'd like to try and explain this to my partner without sounding like a maniac.

I guess, has anyone been through anything remotely similar to what I've been experiencing? Have you found a way to define yourself? I just want to a) stop feeling like I'm a fraud and b) not keep running around in circles.

**Update: well after much pondering and my partner being able to read me way too well, I spoke about everything I was feeling. The more I spoke out loud about it, the more I realized I probably am some sort of fem-leaning NB. She tried to be funny and call me daddy and I immediately recoiled,  so at least I know I'm not into masc type labels haha. 

Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer and share their stories, it helped with organizing my thoughts. My personal suggestion if you're questioning is to talk about it with someone you trust, and talk through as much of the ideas as you can. Having that one-on-one chat really helped me decide what I truly liked/felt comfortable with and what was me being a panic pendulum.

17,So confused about my gender,"Hi all! I've been fighting with myself for years about gender and I just wanted a bit of insight from folks more knowledgeable, and to get my thoughts written down and in the open somewhere. Tl;dr at the bottom.

I'm 28 and AFAB, I've always been gender non-conforming. When I was really young I remember wishing I was a boy, but only because I wouldn't be seen as weird for playing with ""boy"" toys, and wouldn't have to wear a skirt or dress. When I was young my parents didn't mind me playing with gender neutral toys like plastic animals - they never made me play with dolls or anything but also didn't buy me specifically ""boy gendered"" toys. But they've gotten more and more conservative as they've got older and I know that they would be mortified if I told them I was anything but cis-het.

I have always been really uncomfortable being referred to as pretty, or beautiful, or any ""feminine"" leaning compliment. I recently told my boyfriend I would rather be referred to as ""cool"" than anything hahahaa he was alright with that. I also feel weird being referred to as a woman, but I also wouldn't want to be called a man (although that might be because I was bullied very intensely as a teen and they used to call me ""man"" as an insult)

I feel somewhat neutral about they/them, it still doesn't really feel like me. The closest pronouns I've found that I like are she/they, it seems to fit better than any others. I haven't told anybody yet though. I think I feel a deep connection with being female but not at all with being feminine.

20,Advice for accurately portraying genderfluidity?,"I hope this isn't a Rule 2 violation: I want to play a genderfluid character in a  roleplaying game that gets broadcast, and since it's going to be put out to the public I want to try my best to ensure that I'm portraying genderfluidity accurately, rather than than playing a trope.

I've already done a bit of reading of course, but I figured it would be a good idea to ask for advice from members of the community. If there's any genderfluid people who'd be so kind as to share things that you like to see in portrayals of genderfluid or genderqueer characters generally, and especially any pitfalls that I should avoid, then I would really appreciate it. Thanks so much!",11ayn28,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/11ayn28/advice_for_accurately_portraying_genderfluidity/,"['My lived experience (transfeminine genderfluid enby) is that I don\'t feel gender very strongly, but it seems to subtly shift from (usually) more feminine (usually more positive feeling, introverted, feeling like taking up less space, more sassy/silly feeling) to either agender (what even is gender; just sort of existing as a consciousness that doesn\'t want to interact with others, usually), bigender (feeling aspects of both femme and masc at the same time) to more masculine (more competitive, usually a worse mood, rebellious, quick-tempered, wanting to demonstrate strength). \n\nMy perception of my own ""gender affinity"" as I refer to it, can change with mood, weather, or over time (usually between days or after a few hours of interactions with others). There\'s a social chameleon effect where I trend towards the expression of people I\'m socialling with for an extended period of time. If I\'m forced to take control of a situation, I tend to snap into masc pretty quickly though, as there\'s a male privilege of assumed authority, and deeper, stern voices tend to be listened to more than higher, less strict voices. I don\'t like using it and tend to feel dirty afterwards, but it has its time and place... (e.g. Emergency situations or when chairing meetings and needing to exert appropriate authority to get discussions back on track) \n\nMy gender affinity tends to not be perceptible to others much, except for my clothing/accessories. I dress how I feel, and if I can\'t tell how I feel: I guess, then change if I start feeling suspiciously uncomfortable. I sometimes just stare at my wardrobe for a minute or two trying to suss out how I actually feel before even touching anything, because I just REALLY can\'t tell how I feel and don\'t want to cause dysphoria by choosing wrongly ... Default is femme since I feel masc only 10% of the time, with the rest as a mix of femme (50%) or agender/bigender. I get dysphoria more from dressing masc when feeling anything else than dressing femme when masc. \n\nSince I may have a different affinity after I leave the house, there may be a mismatch, and I can end up feeling a general sense of discomfort, but this doesn\'t happen regularly for me. \n\nI normally tend to grow my stubble until it causes me dysphoria; sometimes that can be a single day, sometimes a week.\n\nMy mannerisms tend to shift slightly based on my gender affinity (more closed off as a femme, taking up more space as a masc).\n\nI\'m more soft-spoken and communicate collaboratively when femme, and try to take more control of conversations with a deeper, more authoritative voice when masc; not so much that I interrupt, but I do the male pattern where I semi-interrupt at the usual point to indicate I\'m speaking next; when femme, I sit back and listen until either there\'s a natural lull in conversation, or I\'m directly asked for input.\n\nReally though, aside from regularly looking like a ""dude in a skirt"", most people wouldn\'t know I\'m genderfluid unless I told them directly. They\'d most likely think I\'m either just a trans woman or enby (or just weird) since I\'m expressing as femme through clothing over 90% of the time.  My suggestion for roleplaying as genderfluid would be to subtly mix between being competitive (e.g. Initiating friendly push-up competitions with other guys at the gym) to being a bit more reserved in conversations (active listening and don\'t interrupt). Clothing choice is a wild card. Other than that, just be a person with an individual personality; we\'re not aliens. :)']"
21,I'm feeling very conflicted about my gender identity,"So, here's the rundown. I'm a cis male (18) who happens to have a very feminine face. Chubby cheeks, rosebud lips and an overall round face. I also grow my hair long so that contributes as well. Sometimes I like my face because I feel more feminine at times. But when I feel more masculine, I really don't like my face since it makes me look younger and looks weird in contrast with my tall height and stocky body shape. Sometimes I feel like a some kind of frankenstein's monster with a big, male body and an infants head. 

When I was a closeted child I used to have feelings like, ""if I'm girly but also a boy, that must mean that I have to be a girl"", and, ""if I lived as a girl maybe I'd be happier"". That was me coming to terms with the fact that I'm gay and that I'll never ""be a man"" in the eyes of society. But I've been starting to have those feelings again recently.

I don't identify as trans, but sometimes I feel like I should just live my life as a woman because my face doesn't fit with my body. I get depressed sometimes when I look in the mirror because of the disconnect between my body and my face. I know that losing weight could change how my face looks, but I've had a history of disordered eating and I feel like any attempt at losing weight would turn into an ED. 

I'm feeling really conflicted and confused and I feel like nobody would understand me if I told them about this. I really need advice and support from others because this has negatively affected my self esteem and mental health",11ayi8y,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/11ayi8y/im_feeling_very_conflicted_about_my_gender/,"['No one can dictate your identity, but you can experiment with it.

22,my chosen pronouns now make me dysphoric,"I've been using they/he pronouns among friends and online for a bit now, but it feels so strange when people actually use them for me when they know what I look like. For context, I dress very conventionally feminine, pink, dresses, long hair, etc, and 100% of the time I am perceived by at the very least strangers to be a girl. I think there's just some level of internalized transphobia where I feel like people are just humoring me when they use he/him for me, like they probably just think I'm a girl and are just playing along. 

While I love he/him and to a lesser extent they/them pronouns, it almost makes me dysphoric when people use them because I feel like they're somehow teasing me. Also, when I refer to myself in the third person I usually use she/her because I feel sort of embarrassed about not liking it even when I'm talking to people who know what pronouns I prefer. Essentially, all pronouns make me dysphoric and sometimes my name does too, and the name I really like is now associated in my head with someone I've gotten to know, so it feels like it's not mine anymore. 

I really don't know what to do about all this, I just feel like a fraud because my gender expression and my gender don't match up and that my pronouns aren't what people would expect when looking at me. Does anyone have any advice or words of wisdom about how to get over myself about this?",119ovcf,70,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/119ovcf/my_chosen_pronouns_now_make_me_dysphoric/,"['I don‚Äôt have much advice on how to get over it, but I know how you‚Äôre feeling.

The rest of the time it\'s ""they"". For me ""they"" feels fine (not great, but fine) even if I think people are forcing it.

(Besides undertake a deep personal project that involves unpacking and reassessing deep-seated and fundamental things about how they process and navigate their social environment... which they probably should but there\'s only so far that I can make that my business for strangers.)\n\nThe fact that a ""they"" feels forced is something I have an easier time slotting into ""their problem"" rather than ""my problem"", compared to ""she"".\n\nI guess in my case that\'s a reflection of how I use pronouns to navigate my social environment today.

However, I find that when I practice using the correct pronouns and gendered nouns for someone, even if their appearance is different than I might subconsciously expect that person to be, my experience of them changes. Being exposed to more people whose presentations don\'t match cis standards was incredibly helpful for me when i was first figuring out my gender stuff. I could feel the difference for myself between ""just humoring someone"" and when the pronouns really ""sunk in"". \n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to consider the differences between feeling embarrassed to have gender related needs and gender related dysphoria, because right now it sounds like they are very similar experiences for you. Practice writing about yourself in third person with different pronouns. Describe yourself, talk about what you like and dislike, write a little biography. When there is no one else around to see it, what feels better? \n\nPersonally, I will *accept* any pronouns and almost never correct people. However, my pronouns are they/them. Distinguishing between what I can accept from others and what is actually *me* helps me a lot to deal with misgendering. \n\nIt can also be helpful to remember that it isn\'t just gender that people make incorrect assumptions about based on appearance. For example, many people have experienced being assumed to be younger or older than they actually are. Someone else\'s belief based on your appearance does not change your actual age and it doesn\'t change your gender either.', ""I've been forced to accept they/them because people are trying to be more enby inclusive/gender neutral, but it gives me mad dysphoria because my chosen pronouns are she/her and he/him.

27,"I don't get gender, I think?","I'm a cis man, but seemingly not in the way my cis guy friends seem to be?

For context, I've always had almost waist length hair since I was a child (mostly because I didn't care and my mom forgot to make an appointment to the hairdressers very oftenüíÄ) and I have been misgendered because of that for basically my whole life.
People would think that I was a trans child and got angry at my mom when she would say I was a boy. ""Because that's clearly a little girl""

I always had mainly girl friends and never hung out with a group of only boys (I still haven't it lmfao). So I often got grouped in with the girls in greetings and general statements.
When I would correct them, they'd say that I don't really count.

There is a great deal of gender diversity, even outside of the transgender community.\n\nCase in point: You can be a ""man"" that conceptualizes your gender very differently than another ""man"", even though you both accept your sex assigned at birth. However, the category of ""cisgender"" completely erases these important distinctions, and gives the illusion that all AMAB men are one in the same, despite having uniquely gendered experiences.\n\nWhat\'s even more interesting is how many non-Western cultures already recognize such distinctions by classifying gender-atypical males as a third-gender category:\n\n* Two-spirit (Native Americans)\n* Muxe (Mexico)\n* Kathoey (Thailand)\n* Ashtime (Ethiopia)\n* Maori (New Zealand)\n* Femminiello (Italy)\n* Travesti (Latin America)\n\nIt should be noted that this third-gender category isn\'t the same as what we call nonbinary or transgender, because in these cultures ""gender"" is related moreso to societal norms and expectations. So for the most part, they are not in denial of being male but rather embracing and celebrating the fact they are a different type of male.\n\nThis of course is very different than how gender works in the Western world, where gender-atypical males are qualified as ""cisgender"" right alongside their gender-typical peers.']"

I have tried to educate him and he has become more understanding of queer people and gender being something that people choose for themselves and we should just respect people's pronouns. 

However because we have had these conversations I am scared he will be confused and start asking a whole bunch of questions and start debating with me when I come out to him instead of being supportive and just say ""thank you for telling me, I still love you regardless of what pronoun you want to use.""

34,Curious about my gender identity,"Hey friends! I‚Äôm AFAB and have been on a kinda ‚Äúgender‚Äù journey for the last‚Ä¶ 3 years?, finding out who I am and experimenting and I‚Äôve found this year is probably the most comfortable I‚Äôve felt in my gender expression and identity, however I don‚Äôt really know how to describe it. I‚Äôve realized I enjoy being hyper feminine, I love feminine compliments and go by almost exclusively she/her pronouns but I don‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äúcis‚Äù woman even though that‚Äôs my biological gender. I think the best way to describe it is I feel like a drag queen almost haha, like people perceive me as a woman and I enjoy performing as one but I don‚Äôt feel like one.

35,"I need help finding books, and maybe advice on being a better big sister","Hello! For context, I have a younger sibling that is questioning their gender pretty heavily. They just turned 13. They used to go by she/her, but now juggle between he/him and they/them pronouns. I am very aware that they want to be nonbinary, but they firmly believe that you can only be a boy or a girl. It's frustrating for them, knowing they don't fit in either box but somehow feel they have to.This is only made worse with their autism, they feel so uncomfortable in their own body somedays.  Me and my mother continuously drop hints that you can be in between if you want, since my sibling does not react well to direct and blunt communication. I'm not sure it's working though.

I'm dying over here. I just went away to college,  in state but hours away. My sibling, because of their autism, is very uncomfortable with communication. They will text and call me, but are not on their phone often at all. That's not a problem to me, I just feel like I have no way to help since I can't physically communicate with them through hugs and such. I want to be there, I want my support to be obvious and to be a safe haven for them. For more context, I used to be an awful sister. Even though I've been much better for years I can't imagine the trauma I caused my little sibling. It haunts me everyday. I understand to some point how they feel, I was born with Borderline Personality Disorder and have had psychical and emotional identity issues my entire life so far. Especially in middle school. And yet I'm so deeply aware of how little I know about what my little gem is going through. I'm cis-gendered. Having lots of gender queer friends throughout my life and my own identity issues only helps me understand to a certain point.

One thing is my sibling likes secret gifts, specifically books. They read faster than anyone I know. So I've come up with a plan to send my little sibling a book a month from college, but I only have four books so far. I'll list them below to make sure y'all approve, given I have no idea what will be helpful or not for my sibling as I've never experienced this. 

I'd  like to ask if y'all have any good book recommendations, especially graphic novels. I'd prefer it if they were realistic but kinda light hearted, showing there will be a day where they will be comfortable in their own identity. I'd rather if they read more darker pieces, they do so on their own terms. My sibling also leans asexual, so I'm trying to keep them more based on gender identity than sexuality. They are pretty comfortable in their sexuality.

Thank you!!!

Here's the four books I have saved so far:
- Tomboy by Liz Prince
- Symptoms of Being Human by Jeff Garvin (I'm not sure if it's too dark or not, it triggers me but we have different triggers so I feel unfit to determine if it's too dark)

40,"Trying to find the right label for myself, wondering if genderqueer is it","EDIT:  After using the [Gender Wiki](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_Wiki) and looking through the less common labels there, I've finally found one that fits me!! Paragirlflux = paragirl (mostly but not entirely fem, the rest is neutral/agender) + girlflux (amount of feeling of fem fluctuates). It feels silly to identify with a microlabel but it really is exactly how I feel omg

Ultimately it still falls under the genderfluid umbrella but I think I may use genderqueer sometimes too when genderfluid feels weird since I never use the masc/full nonbinary parts of the spectrum.

\---

Hey everyone! I've been doing some soul searching lately, and I know I'm not fully cisgender anymore. However...I'm really struggling to find a label that feels comfortable for myself. I know I don't ""need"" one but having something I can fall back on internally will help me a lot I think.

Basically, I always feel fem. Sometimes I feel very femgirl, sometimes just kind of a fem neutral (kind of like ""I am a person who happens to be a woman""), sometimes very much just a person, full neutral, and I get surprised when someone does something referencing my existence in a fem body....but even on those full neutral moments I still never want to be seen as masc. It's like, if my gender was a dog on a lead in a backyard, and the point where the lead is attached to the house is at 100% Pure Fem. everywhere else that the dog can run is my fluctuations between agender, neutral, and various degrees of fem. And, of course, since it's metaphorically on a leash, the gender dog never runs into the masc zones.

I know there's various sub types of genderfluxes and genderfluids but none of them feel quite right. Genderfluid feels the best so far but it's still not right. It's like wearing shoes that are too big. It's technically functional but not the right size. And I'm not sure about using nonbinary. It could fit but something about it doesn't feel right right now.

Would it make sense to try genderqueer, even though I mainly present in ways that are visually consistent with my AGAB? Every time I try to google genderqueer stuff it's all results about how genderqueer is a political gender and focuses on ""queering your gender expression"" and etc, and very little about how it actually feels to be different types of genderqueer.",112bpez,28,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/112bpez/trying_to_find_the_right_label_for_myself/,"['Absolutely you can use genderqueer! However, I would also say that there\'s a reason you\'re getting those results, and that it\'s largely down to the fact that genderqueer doesn\'t really sit only in the box of ""gender identity."" It\'s also a word many people use to describe their relationship with gender, be it identity, roles, expression, and so on. Cisgender people have always historically had access to the term, for example, in addition to trans people and those who refuse the cis/trans binary. It functionally just means your relationship to your gender is a queer relationship--what that looks like is going to be different for everyone.\n\nI personally use it as my gender identity label, because I am deeply fond of its history, its flexibility, and the fact that it is vague enough to mean many different things but always solidly indicates that my gender isn\'t going to line up with binary expectations. I don\'t like the term ""nonbinary"" for an identity (thought I accept that politically, I am thusly aligned) because to me, it reinforces the binary and suggests (or feels like it suggests) that I mustn\'t identify *whatsoever* with either binary gender (or otherwise situate myself fallaciously ""between"" the two). I\'ve used genderfae before (don\'t know if you\'ve come across that one, but if not I\'d recommend looking into it based on your description) but eventually decided it wasn\'t really *quite* accurate for me, and I didn\'t want to always be explaining its meaning and my relation to it.\n\nHope this helps!

51,Binders and breast damage,"Hello everybody! I've been lurking here for a while, and this is my first post.

I recently got my first binder but heard that it will cause boob damage (like saggier and stuff). How true/severe is this? Because I'm not a trans man. I'm more in the agender/non-gender conforming section of things. Like, I couldn't give less of a shit about what pronouns are used for me. When people ask my pronouns I just tell them that I'm indifferent with no preference. And, well, I don't hate my boobs every day. Just most days. Also, I get a bit upset when my female figure is visible in certain clothing/outfits. I just want to be androgynous seeming on most days. But on occasions (a couple of times per year) when I put on a dress and earrings to go to a fancy event, I feel comfortable with myself. So like I'm not completely detached from my femininity? 

That sounded weird.

 Anyways, away from my mixed-up gender identity. I'm C cup. Does anybody know how much this would damage my breasts? And other side effects that yall afabs have experienced.

52,"The complicatedness of not being binary is frustrating (not wanting breasts for AMAB): questioning for 2 yrs., and stuck.","I'm AMAB and 26 and am about to come up on 2 years since I officially mark the start of when I was gender questioning---by when I recognizably felt dysphoria and the desire to transition, although clearly it's been much longer (actually starting to try to figure out my gender issues a year earlier than that, in response to recognizing my lifelong gender issues since I was 4 and screamed at the top of my lungs on the preschool yard that I wanted to be a girl and specifically wear a red dress.) 2 years later, which went by in a breeze, and I still haven't made much progress.

At least perhaps I can tell what I'm (probably) not, and that is a binary trans woman, and unfortunately it feels frustrating that I land in nonbinary land since it feels limiting what I'd be able to do with HRT:

\-I can't *really* identify as 'woman', while at the same time the word 'man' doesn't fit either ('boy' perhaps.)

\-It often feels difficult to imagine myself being called by anything other than my birth name, even the feminine form of it. I'll call myself here 'Andonis' vs. 'Andonia': 'Andonis' still feels more natural.

\-I hate my body hair, and masculinizing features like skin, hair loss, prefer female fat distribution, *but...*

\-Knowing that HRT effects can't be picked and chosen...

\-I go back and forth everyday about whether or not I want breasts, and I lean towards not wanting them. Although this sounds really creepy, I honestly go onto [r/transbreasttimelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/transbreasttimelines/) trying to figure out, do I want that on my chest? The fact that I have to question it, that nothing feels missing on my chest, strongly suggests that if I go on HRT, I'll get distressed by breasts. I don't like the idea of getting top surgery after HRT just for that.

\-I don't get any younger, and although I know I still have a lot of time ahead of me, it feels like I'm running out of time. I'm afraid of masculinizing further, only figuring things out and needing to transition say at 40.

\-Although I'm exhausted of trying to find the right labels, so don't worry about it too much---I'm confident in at least the broadest descriptors: genderqueer, NB, trans in the widest generic sense---genderfluid is how I wish I could be...but I get frustrated with the reality that actual genderfluidity isn't possible: I can't just magically transform from girl to boy/woman to man whenever I want.

Unfortunately, I almost feel jealous of binary trans women for being binary and knowing precisely who they are, and for wanting breasts thus being able to have the full effects of HRT changing their biology. I know that internal identity is more important than being on HRT or not, but for them it just feels more *real* and bodily. They can actually get naturally smooth skin, start to lose body hair, less body odor, face changes, fat redistribution, changes to experiencing sexuality, but for me just because I'm iffy about breasts I won't get any 'real' changes and just continue to age and masculinize.

Well to conclude, maybe this didn't make sense so I guess it was more of a rant. But in terms of concrete support, I would really be interested in how to approach this problem of not wanting masculinization but not necessarily wanting breasts. Is anyone else this way? How do you go about it? Is HRT possible without breast development, e.g. microdosing intermittently and going on and off.",10ulxu7,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10ulxu7/the_complicatedness_of_not_being_binary_is/,"[""I'm 72 now and at age 4 I put on my sister's panties as they seemed to be the right ones for me.

I then stopped wanting others to validate me as a woman and a zillion problems went away.

53,Hips getting wider and I hate it [VENT],"\[ TW - Dysphoria and internalized transphobia \]

Oh god.  I'm trying not to freak out. At first I thought I was just imagining it but now I can't deny it.  My hips are getting wider.  It's making me very dysphoric.

On top of that, my time of the month is here in full swing.

I know that I'm trans.  I've been repressing and trying to ""just work with with what I have / be happy with what I have"" ever since puberty.  Am 23 now.

Don't know if I'll ever go on T.  I'm scared.  I don't want to be ostracized, but I'm already an outcast and it fucking sucks.  It's lonely but at least being perceived as female tends to make people somewhat  friendly to me.  After reading about other people's experiences I've gathered that people are cold towards you when you're being perceived as male.

So the way I see it by transitioning I'd no longer have the same community with women, and I wouldn't fit in with men either.

This is the thought process that has caused me to suppress for this long.

It's true that on average men are less affectionate with each other, less likely to talk about their feelings, and all that stuff. And it can feel alienating to someone who previously experienced social interactions as a woman. Interactions with women also change because they  will no longer feel that immediate solidarity and safety with you if they perceive you as a man. \n\nBUT these things are not the end of the world. First of all, all of my closest friends from before transition are my closest friends after transition, and they are all women. We knew each other on a level that went deeper than gender stereotypes, so transition didn't change anything. \n\nSocial interactions with new people have required some adjustment. I've learned to understand that I need to act a bit differently than I used to around women I don't know very well. I don't want them to feel unsafe, or talked over, and I understand why because I've been there. That doesn't mean you can't get close to women, it's just a different process and you have to be a little bit patient and let them scope you out as a potential friend (i.e. not a creep). Socializing with men is a little trickier for me because I have few stereotypically masculine hobbies, so we have less in common. But I just try to be myself and there are men who appreciate that and want to get to know me better. \n\nI do have a community though, with other queer and trans people. There are fewer of us, so you have to go out of your way a bit more to find that community. But it's totally worth it. Also, remember that people make posts about this stuff mainly to vent when they're feeling frustrated. You only hear about the worst experiences, and you rarely hear about the positives. Personally I find it relieving to not be lumped in with women in social situations anymore, even though it does entail some loss socially, because it just never felt right in the first place. And in some ways that has made it easier for me to be social and open up to people, because I'm not constantly feeling like an imposter.\n\nSorry, this got a bit longer than I intended, the tl;dr is that yes, socializing is different when you are perceived as a man, but it's hard to imagine what that really means until you experience it, and it's not as bad as you probably think it is. If transition is something you want, I personally don't think this is a good reason to hold yourself back."", 'I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through that. Watching your body change in a way you don‚Äôt like is awful and I can sympathize with that. I‚Äôm not sure if I can give any advice but I just want to say if you do go ahead and transition you‚Äôll always be part of the trans community and the wider LGBTQ+ community.

56,'Tomboy': to use or not to use?,"Hi guys! I'm in my final year at uni currently writing my dissertation on gender theory in contemporary genre fiction.

Do you think it's harmful because it compares girls to boys/hypergenders children and puts them into one more category when gender and sex exist as a spectrum anyway/celebrates traditional masculinity more than traditional femininity, or do you think it's still a valid term to use to help young girls explore their gender identities?

If an AFAB doesn\'t identify as a girl, then ""tomboy"" isn\'t really an appropriate description unless they use it do describe themself.

I& ID as transmasc genderfluid now and as a child tomboy was a useful term.

Even when I was using it, tomboy was not entirely accurate, but I had no alternatives. To another person it may still be accurate and useful.\n\nI admit I\'m not sure what you mean by ""hypergenders children"" or why that would be an issue. I guess I wouldn\'t want someone to be labeled a tomboy without their consent, but that applies to all labels. Hell, I remember being told by other kids that I couldn\'t be a tomboy because I wore dresses sometimes, and that was really invalidating. Though ""tomboy"" is about presentation, ime it\'s ultimately still an identity label and can be very important to people of any age.', 'I started to write that it was fine because cis women can be tomboys.  But the more I thought about it, I think it should be avoided.  Basically, tomboy is roughly synonymous with the phrase ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù because if it was the same, then why would you need a separate word?  So in defining a tomboy, you are essentially saying what a girl is and isn‚Äôt, which upholds traditional gender roles while also creating a binary within the category of female that can be hard for young girls to break down.  \n\nAlso, in my experience, tomboy is often used to invalidate trans men/masc people.  There was someone I went to school with through 8th grade who is most likely a trans man.  To be fair, I never heard him say that, but I also recognize that in that part of my life those words wouldn‚Äôt have meant anything and that we went to a Christian school so he might not have been allowed to say it.

Anyway, he made it very clear over the years that he would rather be a boy than a girl, but the adults would say ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs just a tomboy‚Äù which not only enforced his gender assigned at birth but also carried the connotations that he would grown out of it.\n\nI mean, I‚Äôm not going to tell someone they can‚Äôt call themselves a tomboy if they feel the most comfortable with it, but I very strongly feel that we shouldn‚Äôt label other people as tomboys and I‚Äôd be happy to see the word die out altogether.', ""Tomboy is a perfectly fine term but for myself personally it feels really Soft and Socially Acceptable to me.

At the moment, it felt encouraging knowing they'll be here, but now I have a lot of anxiety and I feel like I won't have anything to share with the others at the group, I'm nervous that my friends might think I don't fit, I feel illegitimate to go.  


I think I just need to share this feeling with someone but I don't feel confortable sharing it to a friend, so I'm just dropping it there...

58,"Am I genderqueer/something else, or just a cis girl who happens to like traditionally masculine stuff sometimes?","I wasn't sure where to post this honestly, I considered /r/nonbinary and /r/demigirl but neither felt appropriate.

I've always thought I was cis, and maybe I still am, but I started to question my gender after finding out that it was ""allowed"" to be explored. I've been going as she/they for a little bit now, and it feels fitting.

I've always always felt comfortable being called a woman, presenting as a woman, and being seen as a woman. I even love hyperfeminine presentation. I love makeup, I love long nails, giant lashes, super long hair, girly clothing. I wouldn't give it up. But there are times where I'm interested in male/masculine presentation and dress as so, or even being seen as someone masculine. In high school, I cut my hair very short and dressed masculine for maybe like 2 years. I called myself a tomboy. I tried to study how men walked and copied that, I even lowered my voice on purpose. I would relate to characters like Mulan or Olivia from She's the Man. I sometimes wore makeup in a way to masculinize my face as best as I could. I felt comfortable in it, but eventually went back to presenting feminine and have been doing so. I wouldn't mind if someone even mistook me as a man, but I would feel uncomfortable if someone called me he/him.

I've roleplayed many male characters for DnD and felt pretty comfortable in it, and enjoyed writing for them. One of my DnD characters I sort of use as an outlet for my masculine side, and like most self written characters, feels like an ""aspect"" of me.

Thing is, nonbinary, demigirl, genderfluid, genderflux, etc. a lot of those don't feel like labels that fit me. This is especially because I feel very comfortable being considered a woman, so I always thought that that 'wanting to be a guy sometimes' thing was a phase. But it's been like that since I was a teen, and now I'm an adult which is why I'm asking. So maybe I'm cis girl who's into traditionally masculine stuff sometimes? Maybe it's linked to my sexuality (I'm bisexual)? Idk how though. 

Do other cis people feel this sometimes too?

I figured I'd ask here for a second opinion. I only recently started exploring my gender.

59,Advice on how to do body streams on Twitch as a genderqueer AMAB person?,"I want to be able to do body streams on Twitch just like women are able to do. But there's a problem.

Twitch's policies are heavily biased in favour of content that appeals to straight men. Twitch is a video gaming platform so it should come as no surprise, their primary market is straight men. This of course gives extreme latitude for women to celebrate their bodies in highly ""compromising"" ways, all the while never fearing enforcement action because they are helping to promote a heteronormative ideal which is ""good business"" for Twitch.

Meanwhile Twitch unfairly penalizes AMAB trans and queer folks for doing body streams because that threatens their patriarchal business model. Consider trans streamer Anne Atomic who was banned for wearing a bikini in a hot tub -- exactly like cisgender women do on Twitch:

[Trans streamer shares the vile abuse she's received ‚Äì¬†but Twitch have banned her, not her trolls](https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/07/09/twitch-trans-streamer-anne-atomic/)

She was mass reported by transphobic trolls, and never given an apology nor an explanation. I too have faced similar consequences-- even when I was fully clothed. That's right, I had no exposed skin other than my hands and face. But much like Anne Atomic, within minutes of a troll coming into my chatroom hurling homophobic slurs at me, I was banned for ""inappropriate attire"".

And now for the real kicker.

Only one week after my first ban was lifted, I was watching a live town hall meeting on the official Twitch channel. Right in the middle of that broadcast, an ad came on for Hane's men's pouch briefs -- depicting a husky cisgender man reclining in a hammock with his shirt unbuttoned and open, fully revealing his abs and hairy chest. Of course, you could also see his underwear, showcasing the clear outline of his male genitals in the skintight briefs. 

It's so discouraging that a platform which bills itself as being LGBTQ inclusive, with its pride emotes and LGBTQ tags, goes out of their way to protect the delicate sensibilities of homophobes at every turn. Is it really that wrong for queer and trans streamers to want the same freedoms as cisgender women to celebrate body positivity? Am I missing something?",10rz8li,64,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10rz8li/advice_on_how_to_do_body_streams_on_twitch_as_a/,"['One thing you will want to do right off the bat is to build your audience in a way that doesn‚Äôt rely on twitch.

60,How to understand identity without definitions?,"I'm still a bit confused, and I feel like other people are here feeling this way as well. I'm feeling like I'm non-binary, but I could also be a multitude of other things: polygender, genderfluid, etc.

I'm trying to work out the logic in this system and it's leading me to a weird impasse: what are the definitions of man and woman? I feel like, in order to say that I don't fit into a category, I need to know the bounds of that category. 

I also understand that this is all a nebulous construction of human societies around the world in an attempt to simplify and organize people based on similarities. That being said, gender as an idea is inherently malleable. How can I find where I fit if the boundaries are everchanging? How can I understand if everyone has a different perspective?

If I tell someone I'm male, but what I mean is ""person that likes art and cooking and loves to nuture life, is mentally and physical strong, loves to crochet, and enjoys playing first-person shooters"" and they think I mean ""person that likes football and has a penis,"" we're at a cosmic misunderstanding of eachother. This disconnect shows the blurred area of what ""male"" even is...

I just want to know where I belong and what to tell people that ask. I want to show up at pride being my most authentic self. I don't want the LGBTQIA+ community to see me as a straight cis- man coopting their celebration as an attempt to make myself feel better for being an ally - because in reality, I feel more at peace with people at pride than I ever have with a bunch of straight white men. 

It's made clear that I'm never enough of a man for the cisgendered group, but I'm also too much of a man at pride.

While likes and interests can be stereotyped to specific genders in some cases, likes and interest don‚Äôt really belong to a gender, and so it may help you to think about your personality and the things that bring you joy in the terms of your personality, and the things that you bring you joy rather than, how you compare to the average social structures of men and women.   \n\nI apologize for any grammar issues, I‚Äôm using text to speech.', 'Hi there!

61,The polar opposite gender roles we're sold are not natural,"This goes for cis people too. Males and females are not opposites. They're members of the same species with slightly different traits/identities. There's nothing healthy about making gender define every aspect of everyone's life, personality and activities. Of restricting what people can do and who they can be based on a few body parts or the gender marker on their drivers license.

I don't always know how much I'm trans and how much I'm just at war with the role of gender in American society today. I want to be a person first and foremost, to have my own personality as a person not a gender, and to do things that people do regardless of how they're gendered. That should be available to everyone.

I see gender as something more incidental. Like if I have a gender, it's no more important than my height or the shape of my nose. It's just a random thing that exists.

I feel like my non-binary gender is partly a form of protest against society's oppressive gender rules. The way we're constantly stereotyped and told what to do and what we can't do. I don't want to be in either category. I want the full human experience. We only get to live for so long. Why not experience it all?

I'm not a native speaker and I don't speak english very often...

ok, most of the time I feel ok with being a girl and I don't think too much about it, but last year I've had an identity crises and it was kinda hard for me... I got uncomfortable with performing femininity too and I was confused and sad.
after that, i don't know how or why (probably bc my mechanism of defense is forgetting/repression idk)

I  think this identity crises of mine was in August/September and being more.. neutral? or maybe less feminine? I really don't know how to put into words but I'll just give an example:

i used to wear skinny jeans and feel ok with it or just indifferent, but I've started too use a larger type of jeans to go to school and I know that clothes there's nothing to do with gender but it's just the way I've felt!! 

after that, i don't know how or why (probably bc my mechanism of defense is forgetting/repression idk) I've started feeling ok with ""being a woman/girl"" again and stuff. I've had my graduation and now I'm preparing to go to college and this week I've started feeling not ok with being feminine and it was so sudden... 

I've felt very confuse, and I was searching about gender compulsively (like I'm doing until now) and I didn't found an answer.

I have a job, and on it I have to be feminine and delicate bc I work with my mom in a school and there's a whole social thing about it (at least on my head)

Today I'm feeling more ok with ""being a girl"" but what is really be a girl? What is that?

63,"Questioning my gender (long post, don't read if you care about your eye health lmao)","Sooooo, I don't really know what's going on with my gender. I started questioning it about three years ago. I've chilled out with finding a label for the most part bc I've identified with so many that I kinda just settled on being trans. A couple years ago I started being really active online and found a safe community to be myself and experiement with pronouns and names. I'm a minor and homeschooled, so my social life is basically nonexistent irl, but that's another issue. I think what I need to do is come out irl and make friends who are supportive bc there's only so many ways i can experiment online. It will probably take me at least a couple years to get to get the point where i can express myself and it would probably be good for me to see a gender therapist at some point. I'm not looking for advice on how to meet people irl or express myself more- thats just not an option for me, right now. I want to ramble and see if yall have any insight or if anyone else can relate yk. 

Anyway, idk how to describe this, but it's like I'm female at my core and a boy on the outer shell? Im afab btw. I'm neutral with periods, makeup, boobs and she/her pronouns and whatever, but I feel like I just look wrong on the outside? Like I should be more masculine and muscular (not saying being muscular is a masc thing- just that it would be easier for me be muscular if i was amab), and have a deeper voice. I want people to percieve me as a boy, however being afab doesn't feel Wrong to me, either. Being afab is part of me. Even if I medically transitioned and got all the surgeries there would still be parts of me physically that are female...  and that doesn't bother me? I feel like my gender is like those caramel chocolates and being afab is the caramel and whatever being masculine is supposed to be is the chocolate? Ik that labels and gender are complicated. Most people dont check all the boxes to fit labels. We use labels to describe who we are and give us the language to exist and connect with other people. I've never heard anyone talk about gender the way I feel about it. Maybe it's bc there isn't a label for me or gender is a social construct and masculinity and feminity is arguably a social contruct too... idk. I dont feel like my gender is fluid, but it definitely doesnt fit into the ""binary"". Maybe I'm cis and just figuring shit out bc I'm young. I like having a traditionally masc name online and stuff. I dont have too much physical dysphoria. Like if i medically transition I'll probably go on testosterone and get a hysterectomy bc fuck periods, but otherwise idc.

I was drinking, and then eating garbage. And then waking up the next day *feeling* like garbage, looking like garbage. I\'d worked long and hard to get down to 150lbs. at 6\', and drinking alcohol and eating the Standard American Diet were sabotaging *all* of that.\n\nLike a lightswitch, done. I decided, ok quit drinking. From 30 beers a night to none, done. Ok, go vegan. I\'d started in on vegetarianism in high school in the 90s, drifted away due to life circumstances and then flitted back and forth with a vegetarian diet and then later, a pescetarian diet. It wasn\'t a big change, a gradual one, over time.\n\nI\'d started in the mainstream vegan subreddits, but found them so full of toxicity and backbiting and hand wringing over somebody eating the same diet for different reasons, be it moral or health or whatever. I don\'t want to see pictures of killing floors and hear about the carnivores, I want to talk about the things that bring me joy, the beans and quinoa and veggies, the salsa and banana bread and apple spice cake! As a result, I stumbled my way into /r/PlantBasedDiet, not quite knowing what it actually was. I subscribed, and through sheer cultural osmosis, I slowly picked up on the tenets through reading the posts and comments on my home page. Wait no salt, *what?* Why? Oh... you know that actually makes a lot of sense. No sugar? No *oil?!* After slowly digesting the science behind it all, courtesy of [Dr. Greger](https://www.youtube.com/@NutritionFactsOrg) and [The Daily Dozen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqmSMunAtss) (there\'s an app for that!) and [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org), and I was *sold.*\n\nNo added salt, no added sugar, no oil, no meat, no dairy, minimally processed. Flour is *super* processed, you\'ve broken down all those cell walls. A carrot, chewed with your mouth, is minimally processed. This is where I meant at the first paragraph, with it being more complicated than calorie math - it also has to do with how accessible the calories *are* for your body, and how many can be extracted during the time it\'s in your body.\n\nThat being said, when I quit drinking and started on the WFPB vegan train I dropped weight like a *stone.* I had to learn to eat more than I physically felt comfortable eating, because so much of whole food plants is sheer *fiber.* In 2 months time I\'d shed that pooch, I know what you\'re talking about, I had it too. And it just disappeared and suddenly I had *abs*, what in the fuck? I remember looking in the bathroom mirror just fucking dumbfounded. That\'s my aesthetic since going WFPB, ottermode, abs and hip v, lithe and lean.\n\nThat\'s the idea though, ""wall off your calories."" Picture a stalk of celery. Picture yourself chewing it up, swallowing. How broken down were the cell walls, how many of them were left intact, to be worked on by your gut flora? Now take that same stalk and instead, run it through a food processor on puree. Those cell walls are *ruptured*, are wide open and the delicious caloric load within is readily available for absorption.\n\nI eat beans, 2-4 cups of black and pinto beans, 1:1 ratio with cumin garlic powder paprika chili powder and onion powder.

Just stopped. Started keeping a gallon of water next to me at all times. Got to drinking 1/2 to 1 full gallon of water a day.

65,Questioning my gender and need help with where to start...not sure if it's gender dysphoria or something else?,"I was born a woman, and have identified as one for my entire life, but over the past six months, I've been questioning my gender. I feel like a fraud though, and I was wondering if someone could help me decipher how much of my feelings are genuine indicators of being gender-queer versus being:

1. body dysmorphia / body image issues
2. dissociative episodes (i've experienced this before but only really became aware of what was happening about a year ago)
3. trauma-response connected to past experiences with my body (i was sexually assaulted a few months before these feelings started intensifying)

I'll explain: On most days, I feel like a woman, but then, suddenly, a few days or a week will come around and I feel really disassociated from my body. Like I'm not really there. I'm just a just a soul in this human vessel that just happens to look like a girl. I feel trapped in my body and wish I could just disappear, hide or hurt parts of myself. I feel like a stranger to myself, and I don't want to be perceived by anyone. These moments are also accompanied with extreme depressive thoughts, crying, etc.

Yesterday was the first time I thought about these feelings in the context of gender. When I felt this way, I dressed in super baggy clothes that hid my figure and tried calling myself different pronouns like he/him and they/them in the mirror. I felt this sense of freedom and calm walking around not feeling like I was being perceived as a woman. It was one of the first times I didn't feel this insane anxiety going to a concert with friends. The dissociative episode went away after doing that, and even today, I feel a lot better too. It's probably the fastest I've ever been able to end one of these episodes.

What's confusing me though is a few days before I dressed up super girly though and felt like a total bad bitch and had no dysphoria about it at all. A lot of times I feel this way - happy and pretty as a woman - and eager to dress up like one.

At the same time, there are a lot of days where the idea of being a woman riddles me with anxiety because of how people have to perceive me as a result. I feel this pressure to dress super feminine, or hypersexualize myself, to have a certain ""girly"" personality, in order to be accepted and treated well, especially by men. It's like I'm putting on a costume. It has brought me to tears before a night out with friends. 

Sometimes I find myself craving those long periods of time when I see no one for a few days and I'm free to look however I want without anyone perceiving me. I can just sink into the nothingness. I realized recently that when I spend long periods of time by myself I feel genderless. But then I leave my house, and I am perceived, and I am reminded that I am a woman.

These feelings I've been having lately have opened a Pandora's box tbh. I keep thinking about all these other times from my past when I felt hyper-sensitive of my body or gender expression but didn't have the words for it. Some examples:

\- Refusing to play with ""girly"" toys to the point of throwing temper tantrums (I loved pink though lol)

\-Avoiding certain sports, games, or clothes that put my body on display

\-Hiding my curves in clothes and refusing to wear dresses/skirts to school until college because I didn't want people to look at me

\-Very restrictive eating patterns in teenage years

\-A 5th grade journal entry casually talking about how ""sometimes I wish I was a boy but not always""

\-Gravitating towards hanging with boys during recess until middle school

I honestly kind of suppressed these memories until recently because my therapist has been having me do a lot of trauma work around my body since getting sexually assaulted. But I can't seem to avoid the feelings, and I wanted to know what your thoughts are: Do you think I could be gender-queer or is this something else? If so, what labels might fit me? Are there any resources that you'd recommend me starting with to help with my exploration of my identity?",10pncm3,20,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10pncm3/questioning_my_gender_and_need_help_with_where_to/,"['[Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)\n\nGenderqueer, genderfluid?', ""These feelings can be tough to sort out.  \n\nTry to imagine a world where there is no sexual assault, there is no sexism or patriarchy or transphobia.

People are free to choose their pronouns and free to transform their bodies to what feels the most comfortable and euphoric to them.

An exceptional book is \'THe body keeps the score"" which will help you realize the path to recovery as well as the many other people suffering traumas around you, so you are not alone and this is curable! It was an assault, whether you had anything to do with it or not. It was wrong, and it needs to go into the past so you can live in the present! \n2.

You just as naturally resent the demands placed on females in so many ways- and you named several. It is perfectly right and natural to NOT WANT them!  But, society seems to demand it, and if you don\'t come out and publicly reject it, your visceral rejection is manifest as  dissociation,depression, dysphoria, etc.  THey solve the problem in a malign way.\n4. SO IMHO, Yes- go with genderqueer- means you can be girly or butch as you want, show off or hide your femaleness, adopt masculine behavior and manspread!

67,Help? I'm confused about my gender identity at the moment.,"Hello, I've made posts on the agender and non-binary subreddits about this topic before. But I want some more perspective. At the start of the month, I was in pain to the point that I felt like I needed to cry. Issue is that growing up I was told this and that about how I needed to toughen up as I'm a man. So I shouldn't cry. But at that moment when I was in pain, I realized that I didn't care anymore, and that if crying for whatever reason made me less of a man than so be it.  

Though, recently I've come to the realization that I don't care about my gender. I don't care to be a man, and even though I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be a woman. I don't want to be one either. Agender and non-binary make sense to me. As I'd rather just be myself and coexist in the world like gender really doesn't matter.

72,Am I female if sometimes I feel more feminine and sometimes more masculine?,"As the title says, I identify as a girl. I went through a period of questioning my own gender, I used labels like nonbinary, demigirl, genderqueer, etc. and always felt mild discomfort, since those didn't fully describe me. I immediately knew I disliked he/him pronouns and being seen as a man. Nonbinary and genderqueer took a bit more time, but eventually I concluded that those didn't really fit me right either. I first switched back to using she/her pronouns instead of any pronouns or she/they pronouns, and I felt better that way. I also realized that my problem wasn't really that I wanted to be something other than a girl, or that I felt like I wasn't a girl, it was that I felt like I didn't fit in to the traditional and rather stereotypical image of a girl. Which is why I ended up with the conclusion a bit ago that I am a girl.

I think what I had thought before was that if I identified as something other than a girl, then me not fitting in with traditional feminine stereotypes would finally make sense. What I disliked about being a girl was all the gender norms and social conventions about what I can or can't do if I'm a girl, added to the fact that I have some more traditionally masculine traits and habits. I had a very specific notion of what ""girl"" meant in my head - think stereotypical ""girly"", makeup, fragile, emotional, caring, feminine (I know I was very wrong) - and only now am I realizing that there's really no right way to be a girl or a woman. I'm now trying to detangle these outdated expectations and definitions of what being a woman means in my head. There are several older women in my life who don't fit these stereotypes either who I look up to a lot, and I'm trying to see them as a role model.

However, I'm still a bit insecure about how I dress. How I dress is a bit more androgynous, typically favoring looser clothes and pants over skirts and shorts. I'm not very feminine in appearance, as I have short hair (think like a male idol's hair, like Yoongi from BTS with his wolfcut), and I often prefer unisex and sometimes men's clothing. There have been times when I've enjoyed wearing men's clothes and looking more masculine (note: not feeling like a man or being a man, that's different). I imagine it's similar to how drag kings feel - it feels powerful, and fun, dressing as the opposite gender while knowing you're not. There have also been times when I favored women's clothing, like skirts, dresses, fancy flowery necklaces, crop tops, etc. I wouldn't describe myself as favoring hyper-feminine or very girly clothing - you couldn't catch me dead with frills or glittery jewelry or makeup, at least not yet - but I do feel feminine. I think this is more because I've been having body image issues that I haven't worn feminine clothes in a while, but I'm starting to embrace it again. Usually I just feel like myself. T-shirts and shorts and sweatpants, whatever's comfy works.

So yeah, did anybody else also go through something like this? I am a girl, just somewhat insecure in my choice of presenting myself.",10oe13k,16,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10oe13k/am_i_female_if_sometimes_i_feel_more_feminine_and/,"[""Genderqueer includes gender non-conforming presentation choices.

74,Last week I went to a trans discussion group for the first time and actually felt bad during the event and afterwards,"TL;DR: I started to identify as non-binary since relatively recently, I don‚Äôt have any non-binary friends yet. While everyone at the event was very nice, and some people seemed quite cool and relatable, I felt like I didn't fit in. At some point, I felt like I‚Äôm a woman (I‚Äôm afab) and that felt super bad. That leaves me confused once again about if I‚Äôm indeed an enby. I would much appreciate any help making sense of this experience.

I started to explore my gender for the first time last spring, concluded that I‚Äôm non-binary, changed my name and pronouns to they/them, and came out to most people in my life.

This was incredibly rough: the gender doubts, the never ending coming outs. While my cis gf was super supportive and there for me all the time, I did not have anyone non-binary or transitioning who was close to me, which made it rougher. Before last week, I had been relatively at peace with being non-binary, although gender doubts (if I‚Äôm non-binary or just a very confused cis woman) were still present and somewhat disturbing.

So now I‚Äôm trying to find a queer community to connect with and befriend.

Last week I went to a group focused on discussing trans experiences. Everyone was super nice and welcoming me specifically (since I was one of the few new people). I have strong social anxiety, so I was terrified as I often am in (new) social situations. 

In addition to my usual social fears, I also felt like I didn‚Äôt fit in‚Äîor was it rather a fear that I don‚Äôt fit in and hence won‚Äôt have a community I belong to? I think I was thinking something like ‚Äúam really queer like them‚Äù Did anyone perhaps have a similar experience?

Another very weird thing was that, somewhere in the middle of the evening, while we were discussing our non-binary experiences, I felt like a woman. (Most folks at the meetup were AFAB non-binary, like I (think) I am.) I had this feeling sometimes after I de-identified with womanhood and usually I thought it was coming from the outside, or from me thinking people around me think I‚Äôm a woman (it happened for example after I went to a meetup with cis people only to whom I wasn‚Äôt out).

This all leaves me confused about my gender once again, and it is unpleasant. What do you folks think? Does this experience mean anything about my gender identity, or could it be a weird consequence of my generic social fears to not fit in and not be accepted?",10np3bx,47,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10np3bx/last_week_i_went_to_a_trans_discussion_group_for/,"['It could be that you are feeling the age old worry of ""am I trans enough?"" This is a complicated feeling because there\'s actually so many ways to be trans and nb. You are not actually more or less trans if you have dysphoria or you choose medical transition, etc. But it kind of feels like that and makes things confusing. It could be you felt imposter syndrome because you felt their identities seemed more valid than yours (not true). Another possibility is maybe you are genderfluid and one of your genders is woman and you happened to feel that at that time. You can still be nonbinary if one of your gender experiences is aligned to your AGAB.\n\nI\'m also AFAB nonbinary and I\'ll tell you it was awkward the first time I went to a trans support group because I was, for the first time,  dysphoric thinking people would assume I was male identified due to reading me as AFAB.', '> I think I was thinking something like ‚Äúam really queer like them‚Äù\n\nI have doubts like this a fair bit.\n\nOne useful antidote I\'ve found is that basically, no, most of the time I am not really queer ""like them"". Especially in the world of ""genderqueer"" and ""non-binary"" experiences, one person\'s relationship to gender need not be like another person\'s relationship to gender. The fact that a bunch of queers aren\'t necessarily queer *like each other* is something I try to treat as a positive thing about queerness.\n\nOf course, it\'s bittersweet too. Part of the reason I crave queer community is that I crave a feeling of sameness with others. So it\'s tough to seek out that sameness and then find a lot of differentness. Fortunately, there\'s some sameness to be found too, but in my experience it\'s a more complex thing than ""I\'ve found my people"".\n\n> Does this experience mean anything about my gender identity, or ...\n\nFor me, the model of ""my gender identity"" as an essential thing about me that I am trying to discover facts about doesn\'t really hold together. I think the way I respond to every gendered interaction means *something* about my gender identity, but none of them mean *something essential* about my gender identity. So my version of this question would be ""is this experience a useful thread to tug on when it comes to sorting out my relationship to gender?"".\n\nAnd to that question, I would say yes (at any rate, the fact that you\'re here talking about it means you probably think yes on some level), but I think that version of the question is one with a less predetermined picture of *what* the meaning is.\n\nCertainly I think concluding that you\'re ""just a very confused cis woman"" based on this experience would be over-interpreting it.\n\n> This time though I was in the environment where I was least likely to be seen as a woman, and that‚Äôs why what happened seems so weird to me.\n\nOne possibility: You were also in an environment where being seen as a woman would be unusually painful for you. I\'ve got some defensive shields up when interacting during my day-to-day, and in queerer circles I want those shields to go down a bit (otherwise what\'s the point). But letting those shields down can come with a feeling of exposure and anxiety, especially if you\'re not used to it. To me a lot of this boils down to questions of trust, and trust is a messy and complicated and situational thing.\n\nPersonally, I often find myself ""stress-identifying"" with my AGAB in social situations where gender matters. A big part of the reason is that some part of me thinks I have to: if people are parsing me in terms of my AGAB anyway (or might be), and their interpretation of my behavior is sensitive to that, then I feel I *need to know* or otherwise I don\'t have a clear picture of my (possible) position in whatever social interaction I\'m in. So I ""need to"" parse my behaviors in terms of my AGAB too, at least in the back of my mind somewhere; so I\'m identifying with it in the back of my mind, etc. etc..\n\n(As an aside, this is why ""passing"" is appealing, I think; it\'s a direct way to let yourself take a rest from this process. But of course the ideas of ""passing"" and ""non-binary"" don\'t fit together in a simple way.)\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is that queer circles can still be a source of that stress. It can matter quite a bit in queer circles ""if you\'re cis"" or ""if you\'re trans"", and especially in conversations *about* gender, lots of things get parsed through a lens of ""who is this coming from"", specifically their gender identity. Or at any rate it can feel like that to me.', 'First off, good on you for putting up with the discomfort and going in the first place! Social anxiety alone is hard to work through, with the added layer of gender confusion you should give yourself a pat on the back. I\'m a big believer that those difficult thoughts and feelings are what ultimately lead us to a more solid send of self, even if it doesn\'t feel like it in the moment.\n\nI\'d also say feelings of being the outsider or not trans enough are pretty common.  I know personally, I have trouble feeling in touch with my gender when I meet new groups of trans/gender non-conforming folks. Seeing other people\'s gender performance can make me analyze how I perform my gender, which can lead to ""not enough"" feelings. For example, I\'m amab and occasionally like to grow out my facial hair. Internally, I don\'t feel like this changes anything about my gender identity, but when I see other nb people who are more visibly gnc and I just look like a dude with a beard, I feel self-conscious and question if I\'m *actually* trans, or am I just a dude who doesn\'t really subscribe to typical masculinity. What gives me some comfort is that I know how much I hate being seen as a man, and I know that when someone seems to truly understand and respect my gender identity, internally it feels much more real and I feel pretty great. In those moments I feel gender euphoria, so I can say for me, it\'s worry based rather than an actual reflection on my identity. So to answer:\n\n>could it be a weird consequence of my generic social fears to not fit in and not be accepted?\n\nOnly you can really answer but I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s the case.\n\nSearch this sub for ""trans enough"" and you find heaps of people having similar worries. If you feel safe enough it might even be worth bringing up within the group (it sounds like their pretty nice/understanding). I wouldn\'t be surprised if others were able to relate. Also, consider how much external judgment comes from cis people about NB identities, could some of this be internalized transphobia telling you you need to meet a certain benchmark?\n\nAlso, if it makes you feel any better I\'m part of a group and a conversation we\'ve had a few times is that if someone is having significant doubt and confusion about their gender, they are more than welcome to join and talk about it even if they don\'t 1000% identify as NB/trans. If someone joins, thinks through their gender identity, then comes to the conclusion that they just a non-conforming cis person, so be it. You\'re still working towards a better understanding of your gender and that\'s a worthwhile endeavor. So regardless of your identity, don\'t feel like doubt makes you an outsider, these are the kinds of conversations that are good to bring to the table because I can assure you, you are not alone.', 'I think many of us have that ""am I trans enough"" feeling sometimes. It\'s really similar to the experience I have with my sexuality too because I\'m bisexual. And then it\'s more complicated because I\'m afab but nonbinary, and I\'m perceived female and my spouse is a cis male who--if asked-- would identify as straight. And so I am constantly feeling like I\'m an imposter.\n\nBut I will say this: I spent about 3 years in an area where I really didn\'t have much queer support. I basically was ""back in the closet"" while I lived there I was just--perceived as a woman and no one really knew that I identified as nonbinary except my partner and one other person. And I won\'t necessarily say that I was unhappy during that time--it\'s more about the difference I felt when I started living more fully as my true gender. So after that time I had moved back in with my parents for my masters (this is late 2020) and I spent a LOT of time at home by myself or with my parents. \n\nI introduced myself with they/them pronouns to everyone I met in my classes and it was all online so there wasn\'t any presentation apart from my face and so there wasn\'t any gendering at all really. And when I started going back out more the next year when classes were in person I was binding again and choosing some days to be more masculine or to be more androgynous and no one gendered me as female ever or made those types of assumptions about me. And it was a feeling I hadn\'t had since I had last been with more of my queer community.\n\nEven so I would feel like a fake or question my gender sometimes. And recently I was having a conversation with my very good friend who is responsible for me learning about the trans community in the first place. I was talking to him about the fact that I told my partner about getting top surgery and --long-story-short-- the reaction sucked. And my friend said ""he\'s married to a non-binary person but he\'s never respected that"" \n\nAnd this realization dawned on me that--after all this time, while I\'ve been presenting more femme, and while I\'ve been dissociating from my gender. My friend never stopped thinking of me as a nonbinary person. He never questioned it. That\'s just who I was. And it felt really really good.\n\nGender is a spectrum so, if you adopt the label ""trans"" then you\'re trans enough. Only you can truly say what you\'re gender is--but when people who don\'t know about or who don\'t respect my gender gender me as femsle I feel weird about my gender, and being around people who I perceived as being ""more trans"" than me made me feel like an imposter. I think continuing to be aware of whay makes you feel good and what makes you feel like yourself is a great thing as self care. But try to think of yourself not in relation to other trans people, but just as you. What feels good, what doesn\'t? Was your question about your gender because you didn\'t like being perceived as nonbinary? Or was it because you didn\'t feel like you related to the way other nonbinary people presented or talked about their gender? \n\nI highly recommend sticking with those community meetings so thay you are around people who--even if they present differently can relate to your experience in some way and who will affirm how you feel to you.\n\nBut, in the mean time, if I may... hi u/society_acceptable it\'s great to meet you! I recognize you as a nonbinary person. And as long as you are identifying as nonbinary I will see you that way because that is who you are. Until you decide differently, no matter how you express your gender outwardly, I will remember that you are nonbinary. Welcome to the community!\n\n(And if you want a virtual NB friend to converse with--ask questions, celebrate things, commiserate, or whatever-- in a less public forum, my dms are open. My name is Lauren and I\'m 28 and non-binary/transmasc and I use any pronouns.)', ""It's all such a wide and varied spectrum. \nJeez, I'm 45 and still attempting work out all out. \n\nI think I'm at the conclusion that there is nothing always overly complicated to work out, and clinging so hard to finding a label for what we are can be as limiting and 'binary' as the conventional definitions of gender ü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è. This is my (naive) personal experience anyway."", ""The first time I went to a trans group, everyone else was a binary, conventionally masculine FTM - short hair, traditional male clothes, etc. I had long hair, was a metalhead and was pre-everything. I felt out of place and like maybe I was being judged, but people were nice.\n\nDo you think you were being affected by your own fears or the vibe of the group?\n\nIt might be worth going to a few trans groups and seeing how you feel.\n\nYou could also try opening up about these feelings to the group. What you described is a really common experience. Other people might relate. You might actually make them feel less alone in what they're dealing with.\n\nOur experiences of gender aren't static. It's normal to go through different gender experiences regardless of who you are or where you are in your transition. I don't know if cis people experience this, but I know a lot of trans and enby people do. Don't let the low points define you. You get to define your gender any way you want.""]"

A lot of it does have to do with autism unfortunately, but not in the way most people think. With autism we struggle to identify the grey areas (which in this case we actually fall into) and therefore struggle to accept them.

77,Can someone help me w/ finding a label?,"Im afab and probably somewhat enby. Im fine using this label as in most cases, ppl wont even know more specific terms. Tho I'd like to make it more specifc for myself in order to label my orientation. Basically, I dont feel a strong sense of gender ig as I dont feel lots of dysphoria: it fluctuates and depends on the situation. If I have it, its fairly mild. I still want to be called masculine/neutral terms. Being seen as anything other than my agab makes me really happy.

I dont think I feel like a boy tho. I dont think I'd fit the expectations that come with it. But for some reason, I still feel happy when I imagine myself being feminine the way men can be feminine, but not in a girls way. Performing my masculinity as soft in some way. Like, being the feminine guy in a friend group w/ girls. The idea of being seen as a pretty boy makes me happy. But I'd feel more comfortable being seen as androgynous/neutral around guys. Mainly because I feel like im not as boy as they are.

78,Finally came out and can't believe I waited so long,"So after pretty much a lifetime of crossdressing in secret (starting at age 8!), then purging my wardrobe, only to restart months or years later, I finally came out in December as nonbinary, genderqueer, gender fluid.

The road to coming out started with my AFAB nonbinary partner, who continually encouraged me to accept myself. Then I started playing around with a glam androgyne look for every day. They loved it and continued encouraging me, until I finally realized that girl-me is as much a part of me as boy-me, maybe even more.

So now I'm daily wearing eye makeup. I wear full makeup for nights out. My wardrobe currently is masc clothes with a femme side -- lace, satin, leather -- and androgynous items (knitwear, mainly). Skintght jeans and knee-high (flat) black boots. And tomorrow I'm going out as androgyne in leather pants with stiletto heels. It's kind of dressing like a girl while dressing like a boy.

And now I'm happily reconstructing a wardrobe after having thrown everything away about six years ago when I swore I'd never dress up again.

I am very happy to report that dressing up whenever I want is a much better alternative!

My partner can't get enough of me now -- ""It's about time,"" they said when I came out to them. ""Finally, I have a girlfriend!"" (They are leaning into a more butch look.)

86,Questioning gender after realising my way of thinking isn't universal - need advice,"I (28m) have identified as bi and/or pansexual for years now, and use he/him pronouns and never really questioned it, but following a discussion with my partner (31f, ally), and then speaking to a few other friends, I've realised that an experience of mine isn't universal - and I don't know what that means. As such I've come here for your advice.

I'm a big guy, I'm almost 6'4, have a beard.etc. And I'm pretty confident in myself, I feel like a handsome man most of the time. But sometimes I wish I was small and cute. Or sometimes I wish I was smoky and sexy (as ephemeral of a term as that may be). I tried to explain this to people, or just said it as a ""you know that feeling when..."" story to see if they empathized, but have generally gotten blank stares.

// Expanded story, TLDR from next slashes //

I was watching a tv show with my partner and I commented that a sleeveless hoodie a character in the show was wearing was really cute. My partner laughed and said she couldn't imagine me in a sleeveless hoodie. To which I said that of course it wouldn't suit it as me, but if I was a short, cute, girl - I'd wear the heck out of that hoodie.

She looked befuddled, and I explained instead of wearing cargo shorts and a baggy t-shirt on a hot day I sometimes wish I had something which made me feel flowy and ethereal like a summer dress. I'm glad that I'm a big lump of a man because I like how I fill a suit; but also sometimes I wish I was sleek and slender and I could rock up into a black tie event in a black dress, or something which had a similar essence.

Most of the time I enjoy being one of the tallest people in the room, and love being the gentle giant of my friend group; but on occasion I feel more like I want to be small, and be scrappy without the responsibility of being a big ol' tree of a man and having to be careful because of that. Similarly whenever I've been in a relationship I often like being big and being able to be a big spoon, being large enough that someone can lean on me like a cushion comfortably; but I also sometimes wish I could just be small, be able to lean on someone without crushing them, be able to just follow my partner without people assuming that I'm the one that's going to book a table or make the orders.etc

I've had a similar conversation with several other people since to check, and I've come to realise this isn't a universal experience, which I had just assumed it was. I don't know if that's because I'm asking the wrong people. There's not much of an LGBT scene in my town so I don't have anyone here to discuss it with to work out what it means.

// End of long version of story //

TLDR: I've previously often wished I was a bit more androgynous - but my face looks god awful without a beard and so I grow it out. I'd thought all of this was a universal experience, had just assumed every guy felt a bit like this, but so far that doesn't seem to be the case.

Is this another part of my LGBT'ness which I had just assumed was a general human experience? Is it somewhere on the genderqueer spectrum? Or is it just a run of the mill dislike of gender norms? I'd love to know your thoughts and whether you had a moment like this....",10ffnll,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10ffnll/questioning_gender_after_realising_my_way_of/,"['I\'m a tiny, meek, feminine person, so I probably can\'t give you much advice or insight, here. \n\n What I will tell you is you should try on some ""feminine"" clothes? If you want to wear a flowy, pink dress or a fucking sleeveless hoodie then go for it. Life\'s too short to refrain from wearing certain things bc of your body. Sure, you can\'t magically shapeshift into a 5\'3 girl, but if you want to wear a sleeveless hoodie, do it. It\'s better to try clothes on in person however you may not want to do that if you live in a small town and you don\'t want people to know you\'re buying ""women\'s"" clothing, which is ridiculous, because it\'s just clothing, but i get it. Yoir wife is probably a nice person and just made that low key hurtful comment about the hoodie without much thought. Would you open to her picking up some clothes for you? Or maybe a friend who you\'re more comfortable with. You could order clothes online and have someone pick it up in store for you if you don\'t want to do it in person. It\'s probably better if you have to return clothes if they\'re the wrong size. Also, women\'s clothing sizing is the most fucked up thing ever I swear to God\'s. Ask your wife about it lol. I mean, buying clothes online is the most discreet option if you don\'t want your wife to know. And you can wear clothes inside your home at first. Do you think she would shame you or anything if you talked to her about it in more depth? Experimenting with things like nail polish, makeup, and even different pronouns could be nice? \n\nRemember it doesn\'t have to be a big deal. You can wear a dress, heels, lipstick, whatever, and go back to living life the way it was before. Your masculinity isn\'t going to run away and hide under the bed if you wear a dress lol. Hell, maybe you won\'t like it, and you\'ll never have to wear anything like that again. It could be a really positive experience. It could be neutral and you\'ll think ""Eh, probably not doing that again."" And you can put the hoodie in the closet and never think about it again (at least until you clean out your closet). \n\n Also, it\'s easy to feel alienated and alone when you can\'t find anyone else who feels the same way you do. You\'re not alone, though. My experience of feeling alienated is a lot different than yours yet it has some similarities. I\'ve been questioning my gender for a couple years, now and it\'s hard yk. Queerness in general isn\'t spoken about in a positive light irl, at least where I live. I promise you thousands of people have had the same thoughts and feelings around being a man and gender expression and everything.\n\nPersonally, I\'m not really sure if this makes you genderqueer. It could mean that you\'re on the genderqueer spectrum, or it could be that you want to wear a dress every now and then. Men\'s fashion is really bland ngl. You don\'t have to label it if you don\'t want to. It\'s possibly connected to your sexual orientation. Many butch lesbians and feminine gay men bend gender norms. Maybe you like the idea of letting go of the responsibility of being a gentle giant, and you see becoming a woman as sort of a way to escape that? What you described would change the way people percieve and treat you. Bending gender norms can be caused by a wide range of shit, and I think you should explore and have fun while figuring this out.']"

90,Posing in photos as an androgynous trans human.,"Last year I had top surgery, next month I'm departing on a three month backpacking trip across New Zealand and I finally want to like how I look in pictures!

As a dysphoric and deeply closeted kid of a photographer I have long disliked my body and having pictures taken of it. However, I'm finally starting to dress how I like, and feel, if not good, at least tolerant of my body. Now I'm going on this epic trip with this new chest and new outlook and I want to look back at these photos and really feel good about them.

Do y'all have any tips, tricks, or ideas for how a chubby 30-something can finally feel like a studly babe in photos?",10dyr09,15,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10dyr09/posing_in_photos_as_an_androgynous_trans_human/,"['i recommend looking up videos on youtube on how to pose!', 'I used to do a lot of (admittedly very femme) modeling in the past and the best tips I can give are posture and most importantly confidence! üòä If you feel good you‚Äôre gonna look a hundred times happier in photos and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll remember most anyway! \n\nIf you‚Äôd like some specific posing tips, I‚Äôd say stand tall (imagine a string at the top of your head pulling you up straight), shoulders back and down, feet apart.

91,another year approaches with more doubt and questions,"I'm currently in my late twenties with my birthday just around the corner. I've grown up never really feeling the need to assign a gender or sexuality to myself. Part of that I can say was partially because I didn't need it to validate how I felt as a person, but I also can't deny part of it was because I just didn't want to think about it. I didn't want to put thought into something that could end up changing so much of my life.
 Now that I'm approaching another birthday and getting even closer to my thirties I feel like everything I've put off thinking about is becoming more pressing than ever. I know I want to start a family in the future and settle down with someone. So I find myself trying to sort out what I feel as a person and how I want to experience the world. I feel like I'm so far behind though. I think I've come to terms tho with being nonbinary at least though. I don't really mind being called any pronouns but they/them are probably my most comfortable ones. I feel like I'm just a person and I don't want my gender being a defining factor of that. When a person sees me I'd rather they see me for who I am rather than just my gender. Buy with that acceptance now comes the questioning on if I should start a low dose of hormones and have top surgery to achieve what I think would be a body I'm a bit more comfortable in. I know I'm extremely lucky and know that if I didn't have that option I could live the rest of my life just fine . Sometimes I even really like how I come across in feminine form, but most of the time I feel myself discouraged by how often I'm perceived as a girl. 
 Along with that stress of identification I find myself also struggling with my sexuality now too. I feel like most people have experimented and know who they are or what they like by this point in life. I feel like when meeting people it's expected of me to be sure of who I am. And I believe that myself to some point. I don't feel like another person should have to go through the stress of being with me while I don't even know who I am. I can't expect someone to form a connection with me when I can't even form a connection with myself. But I also find myself wanting to connect with someone who would help me through this. Not as a guide or to tell me what I should or shouldn't do but to assure me it it's going to be okay. Someone who would some what understand and I could discuss things with. Also someone willing to take the lead and show me things. Someone who wouldn't shame me for not knowing things when already being this far in life.

I'm sorry for the ramble and the awful format. I've typed this up on my phone in a moment of internal reflection. If anything in this goes against any guidelines in this forum please feel free to take it down. I am still knew to how reddit works and haven't had much experience in posting. I just felt it would be nice to speak this into the void and see if maybe anyone else could understand what I was thinking.

92,Is there an easy way...,"...to hide and/or temporarily remove body hair without shaving?

To set things straight, I'm genderfluid AMAB. I have a very masculine build --- broad shoulders, defined muscles (esp. biceps & legs), pretty tall, thick body, &c. --- and I'm fine with that a good 90% of the time, even when I'm feminine. I like being a big person, physically, especially with the fact that I'm slowly becoming more *husky* and not just *fat.* I've lost a significant amount of fat but remain that burly-big build that I like.

The problem with having an incredibly masculine build, however, is what testosterone does to your body. I love all of my body and facial hair when I'm masculine, but when I'm feminine I absolutely abhor it. That's the biggest problem, honestly; I don't want HRT because I'm worried that shaving my hair and going on it would prevent it from growing back without me going off of HRT which feels like it would make the whole thing useless. 

Some temporary solutions I've found are compression sleeves and long pants, which I do like the look of but feel like they'd get hot in the summertime and just get annoying after a while. I have some sensory issues from a mix of ADHD and autism which makes tight-fitting clothes not the best solution.

This is where the issue comes in. I'm most concerned about my arm hair, which I have quite a lot of, and my leg hair. I usually present as a certain gender for weeks to months at a time (I believe I've presented as male for about a month and a half as of writing which is a new record) but I'm worried about my hair still being visible or removed when I'm feeling feminine and masculine respectively.

Are there any good and preferably cheap alternatives to shaving? Due to the aforementioned sensory issues I have problems with shaving in particular. Cheers!",10d3ab6,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/10d3ab6/is_there_an_easy_way/,"[""The main alternatives to shaving I know of are either waxing or some king of hair removal cream or spray. Other than that you could try really opaque stockings which can hide leg hair without being as warm as tights/pants, but that'll depends on your sensory issues.\n\nGood luck and hope this helps!"", ""I personally use nair which is a hair removal cream! i get the one for legs but i use it just about everywhere other than my face. I just leave in on for less time for places like my armpits where the skin thinner and more sensitive. I think the cream is under $10 and for me it lasts for at least a few applications though i don't use it everywhere every time. i think there's probably a similar cream for faces but I don't know for sure. Hope this helps and I wish you luck as you figure things out!""]"

Someone posted a screenshot of a post by a woman whose sister-in-law is an influencer, and is majorly into makeup and the like.

I don‚Äôt fucking ***want*** a frilly pink straightjacket, and so many people are convinced that if you have a vagina you do want that, and anybody who says they don‚Äôt is either jealous or just not doing things properly. Makes me want to scream Sojourner Truth‚Äôs speech at them. 

I hate the manosphere and Robert Bly and all that with a passion, and ditto for ‚ÄúThe Total Woman‚Äù. I just want to be a person, and like the things I like, and do the things I want to do, and wear the things I want to wear and not have a pile of gender horseshit piled on me. 

I‚Äôm fat (and 59) and I don‚Äôt look at myself in the mirror much, but it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm fat. I‚Äôm fat because I hate having people *looking* at me, and now I‚Äôm happily invisible. At nineteen I had the exact same measurements as Marilyn Monroe did in her heyday, and my breasts just kept getting bigger and bigger. It got to feeling like everything that makes me, me, was just a carrying case for the boobs, and I *hated* it. I went butch in my thirties, but I was also part of the BDSM community, and being a top gets you just as objectified as being a girl with boobs does. I joined the Orthodox Jewish community, and finally everybody left me alone. (I also got breast reduction surgery when I was forty or so because they were killing my back. Lost seven pounds that way.)

Twenty-some-odd years later, I‚Äôm quite happy being Jewish, although I‚Äôm nowhere near as observant as I was, but quite over dressing female. I‚Äôm bringing back my butch self, but identifying as non-binary. I am thoroughly torn between ‚ÄúI want to be a woman just as I am‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck it, I don‚Äôt want a gender, I just want to be myself‚Äù. 

And, oddly, I feel much more comfortable with the idea of painting my very short nails while I‚Äôm wearing menswear than otherwise.

I‚Äôm AFAB and have always thought I was cis, just not very feminine. As a kid being around other girls made me uncomfortable - I used to hate femininity and was much more comfortable spending time with boys and doing ‚Äúboy‚Äù things. I still feel this way most of the time, but now I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because society taught me to hate femininity (that it was weak/inferior), or if it‚Äôs because I knew I was different. I hated being separated into boys and girls groups and hated that my high school made me wear either a skirt or a dress when I was much more comfortable in shorts (both physically and emotionally).

Lately I‚Äôve been playing around with different names and she/they pronouns (with myself, I haven‚Äôt voiced this to anyone yet), and my given name makes me cringe sometimes. I never used to have a problem with it, but now I‚Äôm not attached to it at all. I also think I might be experiencing dysphoria a bit but idk.

114,I'm questioning my gender after 30 years. Help?,"So for my whole life I've just been okay with being assigned the male gender, it doesn't feel particularly wrong, but I don't fit the definition well. 

I'm equally at home chopping firewood, sewing, cooking, building a shed. I'm not a fan of sports or using makeup on myself. I'd wear large earrings if my social environment was more friendly to nontraditional displays of gender.

I recently discovered that I'm not straight either. I haven't figured out a good label for that. I'm attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people, and probably trans people, but I don't know any. My guess is pan- or poly-sexual.

I just really feel gender-nonconforming in all of my interests and internal dialog, but I'm comfortable with being externally labeled as a man. I feel like this is especially difficult for me since I'm trying to figure it out at 30 years old. Like my identity is crystallized already in my mind...

I always felt more fem around boys but more masc around girls. I never wanted a boys body, especially the genitelia so I never considered myself to be trans. I saw gender as just the organs you had. If you had a female body = girl, if you had a males body = boy and if you wanted to have a males body as a 'girl', you were a transboy. I never had problems with locker rooms or toilets as I thought ""i have a females body so this is just my place to go"". 

Now that ive come to the understanding that being trans isnt just a black and white thing, I started to explore my feelings. There was this one time someone asked me if I was a boy, and I felt oddly happy. Not because they thought I was a boy, but because they didnt saw me as a girl. It was the question of a kid, just genuine curiousity, no harmful intentions, so it made me really happy. This made me question if I were perhaps non-binary. It wasnt the first time someone asked me, but if they did it was always done with a harmful intent which obviously doesnt gives any person euphoria.

After that euphoric moment, I started to develop dysphoria. Terms like girl/lady/madem/miss etc felt instinctually wrong as well as she/her pronouns. Having a female chest started to feel weird, even just looking in the mirror or seeing my shadow which reveals the shape of my waist caused me discomfort. I dont wanna have a 100% boys body tho. Maybe top surgery and bottom growth would be nice. Not sure if I wanna change my voice tho. Actually I do, as I cant listen to my high pitched voice without feeling uncomfortable but im afriad it may get too deep if I start T. Maybe I will regret it. I wanna dress more masc and I always sorta feel a gravitional pull towards the males clothing section. Androgynous ppl and feminine men make me slightly envy them

But im also scared of the possibility I might not be a girl. My family is quite transphobic towards enby's so I'd be a social shame. I cant get real euphoria if I ID as an enby as I will only get the hear negative comments. I dont have alot of queer friends IRL and online so I cant really experiment either and maybe I will regret transitioning as im scared of change. 


So, could this also be an experience of a cis-girl? As ive heard some butch women may also experience dysphoria in relation to feminity and their bodies.",103270s,52,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/103270s/can_cis_people_experience_gender_dysphoria/,"['I think it‚Äôs important to shed more light on the fact that cis people experience gender dysphoria a lot.

We‚Äôre fed this messaging about motherhood, and their body won‚Äôt do that thing! They start to question their own femininity. There are loads of examples of how cis people experience gender dysphoria.', '[removed]', 'AFAB here who considers themselves trans and non-binary. Everything you‚Äôre describing is pretty similar to what convinced me I was n-b. I also have no interest in bottom surgery. You don‚Äôt have to have any desire for physical change to be trans. I‚Äôve known I‚Äôm trans for several years now and I haven‚Äôt looked into surgery/testosterone at all because I still don‚Äôt feel prepared. Definitely experiment with less permanent things before you make any major decisions. Even if you don‚Äôt *want* any surgical change or hormone therapy, if the idea of being perceived not as a girl is appealing, you‚Äôre probably trans and/or non-binary.\n\nEspecially with what you‚Äôre saying about not liking feminine terms or wishing your body appeared more masculine. I‚Äôm not going to tell you who you are, because that‚Äôs for you to decide, but I will say that I‚Äôve had (and continue to have) those feelings too, and that‚Äôs what makes me so sure I‚Äôm trans. But that‚Äôs right now! Maybe down the road you‚Äôll start to feel comfortable being seen as a woman again and that‚Äôs okay. Things change and you shouldn‚Äôt regret this time of exploring or think you were misled.\n\nThe possibility of things changing shouldn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt explore right now. Even if you don‚Äôt have queer friends, if you know they‚Äôre allies, maybe you can still talk to them about it and ask them to try out different pronouns. There‚Äôs also this handy website for trying different pronouns if you‚Äôre not ready to ask anybody just yet: http://www.pronouns.failedslacker.com/\n\nTry more masculine clothes, if you have the budget try binding (look into binding health and safety first, it‚Äôs easy to get hurt!), maybe cut your hair more masculinely if that‚Äôs not too permanent for you, etc., and see if you feel more like yourself. You‚Äôll probably have to spend a good deal of time trying out new things and really processing how you feel about it. But that‚Äôs okay, because there‚Äôs no deadline you have to meet. You don‚Äôt need to figure it out so soon. There‚Äôs no rush.\n\nAll this being said, I thought I was a butch lesbian for years because of these experiences. What made me realize I wasn‚Äôt was actually realizing I had a thing for a guy friend of mine, but I was worried about leaving the label behind because the term butch suited me so well. There‚Äôs a lot of discourse on whether non-lesbians can use it, if you‚Äôre curious about it, but we don‚Äôt need to get into it right now. So, I suppose somebody with your experiences could be a butch, but it depends on how you use the term. Some women use it as a simple adjective to note that they have more masculine expression, others use it as its own gender identity, another form of womanhood or perhaps not related to womanhood at all.\n\nTLDR: Your experiences are very similar to mine, as a person AFAB who considers themselves trans and non-binary. I think it‚Äôs too early to start looking into physical changes like surgery or hormone therapy, nor do you need those to be legitimately trans. If you want to be perceived as something other than a girl, that‚Äôs pretty trans IMO. Your feelings right now might change later down the line and that‚Äôs okay, that doesn‚Äôt mean exploring was a waste of time or that you were ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù Sometimes peoples‚Äô relationship with their gender changes and that‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Don‚Äôt let that hinder you from exploring. Your friends don‚Äôt have to be queer to ask them to try different pronouns, or you can use this website: http://www.pronouns.failedslacker.com/. Try more masculine clothes, if you have the budget try binding (look into binding health and safety first, it‚Äôs easy to get hurt!), maybe cut your hair more masculinely if that‚Äôs not too permanent for you, etc., and see if you feel more like yourself. Don‚Äôt expect an epiphany, be prepared to spend a lot of time experimenting and trying to figure out how you feel about it. All this being said, I suppose it‚Äôs possible to experience these things as a butch, it really just depends on how you use and define the term.\n\nSorry for the long comment and I hope it‚Äôs not too confusing.

122,The importance of underwear - starting in early childhood. Share your story?,"Another poster mentioned reviving a memory of having borrowed his sister's underwear and feeling like that was more right than his own, when still a small child. 

My first transgender experience was age 4, seeing my sister's underwear come down the laundry chute, and thinking- oh those are better \[no Y front\]. I took them and made them my own, and life seemed right, until my parents found out and violently let me know it was not ok to dress like a girl. 

Years later, I realized that I simply do feel like I am a girl, way more than half the time, and that has profound effects. I gradually took up secret crossdressing as a way to try to feel whole, and only late in life have I finally just accepted that I am at the extreme end of mannish women, but a woman at heart. 

I noticed in a you tube by parents whose very young female child kept insisting they were a boy, that the first request of the child once the mom indicated she was going to be supportive,  was- ""Can I have  boys underwear?""  

I theorize that underwear has speical imprtance because it is the first item of clothing to be given to you once you are out of diapers, and it will come with an announcement- these are for you bc you are a boy or girl. And if you reach for the 'other' one, you are corrected, so it is the first prison fence, soon to be overlaid by gendered clothes and shoes and hair. 

 After puberty women's underwear starts to be used as sexual signaling, and is more delicate and ornate, signifying the special status of women \[in the eyes of men, at least\] . It is an instrument of seduction, and straight men frequently want to try it on- to enter into the magic!

Though by standards of 2004 we were pretty woke in my household I always got the story... "" You can\'t wear that the other boys will make fun of you and call you a girl"" this just sent the need to dress like a girl into hiding and made it a shameful activity so I (okay walls down, in the other post I used the word borrowed but let\'s be real I was not planning on giving them back) stole one of my sister\'s lacy thongs I can still picture it silky and white and just a little bit too big for me. But it being a little bit too big for me would end up being my undoing I came home from school one day and I was wearing shorts but they were the dress pants kind because my school had a dress code but they were also just a little loose on my frame which meant that the thong I was wearing underneath would show if I was not careful but I was nine have ADHD and can\'t focus on anything to save my life (even less then because I refused to take my Ritalin at the time) so this was of no consequence to me, until my chosen mom (now, not then) noticed that I was wearing a thong and asked me where I had gotten them and what the hell I was doing wearing them. I being quick on my feet told her that it must have gotten mixed up in the laundry and I just didn\'t notice.... She knew, she definitely knew because I knew she\'d seen my sister wearing those very panties. So the next chance I got I washed them and returned them and I thought my sister was none the wiser until 11 years later when we were out for drinks and ramen and she abruptly asked me why I had gone through the trouble of stealing a pair of her panties when I could have just asked her to buy me a pair instead I was so stunned I almost choked on a chunk of braised pork, she giggled and said I love you bro, and I paid for her wine.\n\nSo for something traumatic happening it ended well.\nI\'m glad I could continue my story with you lovely people.\n\nAnd for the record I\'m genderqueer and use He/Him/His She/Her/Hers pronouns', 'One time when I was around 10 I got a training bra in some hand me downs and when I tried it on I panicked and flailed around until my mom got it off.

123,Nervous to change my pronouns/identity,"(AMAB) I don't know how it is meant to feel, I've been a man with he/him pronouns for my life so far but recently I've been called some more gender neutral terms such as partner instead of bf which I much prefer.

Being anything other than the binary wasn't really an option or something spoken about growing up due to the nature of the kind of environment i grew up in but i was always very feminine and struggled to fit in and identify with lots of boys i was at school with and i was often teased lots and called slurs to describe gay people for being very feminine.

I've never wrapped round my head around it fully and I'd describe my sexuality as mainly into women, I used to say straight but that doesn't seem to fit because I've met many NB or genderqueer people I've been attracted to.

I don't know if anyone has has a similar experience, I've thought about changing my pronouns but some people I've met and someone i dated made me feel like if i did that I'd be some impostor.

I'm very comfortable with who I am and how I dress and talk etc. but I don't know how to navigate finding what fits for me",101wkwt,39,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/101wkwt/nervous_to_change_my_pronounsidentity/,"['All you need to do to ""qualify"" for different pronouns is like it when you are called them.

I hereby give permission for you to choose pronouns that feel good to you. You can identify as nonbinary or genderqueer or another thing if that feels right to you. You can change your name if you want to. \n\nAs for your sexuality, it can be hard to describe when certain identities imply your gender as well. Some people mostly or exclusively into women identify as gynosexual which doesn\'t imply your own gender. Some people into women and nonbinary people might ID as bi, polysexual or omnisexual. Some people might just say queer, though if you are read as a man and not into men you may sometimes have to clarify if people misunderstand.', 'Experiment! There‚Äôs no harm in asking people to use certain pronouns for you for a while and then changing your mind later down the road, or trying to dress more androgynously/femininely and deciding it isn‚Äôt for you. If you have friends that have a problem with you trying to get to know yourself, maybe they‚Äôre not very good friends.\n\nIt‚Äôs also important to keep in mind that expression =/= identity, as in, you can express yourself very androgynously or femininely and not consider yourself any less of a man. Some people use pronouns to this effect (for example, cis women using he/him to express themselves more masculinely)‚Äîbut the line does get blurry and you may end up more confused using this train of thought than just considering being transgender and/or non-binary.\n\nI will say, the preferring ‚Äúpartner‚Äù over ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù does seem a bit trans to me, just speaking as a trans person. And you can still be largely attracted to women and be trans/non-binary. By today‚Äôs understanding, sexuality and gender are mostly separate, so don‚Äôt assume that just because you prefer women you are somehow inherently more of a man.\n\nFiguring out the ‚Äútruth‚Äù of your identity (if there is such a thing) is a long and difficult process, so it‚Äôs unfair to expect some random epiphany. Take your time, experiment, try new things, change your mind. It can be really stressful when you‚Äôre questioning, but try your hardest not to be impatient, and give yourself the time and space to explore. The overarching question tends to be this: ‚ÄúDo I want people to perceive me as something other than a man?‚Äù Do you prefer the term ‚Äúpartner‚Äù for external reasons, or does the idea of being considered something other than a boy seem appealing to you? Do you just happen to have feminine attributes or do you truly want to be seen as more feminine? None of these questions are easy to answer, nor do they have simple answers. But they surround the big idea that you‚Äôre trying to get at, so I hope they can help you on your journey.\n\nTLDR: Experiment with how you express yourself and identify, and don‚Äôt let the people around you get to you. Just because you have more feminine attributes doesn‚Äôt necessarily make you trans/non-binary, but it‚Äôs worth considering given your example about the term ‚Äúpartner‚Äù vs. ‚Äúboyfriend.‚Äù Ask yourself whether you just happen to have more androgynous or feminine traits, or if you actually want to be perceived as something other than a man.

I experience limited/ambiguous romantic attraction towards men. The label genderqueer transmasc makes me comfortable in my masc identity while also not being confined by the role of transmasc in society as im raised as a girl so I ""naturally"" like more feminine things and behave more feminine. Also using genderqueer bcoz I may actually be somewhat enby or demiboy/libramasc but I dont wanna restrict myself too much by specifying it.

So now that im starting to accept im transmasc, I cant see myself in a romo/qpr-relationship with a guy anymore. Maybe its bcoz of the hetero normative society we live in, but I think I'd always be more ""feminine"" compared to men due to my personality which would mean I'd be the ""girl in the relationship"" which I do not want! But being seen as supposed to be ""the same gender"" in a relationship with a dude would feel like a competition for me. Needing to be masculine enough, needing to ""prove"" it, being afraid theyre 'more' masc than I am etc. Due to this, I can only imagine myself in a theoritical relationship with women. It would feel less pressured as I'd naturally be the ""man in the relationship"" so it would be less of an competition and thus, more desirable. But I have never been romantically/sexually attracted to specifc women before.

Also, im toric but I can only see myself having a relationship w a dude if im personality wise more feminine (but not in a girlish way).

138,"Misgendering in t4nb relationships / Being treated as a ""fill in the blank"" when dating","Hey! So I (20, transmasc nb) use they/them pronouns and identify as pansexual but usually seek out t4t relationships. (I'm also pre-op so I don't pass for a guy super often just yet, but I make it clear to all my partners that I feel more aligned with masculinity than with feminity.) **T4T/ Nb4Nb/ T4Nb is supposed to be a safe dynamic** for nb and trans ppl, but something I've been noticing, especially with 2 of my past pre-op trans partners, is this **trend of assigning me whatever gender role validates their own identity** at a given moment, so I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with this because I can't tell if I'm going crazy.

To elaborate, I started dating both of these people while they were still just starting to question their genders, the first person was FTM and the second was MTF.

With the FTM partner, he used to affirm my identity as an nb when he wanted a sympathetic listener to talk about his dysphoria and questioning journey, but in most other contexts he'd treat me like a girl or slip & call me his gf. I always got the vibe that it was because me being ""the girl"" in the relationship made him feel more like ""the guy,"" but I never confirmed this.

With the (then bisexual) MTF partner, she also acknowledged my genderqueerness when she wanted to talk about maybe transitioning, and she *also* frequently talked about how much she wanted to be a lesbian & have our love be sapphic. We both know/knew ""lesbian"" can generally refer to relationships between any 2 non-men, not just 2 binary women, but she also frequently slipped and used she/her pronouns for me, and I was her first AFAB partner. <-- This made me suspect she also saw me as a girl to the extent that it made her feel more valid as a budding lesbian trans woman, especially because she didn't consider any of her past relationships with genderqueer non-op/pre-op AMABs to be sapphic in nature. ([Also idk if this context is necessary, but it's relatively common for trans people's sexualities to shift or change altogether as they transition, she was going through something similar, article further explaining this linked](https://www.them.us/story/sexual-attraction-after-transition))

So yeah, can any other nb people relate to experiencing this sort of misgendering (or any misgendering tbh) within t4t or t4nb dynamics / having your trans partner basically act like you being nonbinary means they can assign you whatever role makes them feel euphoric? And do any binary trans people have thoughts on this as well? I'm hoping these two situations were just unfortunate coincidences and not evidence of a widespread problem, but I feel kinda alone and I'm not sure how to address this if it happens again.

Also plz lmk if there's any problematic language or implications in here! I've been having a really hard time figuring out what to look up to find discourse on this specific issue, (seems like the only kind of nb-exclusion/invalidation ppl want to talk abt is transmedicalism), so I have no clue whether I might accidentally be feeding some obscure misconceptions or stereotypes about binary trans folx.

Like yes every orientation can and does include attraction to some nonbinary people, but that does not mean that every individual nonbinary persons gender is a fill in the blank where it can be whatever suits their partners orientation. It's definitely not specific to t4t relationships tho. Cis people do this too and treat us like us being nonbinary means they can interpret our gender as whatever they want or find attractive. No. My gender is not fill in the blank it is _my_ gender and it means something to me and I want to be loved as I am, not as the man or woman you imaginhe me to be."", 'Hey so I‚Äôm trans feminine and comfortable enough with most people thinking of me as a binary trans woman so my experience will be a bit different. I prefer T4T relationships overall for the shared experience but I‚Äôve been realizing I prefer dating nonbinary folk specifically. Mostly because a feel more seen by nonbinary folk (things like using she/they pronouns right, understanding that expressing myself as and wanting general society to see me as a woman doesn‚Äôt make me a woman necessarily) and also nonbinary people seem to share neurodivergence  with me more often which is so comforting.\n\nAnyway, in my experience binary trans folk early in their transition almost seem to need some gender essentialism as part of the process. I can relate to it, you kind of have to learn the rules of ‚Äúwoman‚Äù in opposition to those of ‚Äúman‚Äù in order to pass more easily and it can be easy to get lost in that mindset and forget that nonbinary people exist. And I‚Äôve seen a few people use their partners as a tool in the passing process since society at large is more likely to try to code you as a heterosexual couple than as a gay couple. Most peoples brains really struggle with flexibility much more than anyone likes to admit.\n\nI‚Äôve even noticed it in myself. I‚Äôve been dating a nonbinary person for the past couple of weeks. I caught myself cuz misgendering them once already and am catching my mind do it now and then and I‚Äôm having to train myself out of it to see them properly. It takes a little intentional effort when we‚Äôre trained from birth to think there are only two genders.\n\nI think you‚Äôll have better luck with other nonbinary folk and trans folk further into transition. Sorry to hear you‚Äôve had to deal with that. It‚Äôs hard to date when you‚Äôre not sure if your partners are seeing the real you.', 'i think i understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. you‚Äôre probably right. maybe you were treated ‚Äúlike a girl‚Äù in order for your partner to feel more masculine/sapphic. that‚Äôs unfair, since you want them to respect your gender and pronouns like you respect theirs.\nthis problem may not be very common, but i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not the only one. being genderqueer isn‚Äôt even easy with other genderqueer people. i hope i could help, take care!', 'I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt date binary people bc as a nonbinary person who does not like to be put into the binary I‚Äôve not had the best experience with that, my luck has generally been better with nonbinary people but also I‚Äôm fine limiting my dating pool to that extent, I know not everyone is', ""Yeah I've had that happen before. Hilariously enough it's the cis man that respects me more than that particular ex."", 'I find these assumptions really problematic:\n\n> T4T/ Nb4Nb/ T4Nb is supposed to be a safe dynamic for nb and trans ppl\n\nIt\'s like, yes, on average, another trans or nonbinary person is more likely to more easily understand my experience of gender, and respect my gender identity, than the average cis person. But when it comes to specific people, they are all over the map. There are plenty of safe cis people and plenty of unsafe trans and nb people.\n\nI\'m currently in a relationship with a cis woman and like...she totally gets my experience of gender. Like I have had *zero* gender-related tension with her. I also have had both cis women and cis men as friends who really understand my experience of gender and respect my gender identity.\n\nI also dated a nonbinary person before my current partner, and there were some weird gender dynamics with them. In particularly, I found they were very much wanting me to fulfill certain stereotypically ""male"" roles in the relationship, and they seemed to have some major problems with ways I ""acted more female"", i.e. patterns of me dealing with stress and emotions. (I am AMAB and transfeminine.) And in many respects the problems I ran into reminded me a lot of problems I had when trying to date cis women who grew up in more conservative, gender-normative subtext, back when I was living as male. So in this new relationship while my partner was careful not to misgender me, I found that there was some gender-related tension in deeper ways that actually caused more tension and stress than misgendering. Like I felt like there were some ways in which they were expecting our relationship to be more like a gay male-male relationship or straight relationship with me in the male role, instead of letting it be more fluid.\n\nAnother, perhaps worse example, is that I\'ve had some really awful transphobia directed at me from some trans people who think I am ""not really trans"" because of certain personal choices I make, and in some cases I have even met binary trans people who categorically deny the validity of nonbinary identities. And like, not only will these people sometimes explicitly misgender me, but they will go very deep into their assigning of all sorts of analysis and intent to my behavior and choices on the basis of me being ""male"" or being a ""man"". Very toxic.\n\nSo basically, you need to approach this stuff as an individual. Get to know people, see how they interact with you, talk about gender a lot. For me the ""green flags"" are that the person seems not to take gender too seriously.\n\nLike my partner now? Yeah, she is a cis woman but sometimes when we go out she dresses more masc than me. She belches loudly and comments on women she thinks look sexy and sometimes I make fun of her for being the ""dudebro"" in the relationship. So I guess there is a sense in which she is GNC even if she is cis in that she still identifies as a woman. Other times though, she\'s wearing a dress and I\'m wearing pants literally. I know she finds me equally attractive regardless of how I present and I feel more-or-less similar about her. We both find gender silly and fun, at its best, and annoying and cumbersome at its worst, so I think we\'re on the same page about how we approach gender and that is more important than the specifics of our gender identity, the fact that I\'m nb and trans and she is not.', ""i literally had this with everyone until i started dating my wife (she's bisexual and my gender makes no difference to her identity lol) and thought it was somehow something i was doing üò¨""]"
139,roleplay vs gender identity?,"Im afab and im questioning gender. I feel pretty uncomfortable being seen as a woman most of the time as it gives me dysphoria. Other terms associated with being a woman like lady, madam etc make me uncomfortable as well as she/her pronouns.
Masculine/neutral terms make me the happiest as well as being seen as anything other than my agab. Binding my chest and seeing a masc/androgyne person in the mirror makes me really happy. Someone using he/him pronouns make my day. Im not sure what exactly I am, so im thinking of just genderqueer. But there is one thing that confuses me. Sometimes I really like the idea of roleplaying as a feminine/girl-ish person. I didnt knew that this meant so I tried to dress like a girl to see if my gender perhaps changed (maybe that would mean im genderfluid?) but then, dysphoria hitted me again, so I'd never actually do smth with it. I only like it when I know its disconnected from my actual self, like roleplaying as an OC. It feels like im performing but in an enjoyable way. 

Or does this perhaps mean im bigender/genderfluid? Or am I just a cis girl? Or something else?

From intimate communication with my partner to getting the mail or mowing the lawn, the woman/girl version was better  There are cases where being a guy felt correct but only as costume or role play. Almost a vacation from my more ordinary woman self. In fact it was even better than when I thought I was cis man because I took it off when done. We don\'t have to be only one way all the time.

I like that I don\'t have to ""figure it out"". There are so many ways to be a person that don\'t fall into the binary and I feel like genderqueer lets me say that I don\'t fit neatly into those gender boxes. Maybe you feel similarly. Or maybe multiple words feel right to you. I think you can use whatever feels right and that can change over time. We use words to describe our reality at any given moment so if your reality changes, use different words.

142,Shame around gender roles. (rant),"I am a proud young woman, a feminist. My pride around womanhood has blossomed after learning about revolutionary speakers and writers E. Goldman, A. Davis and the like. They give me hope, that a woman can be respected and followed by masses, including men. 

I feel this thirst for action. I want to do and to create with my hands. I‚Äôve thought about joining a trade school, to learn woodworking or welding or smithing or anything. I want to build admirable physical strength. I want to be respected by my family and friends for such skills and qualities. Yet I‚Äôve not made progress in putting those thoughts in the real world.

143,It makes me mad that no one will ever assume the right gender for me,"I've just sort of realized that no one will ever gender me correctly. To set the stage, I'm afab genderqueer and I use they/he pronouns. I also dress very much ""like a girl"" and have no desire to change that. Despite that there's still a complicated mess of me having bottom dysphoria that is on my mind every day as well as some amounts of chest dysphoria. I have a packer I only wear when I'm alone and I only wear a binder with certain outfits. People I'm close to and online know my actual pronouns but to people irl I use any pronouns or she/her pronouns depending who they are. People rarely reach to use he/him pronouns for me even though I've told people to. 

What I really want is 1. bottom growth 2. for people to perceive me without thinking of my gender. I don't want to go on T because I literally don't want any of the effect except for bottom growth and I would be uncomfortable with any other changes, so there's not really hope there. I dress very girly so people always think of me as a girl unless I tell them otherwise and I'm terrible at coming out to people because I always feel awkward and that I'm confusing them by using pronouns they don't necessarily expect from someone who looks like me. And 80% of the time I do come out people either still use she/her for me, or pointedly never use he/him. I wish I enjoyed dressing more androgynously because I think that could help a tiny bit in getting people to use pronouns other than she/her for me, but I really dislike masculine clothing for the most part and it feels very not me. 

I don't even really understand my own gender because it wiggles around some, but I wish people would respect my genderqueerness more. I don't really have people to talk about this all with which definitely doesn't help with the dysphoria and discomfort and the general feeling that everyone is seeing me as a fraud and thinks that I'm actually a girl.

More good news is that as a afab you have the most opportunity ever to be yourself and the first step is to not wait for others to gender you correctly.  Gender is something we feel, but by our appearance we get classified as a gender instantly by people- and for most people gender classifications are deeply entrenched.

Wanting to act masculine or wear traditionally masculine clothes doesn't mean that you have to define as a boy.

147,New to gender exploration,Recently I was trying to explore my gender after finally acknowledging my desire to express myself masculine.  I was happy for the longest time expressing masculine and I noticed whenever my hair got to long I got really insecure so I kept it short. However I cut it shorter this time and since then I have realized I have a desire to be more feminine. Its like my masculine desire has gone into hiding and I feel sort of panicked by this change. Can someone offer me advice... :/ I have had a similar experience with bi-cycles (I am bisexual) and am now wondering if its a similar experience with gender. If its just fluid and I have to accept it,zuiepb,24,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/zuiepb/new_to_gender_exploration/,"['It could be, being gender fluid is a thing.

It is not an all or nothing thing for us, while society acts as if people have to be all one or another it just isn't that way for us.\n\nBecasue appearance is such a signal and messaging, we are also uncomfortable with looking so much like one that people have a harder time when we are the other. My view on that is that it is simplest to not worry about that part- the most important part is to try to be genuine as a person, which is not gendered, and that helps other people get by our cross genderness more easily. \n\nSame situation with sexuality- and bi cycles are just what they are- the practical problem is that we have to choose one anatomy and gender for a monogamous partnering- but really that is not more difficult than finding a good partner in the first place."", 'I‚Äôm a big proponent of self-acceptance.

148,I don't know if/how to come out,"I've known I'm not cis since high school (over 7 years ago) but it's only really been in the last year or so that I feel like I found a label that fits me.

My main issue is that I don't know if I should come out. It's not that it would be unsafe for me to do so, and I'm very lucky to have a family that would always support me, but I just don't feel like I'm trans enough to come out. Even using the word trans for myself makes me uncomfortable, I feel like I'm co-opting it or something from people who are actually trans.

I'm AFAB present fairly feminine so people tend to perceive me as a woman. I'm fine being described as female or when people use she/her pronouns for me but calling me a woman makes me feel sick.

Part of me feels like I'm lying when I don't correct my friends and tell them the truth, but at the same time I'm afraid that I'm actually ""faking it"" or just going along with the ""trend"". Still, I feel so much more myself when people refer to me with they/them.

I would guess that this is fear of non-binary erasure because you\'re not a binary trans person.\n\nAll of this is focussing on the wrong thing. What do *you* think? What would it do for you to be honest with people? How might your life change if you were to live it authentically as yourself?\n\nDo you know for sure of at least one person who will be supportive?

149,"Why won‚Äôt she just talk to me about it? I know I need to put my big boy panties on and talk to her but I‚Äôm scared, and anxious, and terrified, and emotional, and want to cry.","It‚Äôs been a 10 year struggle after I opened up to my wife about my not so fully male self, with me being the one usually giving in on most things. I first opened up to her about just my desire to wear panties, to which she said wasn‚Äôt an issue for her as long as mine weren‚Äôt cuter than hers and I don‚Äôt wear hers. That ended up killing our sex life and even when we had sex I could tell she was just doing it for maintenance. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt intimate anymore. 

I stopped wearing and it really didn‚Äôt get better and I was very depressed. I started wearing again, for my own happiness, but hid them from her. I still wore them around her but she never saw them. If she ever felt them during sex she would say ‚Äúremove those‚Äù or ‚Äúget those out of my way‚Äù. They were hidden in my closet, kinda ironic, and I always washed them while she was at work. On vacation they were always hidden in my laptop bag. Sometimes I would stop wearing because it was depressing realizing I was hiding it again. 

Yesterday I did laundry and have always done well making sure I never dropped any or left a pair in the dryer. This morning she woke up before me and started some other laundry. She found a pair in the washer so she dried them and put them on our dresser.  She said that she found a pair of my undies so she dried them and put them on the dresser. This was with my kids sitting in the room next to us so it wasn‚Äôt a time to discuss it. 

I haven‚Äôt worn for the last few days because of the whole keeping it hidden depresses me part. She has to know something has been different since the last few days she‚Äôs actually seen me putting on underwear and changing in front of her. If I‚Äôm wearing panties I won‚Äôt change or get dressed in front of her.

150,Not sure what to do?,"Hi! Sorry this is such a long story. I‚Äôm having a gender crisis but trying to turn it into a gender adventure lol

So I‚Äôm AFAB. As a kid I dressed as a total tomboy and got mistaken for a boy a lot, I felt really jealous of what boys got to wear and their toys. My mom was obsessed with me being her little twin and putting me in dresses and skirts which I always hated. Literally had screaming fights over it basically every week before church. My hometown was super old school (read: backwards) and I always felt like something was wrong with me for not being ‚Äúgirl enough‚Äù or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I was also born with a defect in my reproductive parts so I felt even less girly/valid as a girl because I didn‚Äôt menstruate and couldn‚Äôt have kids, and didn‚Äôt have any boobs. They put me on hormones when I was 12 because my tits just weren‚Äôt big enough, then offered me a boob job at 16, pretty messed up tbh lol. Basically my hometown saw women‚Äôs role as being pleasing for the male gaze and for making babies so I was the worst young woman around. 

Fast forward and I went to college, could dress how I wanted, and could start trying to unlearn some of the messed up things I had been taught (not easy). I even gained a lot of beer weight one year which went right to my butt and boobs so I finally got hit on by guys and thought I was all good now aside from making babies lol. 

I then moved somewhere even more accepting and within a year realized oh shit I‚Äôm gay that makes a lot of sense. I accepted it fairly easily and thought that‚Äôd be it. I stopped wearing makeup and (mostly) dressed how I wanted to, but making sure you could still tell I had boobs and a little curve. Decided I would never wear a dress again and bought a suit and tie for a wedding and never went back. But when I got my hair cut in a pixie cut people started calling me ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù and ‚Äúguy‚Äù again and I was like shoot I‚Äôm not acting girl enough again how embarrassing what do I do?!

Years later I still have short hair, and still basically dress how I want to, but I hit an age (mid 30s) and my body started getting more curvy again and this time I‚Äôm like WAIT. STOP. For a year I‚Äôve been feeling uneasy when I get called a woman, and my body feels just kind of foreign to me like it‚Äôs not what I want to see. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like my body‚Äôs appearance it‚Äôs just I‚Äôd like parts of it on someone else better maybe? Sometimes I‚Äôll also see a girl and think ‚Äúahh I wish I was a girl‚Äù but I‚Äôve had EVERY opportunity to be one so wtf is that about?? Lol

Anyway all this long story to say: does anyone have any advice on how to proceed? How to explore possible gender identities more? It‚Äôs honestly been so anxiety-inducing! The second I acknowledged the possibility I can‚Äôt get it out of my head. I‚Äôm having trouble with mirrors which I had a lot as a kid too. I can also confidently say now that these feelings are not a product of any internalized misogyny, limiting views on what a woman should/could be, etc as I‚Äôve worked through all that.",zt4we9,20,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/zt4we9/not_sure_what_to_do/,"['It sounds like you‚Äôve been doing all the right things on your journey through life.

Fortunately these days, being somewhere in the middle is becoming a lot more prevalent than it was. Though people are still really attached to gender norms and it being a binary choice.

I should emphasize that said crisis had many causes; I didn\'t transition just because I thought I had a ""man\'s body"".  But now I\'m on T, and I feel great.  I think part of my problem before was that I couldn\'t avoid seeing myself as a woman, even if my body looked masculine; noticing the masculine features I did have was like rubbing salt in a wound, hence my attempts to disguise it with excessive femininity.  Now making my body and presentation less feminine has put my insides and outsides in better harmony, and the ""do I want to be more or less woman?"" question has all but disappeared.\n\nNo guarantee that\'s what you need, though.  I suggest experimenting as much as you can with clothes, styles, hair, pronouns, and whatever else you want.  That will show you more about what feels good for you!', '""Woman"" in the sense of the western binary is a rigid term, a dualistic term, one that usually means pretty, thin, and white, etc. Is that the standard you want to live up to? I don\'t think so, but it\'s useful to keep in mind that society is actively a piece of shit.\n\nWhat can you do to combat that? Well, obviously, no matter what you look like on the outside, your internal experiences matter. And how you wish to act upon the material world based on your experience, is ultimately up to you. Each of us experience gender in ways that can be very different, and there is a lot of room for us to become the gender role that comes from the complexity of our lives. So it is both important to honor your lived experiences, and others who say they are the gender they are -- to combat colonialism and capitalism (the cisheterosexists) \n\nAnyways, I\'m sorry you are having this struggle and I hope you can get some clarity into who you are <3 you are valid!', ""This comes down to how comfortable you are with being called a woman or using she/her pronouns, your gender is not to be decided by other people, it is yours. Of course, you could be a woman (or partially) because being larger than other women or having short hair doesn't make you less of a woman, or less beautiful. If you feel like you are not, you need to think, would you like if people perceived you as something other than a woman? Do you want your short hair to be a sign that you are masculine, and not a woman? (Although, of course, you can be a masculine woman) I wish you the best in figuring yourself out ‚ù§""]"

158,Mix of questioning gender and small rant on feminism,"Hey! 

I‚Äôm afab and I‚Äôve gone through the labels non-binary and demigirl and thought about non-binary woman but haven‚Äôt researched it enough, and lately just woman because.. idk. 

I‚Äôve never felt a kinship with really cis straight ultra feminine women. My sister is like that and she basically tried to make me be like her in my early teens and i‚Äôve always felt out of place in the role like the one she tried to make me fit in. 

Also i used to go to church (long story short), and i used to hate trying to be so traditionally girly and it made me feel super uncomfortable. 

However i know that womanhood can look and feel different ways. So, what if this whole questioning of mine is because the role of being a woman is so customized for the male gaze throughout history. And i‚Äôm bisexual, or a lesbian, idk. Gay in some way. So maybe that‚Äôs why it all feels weird? 

And also just the oppression of women. I often do things to try to revolt against that in small ways. Like play chess with old dudes to kinda make the statement that i‚Äôm just as justified and capable in doing that, get involved in ‚Äùintellectual‚Äù type of things partly because i genuinely enjoy it but also partly to get the satisfaction of challenging a know-it-all-mansplaining-guy in a debate, and just generally take up space where i‚Äôm not expected to. Because i often think ‚Äùjust because i‚Äôm a woman i‚Äôm not supposed to do this?? Why? I can do whatever i want?!‚Äù And it just makes me furious lol 

I think for me it‚Äôs mostly the intellectual part; thinking and talking and learning about politics, filosophy, psychology, niche kinds of music, art movies etc. Like i don‚Äôt understand why that‚Äôs supposed to have anything to do with gender. But i feel like it‚Äôs expected that it‚Äôs the dudes‚Äô area? It just makes me mad!!! Lol 

Nonbinary? Woman? Feminist? Or everything all at once? Perhaps nobody knows.

But idk if anyone has anything to enlighten me with regarding this or someone who can just understand or something that‚Äôd be nice",zpsmen,14,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/zpsmen/mix_of_questioning_gender_and_small_rant_on/,"['I 100% understand you. It‚Äôs like you wrote my brain out in this post. I go by she/they pronouns and think in my head that I‚Äôm most likely a non binary woman but its so hard to label all the feelings that I‚Äôm feeling. I feel so strongly about defending women and working towards furthering our rights and I love subverting gender norms like its my job. I also love playing into gender norms to keep people on their toes. Really the only thing I want it to be respected. Isn‚Äôt that what we all want? To be accepted and loved and to fully express ourselves however we want in any given moment? I just want to be happy and exist in this world without being bothered by men or misogynists.

Being girly, liking chess and debate, all that stuff, that‚Äôs that mucus (why did I pick this analogy? Ick.) but gender identity is that tiny little piece of grit in the middle. There are associations between them, but they don‚Äôt determine each other. There‚Äôs no rule that says you have to be something other than a woman if you like stereotypically ‚Äúunwomanly‚Äù things. It‚Äôs no more indicative of your gender identity than whether you wear skirts or jeans or whatever.\n\nI‚Äôd also say that all at once is definitely a possibility. Feminist, non binary and woman aren‚Äôt contradictory things, that‚Äôs fairly close to how I‚Äôd define myself tbh‚Ä¶ sort of. Feminist and non binary at least‚Ä¶ woman is more at arms length. I can touch it if I stretch and lean.  \nAnyway, you definitely sound like feminist would work, though only you can tell you if you‚Äôre a woman or non binary.\n\nI hope this is something like what you‚Äôre looking for? The problem with talking about gender is there is an awful lot of metaphor involved because the language we‚Äôve got for it is woefully undeveloped for some reason in our patriarchal societies.', ""We're just people who should be allowed to have interests.

159,Surprised by breastforms,"Hi friends - hoping to hear if anyone can relate to my experience last weekend!

So I went out shopping wearing breastforms for the first time last weekend.   Nothing too dramatic - b cup.   Well I felt very comfortable with them, and grew to like looking down at my chest, and seeing them there.   In fact I was very sad to take them out.   

This really surprised me - I know that I love wearing skirts and dresses and pretty shoes but I hadn‚Äôt expected to get sooo attached to the breast forms.   They really just felt like they belonged.     

I‚Äôve not experienced any body dysphoria previously and until now I‚Äôve only really thought this is about my gender presentation rather than identity.   

Can anyone relate to this?   Does it sound like a step towards a more fundamental change perhaps, ie full transition?

160,Advice on telling my partner I'm questioning my gender identity.,"I'm AMAB and have been trying to figure out my gender identity for quite some time.

Recently my partner (AFAB and cis as far as I know) and I have been working through some pretty make life changes (immediate family passing, moving out of state) and with that my gender questioning has one again pushed itself full force into my daily thoughts.

164,Can I be agender?,"&#x200B;

So, hi. I've already asked this question on another subreddit but I want to get some more info/opinions. I've been figuring my gender identity out lately. I've come to a conclusion that I don't really feel like a woman or like a man. I think, however, that I'm a bit attached to feminity/masculinity so I've been using nonbinary for a while now. The problem is, I don't think that it really depicts my feelings and identity. I don't think that  this term is entirely right for me. Could I be agender? What other terms could fit?

166,Gender fluid and enjoying different hobbies when feeling more fem/masc,"Hi everyone, I was really curious to know if others feel like their hobbies change alongside with their feeling of gender?

Im gender fluid I guess. So i can feel more femme or masc on certain days but its usually more like months at a time. But also the things I enjoy doing changes too. 

I have a big sweet tooth and love to bake. I‚Äôll make all kinds of desserts for a couple of weeks. Its times like that that I feel more feminine. 

On the other hand, I also enjoy working out. I was exercising pretty consistently for a while and one of the things that made me so happy was actually gaining some muscle and feeling strong! It felt very affirming, to feel more masculine and right in a way.

168,What is it called when someone refers to you by the wrong honorific or term ?,"I was unfortunately referred to as a ""Mr"" by my psychiatrist in a recent document (when I have told him multiple times already that I am genderqueer and only accept being referred to as Mx, even if I use he/they pronouns). Is that also called misgendering ?

I know technically is, but what I mean is if there's a more specific term to express that someone referred to you by the wrong honorific or term (or at least something you're not comfortable with) - like ""dude"", or ""sis"".

Edit:  I can't seem to reply to u/otterscotch, but as I mentioned above, this wasn't about a form section, this was about my personal psychiatrist - who I've known for months and who I've told and corrected multiple times about my gender identity - misegendering me in a personalized document he issued on my request. He didn't just refer to me as ""Mr."" in the greetings section, he made sure to do it throughout the whole body of text.

170,dating advice for the queer closet,"Hi! I need some advice on dating but I don't think people irl can get it.

I'm 22 and ever since I came out as trans (gender queer) I've only dated queer people who already knew about my preferred name and pronouns and are on the LGBT+ community themselves. That's made things easier and they've all respected my identity well enough so that it wouldn't be an issue. 

My problem is that a guy from school asked me out. I go to uni and I'm halfway through my career, but I'm very much not 'out' there. I came to terms with my gender a few months before starting my career, I didn't have a preferred name yet and my family was not the most supportive so I didn't say anything about it at first, then when people (classmates and teachers) made nasty comments about queer identities I chose to keep mine private to avoid any discrimination and ostracizing I may face.

Now it's a few months later and I have a chosen name and use all pronouns, things at home are less hectic and I have made some friends at school, but I'm still not out to anyone there. I don't want to have this be an issue with the institution and I don't want to keep coming out over and over again, plus I'm a year and a half away from graduating. My plan was to tell the people I'm closest with once I have my degree so that if anything goes wrong it won't be at the cost of my education. 

However, I made this plan when I had cero thoughts of going out with anyone there. If I'm honest I'm not actually looking to date someone right now but I was thinking of giving this guy a shot at a date because, if anything, a cool friendship could come out of this.

Problem no. 2 is that I'm not comfortable with starting a potential romantic relationship without being honest about who I am, but I'm also considering the risk of literally anyone there finding out and telling more people. I'm not ashamed of who I am and if anyone asked I'd be honest about it, but I don't want my coming out to be out of my control.

It'd be great to hear other queer people's experience in dating and coming out, even if you have wildly different stories I'd like to have a wider perspective on this.

171,Nonbinary as a political identity,"Disclaimer: I am a 24 year old cis bisexual with a handful of nonbinary and trans friends who understand my thinking but don't feel their experiences can speak to my ideas

I'm a high femme cis woman who's relatively comfortable in that identity, and everything about my outward appearance and gender performance confirms this. I also think gender, as a performance, has too much weight placed on it in the current political and social climate a lot of us live in.
I remember learning about political lesbianism in an English class in college, and a brief discussion about political gender identities had been brought up in bad faith from another student. But I think the concept has some merit, and as the discussions of gender and identity continue to evolve, it feels more and more reasonable for a nonbinary identity to be lived in in a similar way as political lesbianism. 
That being said, I also think about and worry frequently that because of how I present, and exist in my gender performance, that something that, to me, feels as simple as shifting pronouns and rejecting a sense of obligation to the binary, could be seen as offensive or dismissive of the real struggles of nonbinary and gender queer people, and possibly give them a ""bad look.""

I'm not going through this thought experiment to ""be special,"" I do that enough without gender. I'm going through it because I genuinely think it's a discussion worth thinking about, and a lot of reading I can do online often feels as though it's in bad faith.

Any thoughts appreciated!",zmxtl9,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/zmxtl9/nonbinary_as_a_political_identity/,"['I mean, if you are living as a nonbinary person, and it makes you comfortable with yourself and makes you feel more like ""you"", then I\'d say you have a right to identify as such.

One of my first queer friends said they identified as nonbinary for ""political reasons"", and they\'re still very proudly queer. I\'d imagine their understanding of their queerness changed over the years, because that\'s what coming out tends to do. I\'d say go for it. Worst case scenario you find out it\'s not for you. It doesn\'t sound to me like you\'re ""choosing"" to be nonbinary. It sounds to me like you\'ve put a lot of thought into this and are ready to figure some things out.

172,face app triggered gender curiosity,"Hi,

I was searching for similar experiences as I've had a curious experience triggered by Face Apps gender swap feature. I'm a guy. 

I have had some earlier thoughts in my life, trying to imagine myself as a girl, imagining sex as a female, etc. 

To be honest I don't think I have dysphoria or euphoria as such, as I'm fairly comfortable in my cis gender. I have a wife and a son, although I may have a bit more of a motherly take on parenting than my wife actually does. But I'm happy in my life and I love and am attracted to my wife. 

Funnily enough it turns out that I dressed up as Madeleine from North and South, and my wife dressed up as Orry, so maybe we fit like that.

I tried face apps gender swap filter and frankly have been a little obsessed with the result afterwards. I don't want to transition or anything like that, but I have been mentally running through what the female me would go through during the days I've had at work. How would she interact with her colleagues? How would she be as a mother? What would her romantic life be like? Would she have developed the same interests as male me? Almost as if I'm running a parallel universe in my head, living the female life as a sort of what if scenario. The thoughts are paired with a vague sense of melancholy though. I like the thought and know it is impossible. 

Honestly, female me is pretty beautiful imo. I'm not sure if this feeds some of my reaction. 

Not sure if this puts me anywhere on the spectrum, but I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on the matter.",zmu8dx,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/zmu8dx/face_app_triggered_gender_curiosity/,[]

178,"Came out as genderqueer, but curious if I'm also trans?","So like many folks, I've (AMAB, 25) been wrestling quite a bit with my gender identity since the beginning of the pandemic. In 2020, I started experimenting with makeup and feminizing my wardrobe. In 2021, I decided to change my pronouns to he/they and a few months ago, I fully embraced the label ""genderqueer"" (I've begun getting used to ""nonbinary"" and ""genderfluid"" as well). However, lately, I've been getting a feeling I could be trans too. I say this because I've been finding myself becoming more and more entranced by femininity, especially in seeing pictures of gorgeous women wearing beautiful outfits and wishing I could be them *and* be with them (a classic queer predicament). I've been buying dresses and skirts and have only worn them in the privacy of my own home (except when I wore a really cute black solid knit slit midi dress for my Halloween costume). I've been reading and researching more and more about transness. I keep getting and watching gender/HRT journey videos on my Tik Tok feed (the algorithm is listening to my anxieties, methinks). I started seriously pondering taking estrogen and find myself constantly transforming selfies on FaceApp to make me look like a woman. I know, personal data, but I really do love the way I look as a woman.

The problem is... I still am very comfortable and happy with my masculinity. I like the way my body looks and I like being hairy and having a mustache and beard. I'm not too bothered by male signifiers (although sometimes being called ""sir"" in a certain tone can be a little triggering lol). I also have a very loving partner with whom I've discussed these feelings and she is very supportive of my gender journey. I've talked about it in therapy too, but I still keep hitting a wall in terms of what to do and where to go. I know gender is a spectrum and I love being able to embrace the gray spaces between my masculine side and feminine side. But I'm also really struggling with my dysphoria and am worried (and maybe secretly a little excited) about what estrogen will change about me. I'm also anxious about how it will affect my sex drive, the actual monetary cost of it, and the impact it will have on other people in my life. As excited as I am about the gain of exploring more depths of my gender, I'm worried about losing a part of myself that I still want to hold onto. Part of me wishes I could just oscillate between both at the same time, that I can look the way I look now and also look like a woman whenever.

179,Weird Dyphoria Vent,"ok so am 23 amab person. I feel sorta agender leaning. I got referred to as ""she"", a few months ago, as I was growing my hair out + am just physically smaller framed, and felt nothing different than being called he or they. I like being called they a little bit more but not a lot.

However, I do like the comfort and invisibility that comes with being a guy. I also the social dynamic, my strength. When I think about being an old man and living the rest of my life as a man I feel happy. I also like my body. For the most part.

I experience what I think is extreme bottom dysphoria. I constantly think about having the opposite equipment of what I have. I don't think about any other aspect of being an afab person.

Its gotten very bad actually. I am incredibly lonely. I want to be intimate with people, but I can't, I feel just very awfully extreme disgust. I thought it would go away by now but it just keeps getting worst. I cannot even masterbate really. I haven't been intimate with another person when since I was 20. I feel disgusting or like I am broken. Idk if there is an option for me to fix this other than like, pretend to be a trans woman, lie essentially, and get the surgery I want.

I just thought id post this since I sorta searched the internet and could only find a AFAB person with sorta the same feelings as me but reversed obviously. So yeah. Still not sure what I am going to do.

180,Is there a word for this?,"Hi everyone,

I am trying to find a word for the way I feel. I am asexual and a cisgender woman, but there is something I can't articulate succinctly. I do identify as a woman (although honestly I don't feel that strongly about it), use she/her pronouns, etc. I am fine with my gender (social) identity. But I have dysphoria around my female genitals. Breasts are fine, but if I could just have a Barbie/Ken doll situation between my legs that would be great. I **definitely** do not feel the desire to have male genitals. The ideal would be nothing.

181,it's been 2 years and i'm still going back and forth on my identity + wanting top surgery,"this summer, i was finally making breakthroughs. i cut my hair, used new pronouns at my summer job, journaled about my gender and decided that i wanted top surgery. 

this made everything feel real after 2 years of useless ruminating, and flip-flopping between top surgery or a reduction.

but it didn't last, i physically can't say ""i'm non binary/genderfluid/not cis"" bc nothing feels right. i keep putting any pronouns in my bio and deleting it. most of my friends don't know. 

i haven't even contacted a surgeon, but what if i'm rushing into top surgery? i'm in the uk so either i wait 2 years to get referred, or go to a decent surgeon in spain sooner, but i don't like all of his scar shapes. plus idk how i'd hide recovery + a flat chest from my family.

i constantly wish my chest was flat in clothes, but i can't picture my bare chest flat even though i HATE having boobs. binding doesn't help bc they're too big.

how does anyone figure this out? i know everyone has their own pace but i'm scared that the world will end before i've done anything lol. there's so much indecisiveness and self-sabotage that i can't tell what's my true thoughts and what's terf island talking",zhwl30,28,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/zhwl30/its_been_2_years_and_im_still_going_back_and/,"['Honestly, it sounds like you really want top surgery. You don\'t have to pick an identity to get a procedure done that will make you more comfortable in your body. It sounds like your reasoning for not wanting to do it boils down to ""it will be hard to hide from my family"" mixed with a bit of ""what if I regret it later?"" I empathize with these sentiments in regards to taking T and also further transition moves. But if you hate having boobs and want top surgery, I\'d say go for it. Don\'t settle for the surgeon whose scars you don\'t like. It\'s the same as a tattoo but even more important. These will be your results for life, so pick a surgeon you\'d be happy with and then spend the wait time making sure you really do want this. But in my opinion it sounds like you do. You can always cancel if not though! No one is able to force you into anything, but you only have one life and don\'t you want to spend it being comfortable? Figuring out your identity can come later. Genderfluid is actually pretty likely if you can\'t nail a solid identity down. I mostly identify as male but sometimes float closer to the genderless side of the spectrum. Good luck!', 'I\'m genderfluid too and I struggled for a bit on whether to get surgery.

I can\'t promise it will be the same for you though, everyone is different. \n\nIf you are interested in top surgery but not hormones, it might help to look at some examples of those results to think about how you would feel if that was you. You can also look at people that have gotten reductions too. I\'ve had several friends get surgery with no hormones, hormones and no surgery, both, and neither. All are valid it just depends what feels right to you. If it helps keep a journal where you answer every day ""if I could press a button and change my body for the day,  with no repercussions from others, what combination of characteristics would I want?"" After answering it for a few weeks see if you see a trend. I discovered that some days I wanted my breasts gone and some days I was fine with them, but I was never really excited about having them. If you\'re ambivalent about having them on some days you\'d probably be ambivalent on them being gone too.\n\nThe question about other people is what comes next. How do you think your friends and family would react if you came out to them? Are there new friends you can make that are trans affirming that you can be out to? It helps a lot to have a support network through this process. If you decide you want a reduction you probably don\'t have to come out to explain that, you can just say you had back pain. If you get a flat chest it\'s probably harder to hide it without coming out', 'no matter what, you‚Äôre allowed to want top surgery, & to not want top surgery. you‚Äôre allowed to get it, & you‚Äôre allowed to not get it. being not cis, or being gender non-conforming, or being anything doesn‚Äôt mean that you automatically have to get it, you‚Äôre valid if you don‚Äôt - but you also absolutely deserve it if that‚Äôs what you want. your body is yours, fuck the haters. whatever feels right will come to you, i promise. üíö', 'It sounds like you‚Äôre consider a similar middle ground to me. Mine are too big and dense to bind. If i get just a reduction done, i can get them small enough to bind, and also have them on days when I‚Äôm feeling more the fem side of myself.

182,I never needed a title before,"Hi folks
I am a Cis gender female. Mom of 3. Female wife to a male husband. I never questioned these titles before. As a child I was a ""tom boy,"" a term I now find insulting.

 In spite of all my worldly titles, I have never fit the stereotype of ""girl"" or ""woman."" Since becoming a mom, however, I've embraced my femininity and feminine self- I created life and birthed 3 humans. I am proud of the things my body can do in the way it was formed. 

But...
I think the binary culture I exist in is bull shit.  

Onto the next adventure...I've recently embarked on an ENM relationship. As I am learning more about and falling into somewhat of a rhythm with my partner, I'm seeing he has many of the gender fluid (traditionally female/submissive) characteristics my husband has. Both of these men (one a contractor one a chef) make me happy and feel complete and attractive for who/what I am. 

I love and support my non binary, Trans, homosexual friends. And I don't want to draw attention towards myself in the quest for better cultural acceptance of ""non traditional"" folks. But I also feel like I want my community to know that I'm different too. 

Is this crazy? 
I just read a post about a Cis person questioning and leading back to Cis. Maybe that is me too? 
Just because I want to be the big spoon and my partners want to be the little spoon doesn't change my gender identity (a silly example among the dozens of  non traditional relationship roles). But maybe my gender identity is ready for a re evaluation? 

I don't know who to ask in real life, so I'm opening up to you, this community, because many of your posts are so welcoming and helpful.

It's like normal cis, but with added security."", 'hey, non-binary person here! i‚Äôm trying to answer your question with my experience:\nno, it doesn‚Äôt. it could be an indicator, but there‚Äôs a lot more to figuring your gender out than that. it‚Äôs great that you did research about gender identities and thought about it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre genderqueer yourself. as you probably know, you could be, but you don‚Äôt have to. gender identities are a very interesting topic and getting to know yourself and your gender is always complicated, even if you‚Äôre cis. \ni hope you can figure this out for and be kind to yourself!', ""You might still be cis, as the others have said. \n\nBefore I was able to get a good handle on my anxiety I had an obsessive several years of gender questioning- it was one of the compulsive thoughts that my anxiety liked to fall into when I was stressed, and I wasn't able to determine the true answer until I had reduced my anxiety. It sounds like you have already become aware of how anxiety can influence your patterns of thought, which is a great thing to know. If I were you I would allow yourself to pause the gender questioning, allow yourself to exist in an unknown state, and tackle the anxiety which might be keeping you stuck in place.\n\nObviously you know your own situation better than me, but this is what helped me out a great deal."", ""TONS of cis people question their gender. And not being girly isn't remotely related to gender. Lots of people are GNC. Probably most, actually. And being GNC is awesome.

But because of my big anxiety i have fallen into a thing called trans-ocd.', 'I\'m in the same boat as you. For a while, I was questioning what it means to be a woman and just because I had that thought, I felt like I wasn\'t because ""cis people don\'t have those questions."" I have a number of friends who have had similar questions and realized they were a different identity, so I must be going through the same thing? Incorrect. I really hate that rhetoric because it limits free thought, and overestimate how confident cis people are in their own identities. Why do we limit people who question their gender, or even sexual, identity just to people who are trans, nonbinary or queer? I do want to emphasize that I don\'t want to downplay or take away from the experience of the aforementioned folks, but to limit such an experience to just those people isn\'t totally fair. It\'s all a journey, and no matter how long it takes to get to where you want to be doesn\'t matter.\n\nIt took me a really long time to realize this because like you it was, and still super is, a huge anxiety point for me. Seeing all the rhetoric about cis people never questioning their own identity, but then not relating to the experiences of people who realized they were a different gender identity than they thought, made me feel super isolated and I had multiple panic attacks because of it. After some more reading, and some conversations with amazing people, I realized that I wasn\'t so alone in this thought. So I do want to say that there is a light at the end of this tunnel.\n\nConducting research is important so you can learn more about other identities, and possibly one that may fit you more than a woman, but if the answer you land is that you\'re a woman, then that\'s perfectly okay. Gender is such a vast and expansive experience and whether you\'re cis or not, it\'s worth taking a look especially if you\'re having all these questions.\n\nLuckily, I have an amazing therapist who has helped me become more comfortable in exploring the facets of my own gender identity without the overarching fear of it not being what I\'m comfortable with.\n\nThe biggest takeaway I\'ve had from my therapist is this. It\'s one thing to realize you aren\'t who you were at birth because you would *want* to do the affirming things to point to/or be seen as your true identity. It\'s when the feeling turns into a *have to* is where it\'s different. ""Oh I HAVE to not be cis because of XYZ"" or ""I HAVE to be X because of Y.""\n\nI would read Female Masculinity by Judith Halberstam if you\'re interested. She does a really interesting deep dive into how gender is such a multi-faceted, ever-consuming experience in western society that it\'s unfair to clump someone\'s question of their own gender identity with them being not the gender they were assigned at birth (while that is the case for many people who are trans/nonbinary and should be respected but she digresses). She also talks a lot about gender as an experience in general and the line between gender-nonconforming expression and actual trans identities. As a forewarn, the language can get kind of eh but it was written in the mid-90s so it was a different time, but her points still stand.\n\nI know this is super long, but if you want any additional advice I would be open to talking about it more.', ""No there is no specific timeline/limit for questioning gender where you cant possibly be cis. It's been 6 years for me and I'm still second guessing myself a lot."", 'the reason that\'s bandided about so often is it\'s a well-intentioned, but ultimately misguided attempt to push people who think they aren\'t ""trans enough"" to do what makes them happy. that\'s ultimately it. would being cis, being the gender you were assigned at birth, make you happy? do you wish you could be another gender? the answers to those questions can take a while to come to. take all the time you need', ""No, it doesn't. And rolling snake eyes 10 times in a row also doesn't mean that a pair of dice must be weighted.\n\nBut.\n\nThey probably are.\n\nEDIT: The initial sentence is in answer to the yes/no question from OP, not being argumentative or contradictory."", 'There‚Äôs actually a term for a cis person who questioned their gender and simply learned for sure that they‚Äôre cis, and it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCis+‚Äù.

When I call myself a woman, I am still aware that I am non-binary and queer. When I hear other people refer to me by feminine titles/nouns, I don't know if they're doing so because they only see me as a cis woman.

No matter how true a term is for me, if there are major misconceptions people hold about it, I\'m unlikely to use the term to communicate with others because it\'s likely to result in miscommunication, and that\'ll either leave them misunderstanding me, or leave me emotionally exhausted, and often both.\n\nI can totally see this coming up with words like ""woman"" or ""man"" too, so what you say makes a lot of sense. Part of it is that a word like ""woman"" means six billion different things in different contexts. As nonbinary people, we inevitably are going to fit some of these definitions but not others.

188,Full of questions about gender identity and expression,"Hello! I'm a 34M and while I spent my early years convinced I was transgender (this was before I knew a word for it) by the time I turned 18, I felt comfortable in my body and realised that what I was reacting to was everybody else's idea of what it was to be male and how little that fitted with me.

I was raised by three women (my mom, aunt, and grandmother) and it probably shows that I didn't have any male influences growing up. I am very softly spoken, much more comfortable around women than men, and usually come over as quite effeminate or (some say) camp.   Straight men always assume I'm gay. I've been pansexual since I was 16 but don't really relate that to my own gender identity.

Visually, I have long curly hair, sometimes wear eye makeup and nail varnish, and try and dress quite nondescript. I nearly always have some kind of bag, which I apparently (and unintentionally!) wear like a handbag, but I don't really see how people can go without a bag. I have a few really nice suits that I like to wear on occasion but that just makes me feel like I'm in fancy dress rather than dressing for my gender.

I'm thinking a lot about this as my 8 year relationship has just ended due to me not being masculine enough. My ex found a traditionally macho guy and figured out that's what she actually likes. She said that to her, I'm a girl. 

This ex is the only female partner I've had who's been straight, so maybe that is a thing, I don't know but it's really making my head spin.

Like I said, I'm comfortable in my body, I just don't adhere to anything that people prescribe as ""male"". I don't think I do that much that's particularly female either, I just avoid the macho-manly-stuff and float around in the ether. I don't feel any attachment to either gender. 

I've seen so many wonderful conversations taking place about gender over the last few years. I don't really understand where I fit into this. I do not feel cis but then I feel like I'm stepping where I shouldn't if I say so. The result of that is feeling really very alone - it would be lovely if someone said ""hey, look, a subreddit for you""

But then, I don\'t necessarily do much that is overtly ""masculine"" either.  I totally resonate with what you say about ""floating around in the ether."" I\'m not very feminine in presentation or dress; I mostly wear jeans and sweatshirts and flannels. I have short hair. I look pretty gay, and I think people read me as a lesbian, and maybe sometimes as ""nonbinary"". (80% of the time folks can tell I am biologically female but sometimes I\'ll get, ""sir"" and I don\'t mind at all, it\'s no bother and it doesn\'t make me feel weird, etc.) But then sometimes I wear hoop earrings, and sometimes I wear mascara, etc.  And it\'s all fine.

I am not a very stereotypical ""woman""- okay! Great! You are not a stereotypically-presenting ""man""- great! It just makes the spectrum wider of what ""man"" and ""woman"" or ""male"" and ""female"" can be. It\'s GOOD, maybe, even, for people to see that you are a male, and have long curly hair and wear nail polish, and I am a female and wear jeans and work boots and buzz the sides of my head.

When people referred to me as a man, I felt like a fraud, and that I was somehow lying to them, and that the person they were referring to wasn\'t the person that I am. When people referred to me as nonbinary, I felt as though I was burdening them with this difficult change, and that I was somehow ""cringey"", but the important thing to note is that I didn\'t feel that way around other trans people, especially other nonbinary people.

191,AGAB expectations and dysphoria,"So, I‚Äôve recently come to terms with a gender fluid identity.  When I identified as a binary gender based on AGAB, I consciously fought certain expectations.  Particularly around social norms re: body hair.  It never bothered me to have hair in places that were considered ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù for AGAB.  

Recently, though (since recognizing GQ / enby identity), that hair is bothering me; essentially it‚Äôs causing dysphoria.

I'm amab and it helps me connect with the feminine side of my identity."", 'Idk what is considered ""normal"", but what you\'re saying makes sense to me. I\'ve only just begun questioning my own identity, so I\'m no kind of expert. But I have experienced something similar. Whether it\'s technically dysphoria, or wanting to be seen in a way that better aligns with how I feel, or simply increased recognition that I don\'t have to force myself to conform to the bullshit social norms of my AGAB, I have no idea.', 'Your identity is as fluid as your personality, I believe this is true for everyone. If getting rid of the hair would make you feel more comfortable in your own skin, do it! It‚Äôll grow back üòä if leaving it alone does that as well, go for it. We never stop growing no matter how old we get, might as well go with the flow. Good luck to you friend ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'I\'ve found that, for me, so much of my relationship to my body is cultural and contextual. So for example, if I choose to wear different clothing, this changes how I feel about my body. Finding clothing that I want to wear, but have trouble finding ones of that fit, can contribute to dysphoria. With body hair, wanting to wear something but having those outfits live within a social context where it is rare to see people wear them with body hair, can create pressure to remove that hair, just as it can cause dissonance the other way around if I\'m wearing an outfit that normally would be associated with certain degrees of body hair and that hair isn\'t present.\n\nAnd it then gets more complex, because sometimes I can take pleasure or comfort in breaking the norms around body shape, hair, or other body characteristics, whereas other times I feel discomfort in looking ""too jarring"". I have my own personal preference of exactly how gender-non-conforming I want to be in a given moment, and it fluctuates based on a lot of things.\n\nAnd of course it\'s influenced by other people. If I see more queer people around me overtly breaking certain norms, sometimes I can feel more comfortable doing so myself. But if I see cis, otherwise-gender-conforming people starting to adopt a new look as a ""trend"", something that used to be previously seen as gender-non-conforming, this can then make it so that if I make that particular choice, it no longer seems to feel as ""gender-non-conforming"" as it used to. Gender is a social construct but it\'s annoying in that the target is always moving, because of fashion trends, which I frankly find very stupid and aggravating.\n\nBut basically....short answer, yes it is completely normal to have a complex relationship to this stuff and I can imagine a long list of ways you might find that the way you feel about this stuff suddenly changes, perhaps as a function of how you think about yourself, perhaps as a function of other presentation choices you make, perhaps as a function of others you are hanging around and/or seeing and getting influenced by, or perhaps for other reasons I haven\'t even thought of!\n\nI find that for me, being aware of all the different influences can help me take my feelings on this stuff with a grain of salt, and thus help me feel less discomfort about it.

192,What's the difference between non-binary and genderqueer identities?,"I've been reading up on non-binary and genderqueer identities, but through my reading I can't seem to really grasp if there's any clear differences between the two.

In particular, my experience as a non-binary person doesn't seem to be all that different from one of a genderqueer person, but I also feel the genderqueer label doesn't quite fit my feelings surrounding my gender. 

So, in your experience, what do you think the differences are? Are the differences significant? Or is there enough overlap that they could be considered to be interchangeable?",zcdxsg,41,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/zcdxsg/whats_the_difference_between_nonbinary_and/,"[""I use both pretty nearly interchangeably but as far as I can tell, genderqueer is a more broad term and it's older"", 'Pretty much up to the individual. Some people use them interchangeably, some prefer one over the other. Language is very fluid.', ""I agree with the folks who say there's no set definition. I learned the term genderqueer in 2009, and it was an awakening for me. Genderqueer to me means that I don't identify as male or female, but I tend to present as more stereotypically one of the binary genders. And I don't care how people perceive my gender. I also use non-binary to describe myself sometimes, only because it appears to be more well-known. \n\nI like the idea of genderqueer being an umbrella term though.

Nonbinary is a simpler, more well known term, so I usually tell cis people or people not familiar with all of that that's my identity.

Its a mixed bag unique even amongst other trans people and for that reason mainly, my gender is queer, and so that is the term I most closely identify with.

193,I have strange feelings about gender,"So I'm an AMAB person on MTF HRT. I can't socially transition yet because of my transphobic family. I really dislike it when they call me a boy or, especially, a man. In forms that ask about gender I choose female, and the male option feels wrong. I like being referred to with she/her pronouns. So far it's all pretty normal transfeminine stuff, but there's another weird thing. I like boys, and when I'm in a romantic relationship it just feels good to think of ourselves as two boys, and being referred to with he/him pronouns feels good too. It's like I'm a feminine male when with a boyfriend, and a female otherwise. I've never heard of such experiences from other people, and maybe I'm just confused, but this is how I feel. About labels, I don't really know what to use to myself, so when asked I just say queer or trans, but also kinda identify with gay (meaning mlm). So this is strange. Not that I feel bad for all this.

197,Self discovery journey continues,"Long venting post. TLDR: felt more femme yesterday than I'm used to. Realizing I may be more genderfluid than I previously thought. 

Had an unexpected experience yesterday. For background I started questioning my gender around 2 1/2 - 3 years ago at 53-54. I've gone from believing I'm cis male to genderqueer, to non-binary since then. Some of that has been influenced by feeling like an imposter and some just by my own understanding of my gender evolving.

Back to yesterday. I had decided to wear some lacy panties because I wanted to feel a bit more girly yesterday. No big deal at that point. I know I have both masculine and feminine traits and I'm usually within a balanced zone. Yesterday just got to the feminine edge of the zone. Well later in the day I got done with work and had some extra me time so I pulled up some porn.

I found myself looking at it from the female actor point of view, which I don't typically do. I imagined being her in the scene rather than the guy with her. I rubbed myself the way if imagine a woman would while staying in the outside of the frilly panties. I went through the whole video like this. And while I didn't orgasm, I felt very satisfied.

I had brushed off the idea of being genderfluid before because it didn't seem to fit. But I'm thinking that might have been me just not recognizing the possibility. I definitely took a hard swing toward the feminine yesterday. I didn't expect that. It was an interesting experience and I enjoyed it.

Now I need to look at my identity again. I'm guessing one of the fluid ones does fit. I present mostly masc-androgynous, in part because I thought of myself as cis male for so long and in part because many aspects of my life would self destruct. I'm also very comfortable in the masc -androgynous space, I've been there most of my life without really thinking about it.

While realizing more recently that I do have feminine aspects in my gender identity and I express them, mostly privately (lots of panty wearing under my clothes). I didn't realize that I could swing so hard to the genuine l feminine side. While I don't think I'm trans femme, I can definitely see exploring this more. Should be interesting and eye opening.

200,This is all new to me. Open to any advice and encouragement.,"Hi all! I'm 35 and have presented as masc my whole life. But I also used to wish for things that ""weren't for me""- dolls, twirly skirts, (don't attack me I know they're evil) and bras are the ones I remember most vividly. I grew up in a deeply conservative sect of nondenominational churches (before non-d was cool) and was taught all the horrible things you might imagine which don't bear repeating. I attend a college run by this group where I experienced some of the worst years of my life. 

All the indoctrination came crashing down around my ears when, at 21, my older brother came out as gay to me. I wasn't surprised per se, as we shared a computer growing up, but I just thought he was curious like me. *This is the part where you all say ""Wash, how did you not put it together pal?""* 

Fast forward a few years and I'm not going to church anymore and am dating a guy. Fast forward a few more years and I'm back in church and more conservative than ever (I think being open with myself scared me and I needed to hide). Married my wife, we have a son, and everything is fairly normal (read: hateful and judgy). I said some things to my brother that were very hurtful.

The summer 2020 we moved to my home town for my job. We had been out of the the church's clutches and we had a bit of an awakening. I made amends with my brother and told him that I have never been more wrong. I told my wife about a particular fetish I have, which didn't go well but we made it through, told her about some other things I like in the bedroom (see my previously mentioned dating history) which did go well. 

I bought some less masc underwear under the guise of ""they're comfy and sexy"". Then she's getting rid of some of hers and jokingly asks if I want them. I say yes, to both of our surprise, and start wearing them regularly as well. We have done a lot of counseling both on personal and couple issues, both gotten on anti-anxiety and adhd meds, and are in a pretty good place. 

We're in our way out the door of religion at this point and the other day, about a week ago it just hits me- I've never really felt comfortable with ""the guys"" 90% of the time. My closest friends are women. None of that means anything. Except. I don't feel like a man. I don't want to physically alter my body, but I also don't want to wear khakis and polos the rest of my life. He/Him doesn't fit. Heels look enticing, and I still want my twirly skirt. I'm tired of people acting like I'm crazy for wanting to sleep with a teddy bear or wear a nightshirt (call it what it is- a gown lol). 

So I'm talking to a friend and she's like ""you know there are options outside of ""cis"" and ""trans"" right?"" Well of course I do. What's your... ooooh. I talked to my wife about it. Went well at first, then not so well, then good again. We are settling in to it, though I know it will take time.  We are monog at least for now, but she asked me point blank if i think I'm bi and I can't feel honest saying no- she knows I dated a guy but that was ""a fling"" right? I think probably not. 

But how happy I am! How free I feel. I went to a discount outlet and dropped $18 on 5 outfits and another 30 on two more and some heeled boots from Amazon. People- I've never felt more myself.

A few questions if anyone has any ideas: 

I hate my hair right now and have never liked haircuts. I thought it was because I couldn't sit still (adhd) but I think it's because I don't like how I look. I feel forced to choose looks that I don't want. Right now it's very ""Peaky Blinders"" Cillian Murphy. Which is l, I'm realizing, a pattern of my adult life- pick a TV character you like and get their haircut. My whole childhood, I had a bowlcut. Then in high-school it was ""rebel long hair but not too long"" because you can't look like a girl. I live in the SE US and I work with kids. I know I can't be open open because I would possibly lose my dream job. So, any suggestions for more neutral, femme leaning longer hairstyles? Preferably something that can be braided or pulled back, but also flow. Tall order, I know.

What are some places that are 90% guaranteed to be friendly to someone not in their ""correct gender uniform"" other than gay bars (I like ours but my wife doesn't like the noise)?

203,Am I genderqueer?,"Can I be genderqueer?

I preciously thought I was definitely a cis woman, but I've been having doubt recently. I've been feeling more androgynous as of late--I like binding sometimes, I've been dressing more androgynous, and I took a couple quizzes that placed me on an androgynous/gender-indifferent scale (I know I know, quizzes can't determine gender).

I feel closest to a woman. I use she-her pronouns (I might use they/them but I'm unsure how I feel about them). I don't feel anything man-ly but I do like when people use masculine descriptors for me (for example, king as opposed to queen). 

On a scale from female to male where female is 1 and male is 10 (which is a gross oversimplification of gender but I couldn't think of a better analogy), I pretty regularly fluctuate between 1 and 3.

I've debated identifying as a demi-girl before, but I feel like it might be too specific and might place more emphasis on the non-binary part than applies to me. Non-binary as a label is too non-female for me too, I think. I like genderqueer as a label cause it can really mean anything that's not cis. 

I kind of like the term genderqueer woman because it emphasizes my female-ness while also saying something about my slight non-binary-ness.

204,Wanting to come out while following no stereotypes,"I'm a 17 AFAB pancurious genderqueer teen using all pronouns... Since a very young age, I have always felt like I'm neither just a woman or a man. As I love being both masculine and feminine, or even more than that. I equally love dresses and suits.. Ever since I got introduced to the term ""genderqueer"", I've been using it for myself as it feels like no other term describes me better than this, and it feels so beautiful to me idk why. 

I've been closeted since 2019.. I have already come out to my fellow queer peers. I am having the urge to come out to a group of my classmates, who are straight LGBT+ allies. However, I've always observed them guessing (& often misgendering) others sexuality or gender by leaning towards stereotypes, for example ""a bisexual girl must always wear septum piercing"" ""a gay guy must always act fruity"" ""a lesbian should be a tomboy"" As someone who still has to incline a bit more on the feminine side, I don't follow such stereotypes. But now- this is making me question myself a lot. Plus my friends always assume me to be a cishet despite me dropping hints. So I fear that they might see me as a queerbaiter on my coming-out. So all I wanna ask is- Is it possible to come out as GQ-pan or any identity/sexuality without leaning towards stereotypes?

206,Don't know what to do - Need Advice,"I am 22 and I identify as male and I'm pan but still in the closet and I have a girlfriend who knows and is understanding. I always present male but that's just because that's what feels safe and there's different ways I'd like to present but like I said it doesn't feel safe. That's also why I'm still in the closet because I don't think I could deal with any possible blowback from my family and friends and if everyone thinks I'm straight and I have a gf then it feels like it shouldn't matter what everyone else knows. I have a few social groups that are safe and understanding and I've come out to them but there's just some people in my life who aren't as understanding and I know they'd accept who I am but it would negatively affect how they see and interact with me. 

What I want to do is be comfortable outwardly with who I want to be and not feel scared. I'm not sure exactly what that is yet but I'm definitely not 100% male. 

An example of this issue is I bought some sweaters for the winter from a woman's clothing site and they're all something I'd like to wear but they don't fit right in line with a masculine image. The clothing isn't even that wild for what I normally wear, I'm just afraid that if I present how I want to present then people will think lesser of me, and I know that that can be very insulting to people who are currently out but I'm still trying to figure everything out and I can't overcome this fear. I don't want to risk business connections or social status or my image but I also want to be who I want to be.

Also the sweaters I bought is on the more mild side but I want to be able to dress however I want  and wear makeup and cute outfits and to just be comfortable being more androgynous because that's where I want to be and how I want to look.

Another issue contributing to this is just an issue I have with self image where I still haven't accepted how I look and sound in any regard. And maybe it's because I don't accept myself as the 100% masculine person I present as but I'm really just having trouble accepting both who I am and who I want to be.",z7dudo,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/z7dudo/dont_know_what_to_do_need_advice/,"['Hey Cantaloupe!

So- I‚Äôm afab, 20, married to a man. discovering who I am is complicated to say the least. Hence I‚Äôm on a subreddit asking for questions or, more genuinely, hoping to find someone in similar shoes.
I‚Äôve been questioning if I‚Äôm nonbinary or possibly gender fluid. Unsure which, the poin t is I‚Äôm questioning if I actually am cisgender, what being a woman means to me, if I want to be see by the world as a woman and all that entails that gender label. It‚Äôs hard right? In one week, not even, I‚Äôve not only tried on larger jeans with guy shirts and nearly cried, but I‚Äôve also experienced penis envy! I didn‚Äôt even know I could have that!
Quick context to the outfit: I simply have never tried on masculine clothes with the intent of presenting more masculine, hiding my feminine features etc. and it was more emotional and joyful than I thought I‚Äôd experience. It was the first gender euphoric thing I have experienced. Since then, I‚Äôve been deconstructing my gender even more. Which leads to now.
I‚Äôm unsure if this is simply because porn and kink, but I think I‚Äôm experiencing penis envy. Not even that I want it all the time. But like- I would love to have a penis and boobs?? But sometimes have my vagina cause I love that and maybe sometimes I don‚Äôt want my boobs so big, but I‚Äôm not too sure on that either.

Well thoughout the years I‚Äôve found myself drifting more and more to the feminine portions of my personality, and I decided recently on a whim to buy a pair of women‚Äôs underwear. Well let me just say idk what to make of the feeling I felt when I put them on but it kinda made me uncomfortable just how comfortable and right it felt. Well a week later I now have a sports bra and I‚Äôm wearing a pair of leggings (where have they been hiding this material, my god). I‚Äôve also felt driven to seek out a scheduling for an actual bra fitting and potentially a full body wax. I pulled out some toys I‚Äôve used on myself in the past and now I‚Äôm in a state where idk what to do with myself. I‚Äôm still very much attracted to women and I often very much still feel like a man. But this other part of me really craves the sensual soft feeling of presenting feminine and wearing curve hugging clothes that make me feel sexy even if looking at myself I don‚Äôt feel like I look sexy. 

I‚Äôve also kinda randomly wanted the feeling of sex with a man despite not feeling attracted to masculine features. Idk what that is or how to address it. 

Anyways. Sorry for the word vomit and idk what to make of this post but I had to put it out there in some capacity to try to find people who might have similar experiences and might be able to help guide me on what to make of it.

219,i have some troubles with clothes and gender expression :(,"So, i've been out of the closet for my closest family for genderqueer for a year by now, and i always dress as how i feel more comfortable, stopped using the regular bras that make me feel weird and stuff, but its been a really long time since i used dresses. 

The thing is, some away familiar send me from another country a really pretty dress, i felt so bad because i didnt know how to react or what to do with it (of course the away familiar doesnt know about my gender identity) 
I thought i wouldnt feel bad if i tried it on because ive been feeling really nice with how i look on my clothes and what i try to express or feel, so i lock my door and tried it. It looked good but i felt way to femenine and that broke me, i really didn't needed that

I decided id keep the dress but i dont think ill use it. Am i being stupid for thinking a dress is femenine? because i know the clothes doesnt make the gender but i still feel like that doesn't apply to me and i dont even care that much when people missgender me when they dont know, but i still feel kinda sad ofc, and now using a dress makes me feel like or the people ive already told about my gender ID will think bad of me or start using she pronouns or something. 
Or maybe im the problem for having internalized that  dress will make me less of who i am. 
For the record, used some kinds of bras before and i know when i actually dont want something, i cant stand those, but with this is different, i want to use it but it causes me way to much trouble :(

I thought that maybe getting usted to it would help me to feel confident with it, but it stills scares me. 
A friend told me not to force myself to use it and ofc i dont want to do that, but i still want to, just that, i dont know how to feel or think...
I have some transmasc friends who sometimes use dresses and they look so good with them and so strong and confident, but i cant feel the same for myself

Can anybody help me or tell me your opinion? How do i take off that stupid idea of dress=femenine?

221,Coming out to family - them feeling like you're criticising their gender or gender expression,"Hey pals,

So I'm afab, and during lockdown had a kind of sudden total collapse of my gender beliefs and where I fit. I'd been living in another country for a few years by now, and came home over summer once borders opened up. I'd come really far in how I felt about my own gender, and coming home felt like I had a Big Thing that I would like to try and share with my (very open-minded) family, but I was also a bit scared of what they'd think. I tested the waters a bit with a few 'casual' statements about clothes etc, and the next time my closest sister and I were in the car together she asked me fairly directly about how I feel about my gender. I essentially started coming out to her, but it kind of ended up being sort of confrontational or offended from her end, like I was giving up on being a woman or was kind of selling out for not feeling like a woman. I feel like in her response to the things I was (very tentatively) saying she was tending to centre herself, giving examples of how she'd found being a woman hard but then countering by saying ""but that doesn't mean I want to just give up on being a woman"". It made me feel like I was betraying The Sisterhood in some way, and it made us both upset to the point that we mutually agreed to stop talking about it altogether. 

I want to point out that my sister is very loving, open and empathetic.

223,"I need some help, I keep having mini crises, and feel comfortable using he/they pronouns","Im a 23y/o Bisexual (probably, its another issue) guy staying with my parents while I do a teacher training course.   

For the past couple of months I keep having mini crises in between the stresses of my course. 

It really started over this summer while I had the house to myself, and got back into a little bit of my Drag stuff. One night in my dress, bra and boots I noticed I looked really nice, felt a bit of euphoria I think, and that kinda kicked it off; though on reflection I've been toying for the past few years while at uni. 

Feeling I'm something other than male, changing pronouns and dressing up isnt something I feel comfortable I can do or bring up with my parents. When I came out as Bi to them and my aunt & uncle   wasn't exactly smooth, and I didn't feel I got the best support from them; but they didn't reject me so its alright?  People being NB/genderqueer, etc hasn't come up in conversation much but small comments from both of them make it hard for me to judge their feelings on it and I'm too worried to bring it up with them if they start asking why.

224,Is there a category for this?,"Apologies if the following question is unclear as english is not my first language.

Alrighty, so I'm in a slight dilemma. Where I'm from, gender identity and all that relates to it is not openly discussed as the older generations have unanimously decided that such questions are taboo. The only people I can have discussions of gender identity with are my peers. I'm ok with being a girl, I don't hate it when I'm referred to a girl, more of a neutral stance, but I really enjoy being referred to as a guy. Yet again, I don't want to transition, there's this weird line between being a guy and girl that i feel comfortable being on. Like I'm fine with both but I prefer being gendered as a guy. 

I should probably mention that I'm AFAB, if that's important to the context. I have tried googling if there was a label for that feeling so so far I have not manage to find one that is suitable for me. So this is my question: Is what I'm feeling something that's already been labeled and if so, what is it?",yzdfbi,18,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/yzdfbi/is_there_a_category_for_this/,"[""You could just be a masculine presenting female?\n\nLike, I don't have this experience myself, but my sister (lesbian, afab) is so masculine presenting that strangers call her sir and while she doesn't react how I feel you would (she finds it funny) it might work for you?\n\nthat said, it might not, so theres not a guarantee of anything happening from this, yk?"", 'Bigender? Androgyne?\n\nI\'m half agender / half bigender/androgyne myself, so I get what you mean by ""here\'s this weird line between being a guy and girl that i feel comfortable being on"". Half of me lives exactly there. Half of me is a guy and gal altogether. And I don\'t plan to transition too. It doesn\'t matter at all, it doesn\'t make anybody ""less trans"" etc.', ""So I'm also afab and also like being referred to as a guy, though I'm not sure if my experience could be relevant to you but I found what you describe similar to how I felt in the past so I thought you might find it useful.. \nSo I would view gender in two ways: psychological and social. I would consider myself agender because I don't have a gender identity or perceive myself in a gendered way, it feels more like I'm stuck in a body that's constantly being gendered. You could be gender apathetic (you don't care what gender people refer to you as or gender in general) or it could make you uncomfortable when people apply gender to you. While I don't experience gender psychologically, I do identify with being a guy socially. I like looking masculine, I tend to have more in common with guys and I like being mistaken for or be called a guy. Though for me being called a guy is only in specific ways, for example I really like being called a boy but i don't feel right being called a guy. I say that it might not be relevant because when I started questioning my gender, I didn't really mind being called a woman and just thought that I don't care about gender but once I got comfortable with not having a gender, it started to really bother me when people referred to me as a woman or perceived me in a feminine way. Likewise, my body didn't really bother me, then it didn't bother me in a physical way but I wanted my chest to look flat when around other people, and now my chest just really bothers me all the time. This obviously isn't everyone's experience and doesn't mean that you'll start feeling the same way, but your perception of your gender could change over time as you start getting more comfortable with yourself. \n\nSo maybe it's worth questioning if you're agender and/or gender apathetic but identify with being a guy socially. Or maybe you like being called/mistaken for a guy because it's more gender affirming to be referred to as a gender different from the one that you were assigned at birth?"", 'You may be a demiguy.

I also use both pronouns him and her. \n\nI would suggest looking up genderqueer and maybe just sitting with it and asking yourself if it feels right. And really try to ask yourself if you really feel male and female or is it more of the attributes we assign to those sexes? Maybe you‚Äôre just more masculine than feminine. Or neutral. \n\nI had to allow myself to sit on these thoughts and do some deep thought to figure out where I land. I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your environment and not being able to talk more freely about it but hopefully this will help!', 'I am a bit on the other side of the line. I am AMAB and have only recently been exploring my gender fluidity. I feel masculine some of the time and much more feminine at others. How I have approached it is just embracing he/she/they pronouns and asks those who know know me be to use them all at times. \n\nFor me it changes, sometimes throughout the day.

227,Not really feeling like a they after starting HRT,"Hi. Hello. Hoping to get some advice//hear others experiences. Two years ago I started to question my gender. Never before had I actively considered it, I just always assumed I was a man. It wasn't until a close friend at the time said to me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre more feminine‚Äù that I actually started to think. The following few years were a huge struggle from covid to my own depression//suicidal ideation//drug issues and behind all of that sat a desire to be more feminine. To be seen always as They//them and nothing else. I tried to grow my hair out, then shaved it on multiple occasions, I experimented with makeup and dresses and dyed my hair stupidly frequently. Behind all of THAT was this little voice in my head saying ‚Äúyou should go on HRT‚Äù. But I was too scared. Constantly second guessing and wondering if this is what I actually wanted, or if I wanted to force everyone elses perception of me to change. Within the past year I reached a point where I was really comfortable with my gender identity. I got sober (which helped me to see myself clearly) and found myself with 2 cats, amazing friends, and a good job. I was happy. And then that voice came back. Not that it ever went away, but it started growing louder. I became close with another friend in sobriety who is trans and found that our thoughts on transitioning had a lot of similarities, which in the past had deterred me from pursuing E. A huge part of these HRT thoughts came from a place of fetishization for me. When I was 12 or 13 I stumbled onto trans porn and became addicted. Comics, animations, real life, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from consuming the content. And a part of me wanted to be those women that I saw, who had the physicality of every sex. I lusted after this unrealistic goal of women with ridiculously sized sex organs. I wanted to be that. I don‚Äôt know how real those thoughts were because they seem so far away now. I‚Äôve actively avoided porn (especially that particular area) cause I was so grossed out by myself every time that I masturbated
And then 5 months ago, without really telling anyone, I went to the clinic, got my lab tests, and started getting shots of E. When I started feeling breast tissue I got so so so excited. But within the past month or so all that excited energy has vanished. Now I hate seeing myself in the mirror, I avoid showers so that I don‚Äôt have to be exposed to myself for too long. I no longer feel queer and when I look down and see how my nipples push out I‚Äôm just upset. And I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle of second guessing and wondering if this is actually for me. I felt so certain about this just a few months ago and now‚Ä¶. Now I don‚Äôt know what I want. So‚Ä¶ yeah.

233,no longer feeling they//them after strating HRT,"Hi. Hello. Hoping to get some advice//hear others experiences.
Two years ago I started to question my gender. Never before had I actively considered it, I just always assumed I was a man. It wasn't until a close friend at the time said to me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre more feminine‚Äù that I actually started to think. The following few years were a huge struggle from covid to my own depression//suicidal ideation//drug issues and behind all of that sat a desire to be more feminine. To be seen always as They//them and nothing else. I tried to grow my hair out, then shaved it on multiple occasions, I experimented with makeup and dresses and dyed my hair stupidly frequently. Behind all of THAT was this little voice in my head saying ‚Äúyou should go on HRT‚Äù. But I was too scared. Constantly second guessing and wondering if this is what I actually wanted, or if I wanted to force everyone elses perception of me to change. 
Within the past year I reached a point where I was really comfortable with my gender identity. I got sober (which helped me to see myself clearly) and found myself with 2 cats, amazing friends, and a good job. I was happy. 
And then that voice came back. Not that it ever went away, but it started growing louder. I became close with another friend in sobriety who is trans and found that our thoughts on transitioning had a lot of similarities, which in the past had deterred me from pursuing E. A huge part of these HRT thoughts came from a place of fetishization for me. When I was 12 or 13 I stumbled onto trans porn and became addicted. Comics, animations, real life, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from consuming the content. And a part of me wanted to be those women that I saw, who had the physicality of every sex. I lusted after this unrealistic goal of women with ridiculously sized sex organs. I wanted to be that. I don‚Äôt know how real those thoughts were because they seem so far away now. I‚Äôve actively avoided porn (especially that particular area) cause I was so grossed out by myself every time that I masturbated  
And then 5 months ago, without really telling anyone, I went to the clinic, got my lab tests, and started getting shots of E. 
When I started feeling breast tissue I got so so so excited. But within the past month or so all that excited energy has vanished. Now I hate seeing myself in the mirror, I avoid showers so that I don‚Äôt have to be exposed to myself for too long. I no longer feel queer and when I look down and see how my nipples push out I‚Äôm just upset. 
And I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle of second guessing and wondering if this is actually for me. I felt so certain about this just a few months ago and now‚Ä¶. Now I don‚Äôt know what I want.
So‚Ä¶ yeah. Would love to hear any advice y‚Äôall got or just your experiences in this realm",ywcjdf,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/ywcjdf/no_longer_feeling_theythem_after_strating_hrt/,[]

235,Yet another ‚Äúwho the hell am I‚Äù post,"I‚Äôll be 53 in 2 weeks. 

I‚Äôve never felt aligned to my biological gender. 

My parents‚Äîand birth family‚Äîare conservative in all ways that matter. Females were always of secondary value‚Äîit was made clear that males could do all the things, females were destined to be housewives, mothers, and maybe occupiers of paid roles (secretary, school teacher, etc) that would never have a salary close to or exceeding a male‚Äôs.

I remember being crushed when I discovered that I was not one of those lucky rare folks whose masculinity appeared at puberty.

I was in my 40s before I got why getting a mastectomy because of cancer was a horrible fate for women. (Other than what my medical phobia understood.)

I dislike the majority of things written ‚Äúfor women‚Äù. Like books for women curious about their spirituality or books about the ‚Äúfeminine divine‚Äù. On the other hand, I definitely can see value in some of these, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wholly the voice in these books.

In fact, I was prompted to write this after unearthing a book on the feminine divine while I was cleaning.

As soon as I finish the legal paperwork associated with resolving my late husband‚Äôs finances, I‚Äôm going to change my name to something less femme than what I was given by my abusive mother. (There‚Äôs another possible disconnect from the concept of ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù for me.)

I wish I could find a simple answer for myself. I wish I could say definitely that my earliest memories of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a girl‚Äù were untainted by my indoctrination by my rigidly conservative family. I‚Äôll never know. It makes me angry.

I feel like the name change will help move me off of that level of disconnect, tho.

Maybe I just like the idea of being a man? I get a lot of thoughts about going on hormone therapy as well. I guess my ‚Äúdream body‚Äù is something like Jungkook from BTS, and the thing about this is, do I consider someone like him my dream body because that it was society says is attractive? Would I be happy presenting more masculine if I was at the same weight I am now, or do I only want to ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù if I would have a conventionally attractive body?

238,is it okay to identify as a genderqueer woman?,"Hi, Im 20 and AFAB i've been struggling with my gender identity for a while, something about not being read as a woman anymore feels wrong   but  at the same time have some incongruent feelings:  I find really difficult to know if I just like how certain boys look or if i want to be them, i try to ask myself :"" would I be happier if I transition to have a more masculine body?""

 I am so confused rn,  sometimes I feel like i just want to look good and i can't find clothes that suits my body type and i don't even know what gender expression would make me happy, I know that dresses makes me uncomfy but idk nothing else, my life consists in envying people that look good in anything because they are skinny , and evying people who can cope with uncertancy, I am so miserable, labels give me anxiety but I feel like I need one, like I need to know and be certain about my gender, I relate a lot with girls and I'm very okay with being read as one even if I am not sure if I ""feel"" like one. but when I am in a crisis of OCD i feel like an imposter, like I am an imposter because I feel different from other girls and can't figure out If i just simply  find male body more aesthetic than a female one or I need that male body to be full and happy. I am a mess and by now the only thing I know for sure is that I dislike my body because of my weight, that male body is more aesthetic but idk if there is something else (something trans)  but thinking about me transitioning (socially or physically) would really feel like me ""changing"" like being another person. Anyone can relate ?

239,"So I think I'm gender indifferent, but I was wondering if there's a more common way to describe it.","Hi folks, so I had the realization over the last month or so that I might be gender fluid, but also not. The term I've been using is ""Gender Indiferent"" or ""Gender fluid in a cup"" which works, but I wanted to see if there's another way people would describe it. 

The way I've come to describe it is with a cups analogy. Basically, you have a whole bunch of cups, all different colors and I'm the liquid in a blue cup. I'm firmly in the blue cup and will happily identify as blue, but because I'm just inside the cup, I don't mind if you call me red or yellow or purple. At the same time, if you were to pick me up and pour me into the red cup, life wouldn't really change for me. I'm still just the liquid. I'd probably more identify as red at that point, but wouldn't mind being called blue. 

To put it in more common terms, I identify as a cis male, but mainly because that's how I've always presented. I identify most with he/him pronouns, but don't mind any particular pronouns. I don't feel like Gender Fluid fits quite right because I do currently feel firmly male, but if I woke up tomorrow with a female body, it wouldn't change the way I view myself all that much if at all. I'm not Agender because I definitely feel like I have a gender, but said gender just... isn't important(?); thus gender indifferent.

I didn't really understand it because nothing else quite fit from all the identities and labels I looked into, I just knew that I did at the very least feel a way I couldn't quite put into words. It helps alot to see people have a similar experience!"", ""I used to like 'gendermeh' when I identified more like this! :)"", 'Gender ambivalent is the most commonly accepted/established phrase.', 'This is an absolutely terrific analogy for what i‚Äôve been feeling but unable to describe', 'I\'ve been writing about this very phenomenon for many years. I\'ll try and sum it up here.\n\n""Cisgender"" is defined based on the assumption that everyone has a ""gender identity"" by default. Yet just because someone is not transgender, doesn\'t mean they automatically have an internal sense of being a specific gender. It\'s far more likely that most people in society don\'t think about gender in terms of feelings, even though that is a prerequisite for being cisgender. Hence we end up with a lot more questions than answers.\n\nCase in point: I accept being male, but not because I feel gender internally. Rather society has said my ""sex"" is male, and I was raised to believe that boy and man are the appropriate terms to describe my sex-related role. However, I\'m not locked into specific gendered terms. I\'m okay with being called she/her, miss, etc. If I been raised with different gender terminology and gender expectations, I very likely would have just accepted those as well. In that respect I don\'t identify with gender at all. I just go with the flow.\n\nI imagine that what you described may be far more common than most people realize, as a lot of people simply never have a reason to think about gender outside the norm. But there\'s no research to date to ascertain whether this is the case. Most surveys dealing with gender variance, focus on trans and nonbinary people. Even the latest U.S. Trans Survey states in its FAQ that it is intended only for ""anyone who identifies with a different gender than they were assigned at birth.""\n\nThis is one of the reasons why around 2014, I devised the concept of ambigender -- which provides space for people who feel gender ambiguous and/or gender ambivalant to some degree (hence the prefix) without specifically identifying as another gender. My goal is to finally acknowledge that there are far diverse experiences of gender that cannot be fully captured within the binary framework of cis/trans.', 'I feel extremely similar to this and I really like the term gender indifferent! I only heard gender apathetic', ""this pretty much perfectly explains how I feel about gender. I don't really mind too much being seen as a girl, but I don't think I'm fully a girl either. I have found it too difficult to pin down my gender so have given up"", ""Gender-indifferent/gender-apathetic would probably be what you'd say, though I think the specific label is cassgender."", '""Shrug gender"" is a way I\'ve seen it described.']"
240,Does fancying someone make your dysphoria go haywire?,"I enjoy musing over gender although I practically never get a chance to discuss it myself for fear of giving the game away. This particular subject has probably impacted my life quite significantly, for the most part by stymieing me and others. And I bring it up here because I've never been lucky enough to passively observe others discussing it.

&#x200B;

I'm 31 and consider myself genderqueer, not in the closet so much as being crushed underneath it. I came to terms with it around this time last year, told one (1) friend who I knew would be good about it, and haven't really done anything about it since. I'm not sure what to do about it and who it would ever be worth telling. But I don't exactly want to stay still, grow old and die either.

&#x200B;

Here we go then. I've never really been in a relationship, and that's partially because I can't be honest with myself and the other party. When I'm taken by someone my dysphoria either goes into overdrive, or lessens to the point that I find myself denying that it could have ever been a problem.

&#x200B;

In sexual preference, I am a pretty red-meat male. My interest is almost definitely female, and definitely femme. I can appreciate how that means I am almost certainly perpetrating misogyny and that my gender identity doesn't absolve any of this. (Please address it with me when and where I exhibit this misogyny on this difficult subject.) I can also appreciate how a woman or femme who would like me back, would almost definitely be expecting a male, a man, and some masculine performance. I further appreciate the irony between a life of paralysing gender confusion in myself, and my awe towards feminine behaviour, dress, shape and scent. Sorry for how disgusting that sounds, but I struggle to phrase it in both an honest and decent way.

&#x200B;

However I feel that with every crush I've had, there's an intractable side where I desire to be more like that person in some way. Not to *fully be* them, but to partially embody who they are. This is mostly impersonal: I simply want to be effeminate like them; some of their specific traits I may fancy for myself as I see them right in front of me, but on the whole it is their feminine brilliance that puts me at a loss. It leaves me pretty anguished to see myself writing that out, as I imagine it's a perspective could lead to abusive behaviour if left unchecked. On that note I have spent my adulthood quietly addressing behaviour of mine that may be creepy and removing that side of myself. Where somebody is being mistreated for being a woman or femme, they could very well be me in a life where I'm more open. Therefore their cause is mine.

&#x200B;

That disruptive aspect to it is what makes this such a difficult confession, and one I feel I'd never be able to admit to a love interest. And because of that, there is a barrier that's almost always present when I'm wishing to be romantic. In doing so they will see more of me, and I can choose either to put on a front indefinitely, or to reveal that I don't perceive myself fully as a man, which not only can hurt, disturb or amuse them but also exposes the most vulnerable, weaponisable thing about me. As a result it seems to be safer to never get involved in the first place, and spend my life sighing in the distance. An arrangement where I'm viewed as entirely man and expected to be a man feels like it would be a half-death to me.

&#x200B;

The other side? As mentioned, if things seem to be advancing and it seems I'm being perceived fully as a man and liked for being such, my dysphoria can go away and I can feel more inclined to flirt and pursue someone (not like it's ever worked too well!). Having said that, since I came to terms with being genderqueer, I've felt this way quite solidly with only varying intensity in how keenly I don't feel like a man.

&#x200B;

I spent last night with a few female friends and acquaintances who are such nourishing company that it took a long time to part ways despite how tired I was. In their ranks is a woman I find incredibly beautiful, with an assuring presence and the kind of energy and positivity she can pull from nowhere that I always clamour for. We're rather different, but I am with virtually everyone. I mention to you that she changed out of her skirt before kicking back with us at the end of the day because she joked when I got a bit of food on my jeans that I could go home in her skirt instead, to which I replied that I'd do the wriggle of shame if it came to that, all pretty throwaway in free-flowing conversation, but it felt like such a provocation! The kind of thing I'd go along with if nobody saw anything more in it than I saw in it! Would I even be able to guess if she meant anything of it - can she read that she likes me? Can she read into any of the unfulfillment I live with by presenting men's characteristics with a man's appearance in the most vaguely effeminate way I can feel I can get away with in my small-town, male-dominated world? If so, can she somehow juggle these seemingly contradictory perceptions?

&#x200B;

Anyway, it pretty much tees up my brain to run through these questions again. Why does my wish to be more feminine follow suit with the intensity of my crushing? Should this make me as ashamed as I am? When most men are around women they seem to reassert their masculinity. When I'm around women I try to relate to them by leaning in. When I do so a lot of pressure releases from within, and is replaced by pressure to not overdo it or to be harmful.

&#x200B;

But recently I started to question my identity, and it seems that I only identify as a women because my body is very feminine looking (large hips, large breasts etc...) and because it is written on my ID card. Outside of that I don't feel anything about my gender (except maybe sometimes when I dress up in a feminine way I'm happy but it's because it suits my body)

I get a lot more mileage out of questions like ""what does it feel like to *see myself* as a woman/man/whatever?""\n\nI used to think that I pretty much didn\'t see myself as my AGAB, i.e. it didn\'t have much to do with how I understood myself. But then over time I started noticing more and more how people, including myself, are programmed to parse people, including themselves, into these two categories, ""man"" and ""woman"", and build their understanding of each other on that. And realizing the depth to which I was doing that to myself pretty much cracked my egg.\n\nSo for me, the insight comes from asking ""what gender am I parsing myself as"", and not ""what gender do I feel like"".\n  * When I watch a movie or read a book, who do I see myself in?\n  * When I process my emotions, what gender roles do I pull my understanding from? (E.g. if I\'m angry, am I reading myself as an ""angry woman"", an ""angry man"", or just ""angry person"", and how are those different?)\n  * When I\'m in a group of people do I mentally pick up on a ""gender line"" in the group, and if so where do I put myself in relation to that line?\n  * Do I gravitate towards parsing my social behaviors in terms of ""gender dynamics"" for a particular gender?\n\nAnd then when I feel I have a handle on some those things (which takes a lot of work), I dig into gender identity in terms of how I feel *about* these various ways of ""parsing myself"". Once I can see the difference between having one self-image vs another, and how it affects my life, I can start thinking about what I feel more at home in, or what draws me more, etc.', 'Don\'t be sorry for posting this! I know what it\'s like to feel a bit lost and confused need some answers.\n\nOnly you can answer the question of what your gender is, but I can tell you your experience sounds a little like mine. I was a teenager when the Spice Girls were talking about girl power, and Shania Twain was singing about feeling like a woman. I could not relate to either of these things. I couldn\'t work out what feeling like a woman was supposed to be like, even though I apparently was becoming one. Usually I\'m happy enough wearing ladieswear, but wearing anything revealing or that made me look particularly womanly has always made me feel really uncomfortable. Eventually I learned that that feeling is gender dysphoria, and I\'m non-binary. Still I do tend to feel happy if I\'m looking good in ladieswear. But I\'m a feminine non-binary person so it\'s in keeping with who I am anyway. \n\nIt is possible to be trans, non-binary or genderless without feeling dysphoria at any point. For some people it\'s more a matter of trying out different gender presentations, and feeling euphoria when they find the right one, and that\'s how some people recognise what their gender is.\n\nSo maybe you\'re happy in ladieswear because you\'re a woman, or maybe you\'ll find that a bit of experimentation will lead you to realise you\'re not a woman. You could find that thinking of yourself as non-binary, genderless or genderqueer just feels right without changing your presentation. Or you could try dressing differently if the idea appeals to you at all and see how it feels. I think there\'s a ""pronoun dressing room"" somewhere on the internet where you can put in a name and pronouns, and it will generate text as if someone is talking about you, so you can see how it feels to have a different name and/or pronouns, if the idea appeals.\n\nWhatever you do, whatever the outcome, don\'t worry, you\'re not the first person to feel like you do, and you won\'t be the last.

242,I wish that there were more outwardly genderqueer spaces and communities,"To be honest, this sub has been healing to witness.

But sometimes I can approach it and it\'s nice.\n\nI am not sure if this will resonate with you, but I\'ve found several things helpful for dealing with feelings like you describe:\n\n* Cut out gender-binaristic messages and people who push those messages, from your life, and surround yourself with people who de-emphasize or ignore gender. This might not look like what you think it would. When I first started realizing I was nonbinary, I (wrongly) thought that I would necessarily be most comfortable in more progressive spaces and spaces that were explicitly affirming of LGBTQ people. While some of these spaces can be really supportive, a lot of them can be polluted with heavy reasoning on the basis of gender, more so than the world as a whole is.\n* Seek out activities and spaces that seem to operate independently of gender. This could be spaces where there are enough gender-non-conforming people that the vibe in the space kind of transcends gender, but it could also be spaces that have nothing to do with gender and are more driven by practical constraints. As an example, I find I feel most comfortable in outdoor activities especially communities of naturalists who are intensely interested in plants, animals, and ecology. A lot of people in these spaces tend to dress in practical ways driven by the environment and the activities they\'re doing, and there is less gender differentiation in clothing and presentation, and because people are focused on nature-centered activities, gender becomes less important. An example of a space that is at the opposite end of things would be a bar where people are trying to hit on people or pick people up for casual sex. This sort of spaces tends to be intensely gendered, with strong gender differentiation in clothing and behavior and everything gets read through the lens of cisnormativity and heteronormativity and it can be really stifling. You don\'t need to find an explicitly LGBTQ-friendly space for it to be more-or-less ""gender-free"", sometimes just finding a space that is centered on a specific interest or activity that doesn\'t really relate to gender, is sufficient, sometimes it\'s even better.\n* Work on overall mental health and overall self-care, including on things that may seem unrelated. For me, I found that overcoming depression and anxious thought patterns helped greatly reduce my dysphoria. When I\'m thinking more rationally and more positively overall, and feeling more secure and calmer and just all-around better, dysphoria comes up less frequently, feels less intense when I feel it, and is more manageable.\n\nYou can\'t control other people but you can choose who to associate with, what relationships to prioritize, what spaces and subcultures to immerse yourself in. And you can choose how and when to do self-care. Use all these choices in your favor!!! You do have a lot of wiggle room here and while it won\'t fully solve these problems, it can make them a heck of a lot more manageable.', 'I‚Äôm not sure if this is this the same thing but I just wish when people looked at me they would have no idea what gender I am.

252,Does anyone else relate to this?,"Just curious if anyone relates to this thought process/feeling and if so, what do you make of it for yourself? 

I'm AFAB and a few years ago, I thought I was genderqueer because half the time I wanted to present as a man. When I presented masculine, I wore a binder, men's clothing, and contoured my face. Sometimes I packed my pants too, just for the feeling. I was still very obviously AFAB because of my height and facial features, but people asked me what my pronouns were and that made me so happy. And growing up, I was often mistaken as a boy, which I loved. 

Then for the last few years, I lived in Korea where it is very heteronormative and gendered. I didn't really have the desire to present masculine. Actually, I became very stereotypically feminine and always wanted to be perceived as a pretty woman. Since I didn't have the desire to be a man while I was in Korea, I figured I was cis and liked to change things up in the US. 

I'm back in the US now and I'm getting back into presenting masculine sometimes. And I've been feeling that conflict again of wishing I could randomly wake up with a man's body maybe 1/3 of the time? I don't mind being a woman though. Actually, I love being a woman usually. I only get REALLY bothered and uncomfortable when I try to present masculine, but just look like a woman in men's clothing. My stomach drops, my skin crawls, and I feel kind of disgusted by myself?? And I dissociate unless I look ""masculine enough."" I both love and HATE how feminine my face is and how short I am.

253,The 9th annual Freedressing Awareness Day is coming up in exactly one month. So I compiled a handy FAQ to explain why genderqueer and gender nonconforming folks need a day of visibility.,"# Freedressing Awareness Day takes place on December 3!

It doesn't seem possible that Freedressing Awareness Day is almost here -- a day to promote freedom of gender expression, but even more specifically to raise much needed awareness about the struggles of genderqueer and gender nonconforming people. I started the day back in 2013 in response to the death of Frank Wolf, a popular femboy cosplayer on YouTube who was bullied for being effeminate.

**Are there any efforts to raise awareness for gender nonconforming people?**

Unfortunately, few LGBTQ organizations specifically advocate for gender nonconforming people, particularly boys and men. There are, of course, numerous awareness campaigns  devoted to lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people as well as for girls and women.

It Gets Better Project is one of the rare exceptions. It was founded in 2010 by Dan Savage after learning about the suicide of a feminine boy who had been teased and taunted in school. To this day, it remains the only major LGBTQ organization that still actively campaigns for gender nonconforming youth, while others have shifted focus primarily to trans and nonbinary youth.

**Why should we celebrate freedom of gender expression?**

Simple: Pride isn't only about gender identity or sexual orientation. For decades trans activists fought for freedom of gender expression, with a particular emphasis on gender nonconformity. In fact ""transgender"" was originally an umbrella for anyone whose gender identity OR gender expression didn't align with their sex assigned at birth. This entire notion that gender nonconforming people, regardless of their sexuality, can't have pride contravenes decades of historic precedent.

For example, take this 1996 interview with Leslie Feinberg, who's widely regarded as the principal architect of the modern transgender rights movement:

[https://i.imgur.com/JCgchK7.png](https://i.imgur.com/JCgchK7.png)

Therefore, whenever people try to argue that pride isn't about defying gender stereotypes, they are promoting a deeply homophobic historical revisionist ideal of queerness -- the aim of which was to completely strip ""gender rights"" from gay rights.

**Isn't freedom of gender expression only for queer people?**

Anyone can participate in Freedressing Awareness Day, including feminine boys and androgynous people. The very idea that gender nonconformity has nothing to do with being queer has its origins in anti-gay propaganda. 

For decades gay men were persecuted for expressing effeminate behaviors and mannerisms. So as part of an effort to distance being ""gay"" with stereotypes of femininity and thereby assimilate into mainstream society, large numbers of gay men began promoting an anti-feminine image of male homosexuality.

[https://i.imgur.com/wVlUQAI.png](https://i.imgur.com/wVlUQAI.png)

By the early 1990s, queer activists sought to counter the growing spate of femmephobia in the gay rights movement by creating a broadly inclusive umbrella for all ""gender outlaws"", including transsexuals, femme gay men, butch lesbians, drag queens, and yes straight crossdressers, etc. under the rubric of ""transgender"".

Even as far back the 1970s trans activists recognized that transgender and gender nonconforming people (known as transsexuals and transvestites at the time) should be united along the same front for ""trans liberation"" since they face similar oppression. This passage appeared in the 1971 issue of Gay Liberator:

[https://i.imgur.com/nvzCt7W.png](https://i.imgur.com/nvzCt7W.png)

**How is freedressing different from crossdressing?**

I prefer to avoid the term crossdressing for the simple fact that it upholds binary gender stereotypes, and applies disproportionately to feminine gender expression. So in 2004, I coined the term ""freedressing"" and launched the Freedressing Campaign, because guys deserve fashion freedom just as much as girls.

**Are gender nonconforming people really at risk of discrimination?**

Numerous studies have concluded that gender nonconforming youth, particularly feminine boys, are at elevated risk of harassment, depression, and suicidal ideation.

A study by JAMA Pediatrics revealed that of 6,082 high school students, gender nonconforming females were at 22 percent higher than average risk of mental illness but gender nonconforming males were at an astonishing 55 percent higher than average risk of mental illness. And it doesn't end there. Gender nonconforming females were 52 percent more likely to plan for suicide whereas gender nonconforming males were 79 percent more likely to plan for suicide and also twice as likely as their female counterparts to attempt suicide.

In 2017, The Williams Institute at UCLA conducted the first comprehensive survey of gender nonconforming youth in California. Of the participants, one in four teens said their classmates viewed them as resisting dominant forms of gender expression. The study determined that high school students perceived by their peers to be noticeably gender ambiguous experienced over double the average levels of psychological distress than their peers (18% versus 7%).

The *GLSEN 2015 National School Climate Survey* revealed that lesbian, gay, and bisexual students don‚Äôt just get bullied for their sexual orientation, but moreso for their gender expression. This disparity was prevalent even in schools with an LGBTQ inclusive curriculum.

The Human Rights Campaign's 2012 survey *Supporting and Caring for our Gender-Expansive Youth* further highlights the particular dangers that gender nonconforming youth altogether face:

*""Gender expression is the initial, often primary, source of harassment, discrimination, and violence that confronts many of our youth. Quite simply, children and youth perceived to be different in their gender are often targeted by their peers. While lesbian, gay, bisexual youth experience significant levels of harassment and bullying related to their sexual orientation, the levels re even higher for those who defy gender conventions and expectations.""*

**How exactly are gender nonconforming people marginalized?**

Gender nonconforming people are marginalized for defying sex-based stereotypes. Sex-based stereotypes also underlie the stigmas and biases that led to decades of systemic inequities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.

The Supreme Court of the United States came to this very conclusion in the case of *Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)*. That ruling hinged on the 1989 SCOTUS case of a gender nonconforming woman who was denied a job promotion because she looked and acted too ""manly"".

[https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2019/04/24/boom-lawyered-price-waterhouse-v-hopkins-edition/](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2019/04/24/boom-lawyered-price-waterhouse-v-hopkins-edition/)

In other words, it was determined that a trans woman and a gay man are deserving of equal employment rights under federal law because a masculine woman had previously secured those same rights. Thus legal precedent had been established that discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people are all rooted in sex-based stereotypes.

Go back a few more years to 2015, and you can see that countless LGBTQ organizations confirmed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, *and* gender nonconforming people are deserving of equal rights under the Equality Act:

[https://i.imgur.com/gB4pPf5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gB4pPf5.png)

That same year, HuffPost reported that gender nonconforming youth, alongside transgender youth, suffer high rates of discrimination and violence, and therefore LGBTQ organizations must collaborate to address that crisis:

[https://i.imgur.com/iZwc0Kj.png](https://i.imgur.com/iZwc0Kj.png)

**Do gender nonconforming people really need a day of visibility?**

If you look at queer history over the past 50 years, some of the loudest voices calling for trans liberation were actually drag queens, drag kings, gay crossdressers, butch lesbians and other gender nonconformists.

Even Holly Boswell, the designer of the transgender symbol, recognized the importance of bridging the gap between crossdressers and transsexuals as far back as the 1990s.

[https://tgforum.com/i-didnt-know-holly/](https://tgforum.com/i-didnt-know-holly/)

Leslie Feinberg believed that diversity of gender expression was essential to combating gender-based oppression and therefore advanced the idea of a ""transgender umbrella"".

[https://jessieraefisher.medium.com/be-trans-read-leslie-feinberg-f3d45a2a40ee](https://jessieraefisher.medium.com/be-trans-read-leslie-feinberg-f3d45a2a40ee)

**It's not like defying gender roles is anything special, right?**

You might be surprised to know that the original trailblazers of transgender rights didn't hold this view. Many believed it to be the exact opposite -- achieving freedom of gender expression was of critical importance to transgender liberation.

In fact, gender nonconforming people have long been the catalyst for major strides in LGBTQ rights -- like Storme DeLarverie, the butch lesbian and drag king that is credited with being the first to resist arrest during the police raid at the Stonewall Inn in 1969, or Lee Brewster, the gay crossdresser and drag queen that campaigned to successfully repeal New York City's anti-crossdressing ordinance in the early 1970s, or like like Marsha P. Johnson, the gay crossdresser and drag queen that co-founded the the nation's first homeless shelter for transgender and gender nonconforming people in 1970, or like Leslie Feinberg, the butch lesbian that published a manifesto formally announcing the creation of a transgender rights movement in 1992.

Queer theorists like Judith Butler and Ricki Anne Wilchins also point to overt acts of crossdressing as a means to disrupt the socially contrived categories of gender and sexuality for the benefit of both men and women alike.

""Okay to be me"" can be said by a million people and mean a million different things.  Let\'s take a look at three popular perspectives on what that means right now, when someone is talking about ""being their true self"":\n\n1) One way of looking at it is: If you\'re sexually attracted to the same sex, repression of that attraction can do a lot of harm psychologically and emotionally. Everyone is familiar with the unfair treatment of homosexuals in a variety of ways in the past. In this perspective, ""being your true self"" entails accepting ones homosexuality and for others to be tolerant of it. This is perfectly fine. This deals with sexual orientation.\n\n2) Another way of looking at ""being your true self"" that has some truth is that some people\'s ""true selves"" once discovered are ""queer"" - they like things that are outside the norm. It is less about sexual orientation and more about transforming hedonism into something acceptable. It is the difference between ""Behind close doors and between consenting adults."" and ""Let your freak flag fly, 24/7."" No one minds (or even knows) about their co-workers sexual proclivities as long as they are done in privacy and with the consent of those involved. It\'s a private thing that does not affect your day to day life. However, if someone takes their hedonistic sexual peccadillos and decides that\'s who their ""true self"" is and they should bring that into the public sphere, and the political sphere - that is something very different compared to the first perspective, wouldn\'t you say?\n\n3) Another perspective, one not much discussed, is the religious-like and gnostic belief of ""being your true self"". This is relatively detached from both previous perspectives and is cult-like in it\'s internal logic. This logic holds that God cannot know himself, and so embedded himself in everything so he could learn about himself (I told you it was religious-like). As such, if you regularly masturbate to the image of yourself as a woman, that is a piece of God within you and is in essence your ""true self"" that should not be denied. The same goes for ""Minor Attracted Persons"" (pedophiles). It\'s simply your true self, and should be welcomed, affirmed and claims oppression if it\'s adherents are not allowed to ""be their true selves.""\n\nPeople who are ""questioning"" often can\'t easily put into words what they\'re questioning or how they feel. I would say to you that all three of the perspectives I offered can and often do result in people acting the same, all using the term ""queer"" to describe themselves put do not at all agree on the meaning, and would find huge grounds for disagreement - and that given Queer Theory\'s definition of what ""queer"" means (defined as ""resistance to regimes of the normal""), the vast and overwhelming amount of people are *not* queer. Rather, it\'s incredibly popular now for people to be ""questioning"" for a variety of reasons.']"

TERFs and skeptics of various kinds love to talk about these changes being irreversible, and they sort of are, but they can also be disguised with binders, shaving, voice training, etc.  So with a low-dose HRT regimen, you might reach a point where it is easy to pass as either of the traditional western genders depending on how you dress, speak and carry yourself.\n\nAlso worth noting that ""nonbinary"" can look like anything - androgynous, masculine or feminine.  Lots of nonbinary folks have gender dysphoria that recedes when their body changes.  Others don\'t.  If you\'re considering HRT, I would think about it in terms of what concrete changes you would like to see.  If you want some changes but not others, you may be able to design an HRT treatment plan that would reduce the likelihood of some things (e.g. taking T along with finasteride to reduce changes in hair growth patterns).

259,I need help to identify my gender.,"So, it's a long story, at the age of 10 met with an accident and my dick was circumcised.

These feelings are strong now, I don't want a vagina now(atleast not now). But I do want to dress like a girl, behave like a girl. I always imagine how life would be if I was someone's wife. I also have sexual desires like a girl. One day I was thinking of trying to earn money to go through a surgery to look more feminine, and then getting married to a man.

If I was born a man, and am comfortable presenting masculine, how can I be NB? Because that\'s what makes me feel good, feel right about myself.

Maybe you\'re an effeminate man, maybe you\'re just ""gentle"".\n\nFor me I have a masculine and feminine side. I\'ve transitioned as best I could. I don\'t pass and most people see me as a man no matter how I dress or do my hair. \n\nThe reason I came out so late in life is because I couldn\'t imagine changing everything I liked my bottom half. Later I learned what non-binary was. Also genderfluid. Sometimes I\'m her, other times I\'m him and I don\'t always have control over it.\n\nThe best way for you to find out, if it\'s safe for you to do so, is try different names, different clothes and pronouns and see what feels right for you.\n\nI have found the best way for me to be my real self is to chase the euphoria. So find what feels good and just do more of that. When you find something that feels bad, or makes your skin crawl, take note and belive yourself. \n\nEven though you thought of yourself as a him, im sure there are many masculine interests that don\'t work for you, the same will be true if your a her. I\'ve now met several thems. Wherever you end up is fine as long as it\'s right for you.\n\nHope that helps.']"

Well, the person printed my library card with the feminine version of my name, and I just find it funny.

I only ever go by my (gender-neutral) nickname, never by my full name, but I usually just fill out my fully legal name on forms because I haven't changed it and don't want to cause trouble. I've never had anyone switch up the gender of it by changing the ending before, this is a first for me, but I rather like it.

280,I don't know how to write NB characters,"**Tw/Cw: talking about NB stuff from a cisgender perspective. Just in case**

I want to start writing NBs but I'm cis and have gone thru years of questioning and unlearning the things that are socially perpetuated for my gender. I feel like because I've went through that process, I've become very comfortable with being cis with maybe some genderfluid tendencies. As for writing, I don't publish or upload my work anywhere, I just write for myself; For the most part, my NB characters I've explored with are generally just characters who only happened to be NB rather than having an NB experience. This is changing a bit now that I'm exploring with a character named Herb (breaking an NB/Gq sin by making them non-human. Humanoid, but non human nonetheless).

>Some context on Herb: Herb was born afab in a traditionalist society. They were dissatisfied with being afab but were too busy with their business and family life to really explore. They are tragically betrayed on the job and reincarnate. Herb then lives the next centuries exploring themselves (and their gender). They're happily NB now.

My biggest questions/concerns are: 1) the erasure of the real traumas/struggles of being a man/woman vs erasure of the struggles of being NB. There's so much struggle being either or and I don't know if I should make Herb be somewhat of a commentary on women's struggle or be the story of an NB.

And 2) I'm just confused. I'm so used to thinking in lenient binaries with my beliefs being that your biology dictates your gender but your biology shouldn't dictate what you can do (ie. Being a male nurse or being a female blacksmith); Trans people also fit in this binary and are an ""exception"" to the whole biology=gender. At some point I paid no mind of NB/Gq given my own genderfluid stuff but I'm thinking myself in circles when I really think about it. If things are inherently genderless, then what am I doing with Herb? 


All perspectives and criticism is accepted",y8jyxw,10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/y8jyxw/i_dont_know_how_to_write_nb_characters/,"[""> I'm so used to thinking in lenient binaries with my beliefs being that your biology dictates your gender\n\nI think that's your main issue right there, and why trying to wrap your head around NB experiences is causing confusion- biology doesn't dictate gender in the slightest. Primary sexual characters are *gendered*, but they don't dictate a person's gender. The way trans people experience gender isn't inherently different from the way cis people experience gender, either. The difference between a cis and a trans person is just that a cis person identifies as the gender they were raised as (or assigned at birth), while a trans person doesn't. The obvious question then is, if gender isn't biology then what is it? And that's a question that doesn't really have a single, widely agreed upon answer. Every genderqueer person ends up with their own answer to that question. I don't really have a satisfactory answer myself.\n\n> I don't know if I should make Herb be somewhat of a commentary on women's struggle or be the story of an NB.\n\nThere is a LOT to be said about women's struggles and genderqueer struggles and how they intersect and how they differ, but ultimately it comes down to: is Herb a woman? If Herb is a non-binary women, then the answer is that it should be *both,* not one or the other. (If the idea of a nonbinary woman confuses you, I'd suggest not writing Herb as one.) If Herb isn't a woman, then don't write them as one. Let their story just be the story of a NB person."", 'I think there\'s a degree to which any author can only write well when they write from their own experience. This doesn\'t mean that you need to be NB in order to write good NB characters, nor does it mean that NB people can automatically write good NB characters. But you do need to find a way to connect your characters to something that you have personally experienced.\n\nEven if you are NB, you only live your own experience and NB people are very diverse, and as such you will end up depicting NB people inaccurately if you only write about your own personal experience with gender. So how do you fill in the gaps?\n\n* Listen to more nonbinary people about their experience. ""Writing from your experience"" can include writing about the experiences of people whose lives you have intimate familiarity with. These people can even be strangers, such as if you read an in-depth personal account online and reflect on it deeply.\n* Relate aspects of your experience to aspects of NB people\'s experience. For example, most NB people experience some degree of ambivalence to gender identity, like we may identify partly with our assigned birth gender but at other times identify partly with the opposite binary gender, but neither fully fits. Or others feel varying level of attachment to gender, like we may identify as a woman or a man to a degree, sometimes, but then at other times we feel really detached from gender and don\'t want much to do with it. Even if you haven\'t experienced this sort of thing with gender, most people at some point have felt like they straddled some group or category or identity as being ""sort of in it but sort of not"". Maybe try to relate some of your experiences of ambivalence in identity or inclusion in a group, and then you can develop more of an intuition for writing NB characters who feel this.\n\nAs for your question (1) about trauma, my personal take on this is that I am tired of reading about NB people experiencing trauma around gender. I have my own trauma around gender, and most NB people have varying degrees of it too. I get frustrated that there is a degree to which both NB people and trans people (these groups overlap) tend to be characterized in the public consciousness, by our trauma. My life has largely been a journey of processing and overcoming trauma, and I\'ve done a pretty good job of it to where most of my daily life is happy and self-actualizing. I feel pretty safe in the relationships and structures I navigate on a daily basis, and my struggles with gender these days are minor. I also take a lot of joy in being nonbinary, and I also have gained a lot of insight and overall have experienced life more richly because of it. I would really love to see more works, both fiction and nonfiction, that depict and focus on these positive aspects of NB experience. So, I\'m not saying to ignore trauma, but just, try to balance it with uplifting messages so that the story isn\'t too much of a downer. I like reading works where I see people struggling with things and then overcoming them and experiencing joy and wonder and all sorts of positive things, and I think in general LGBTQ people have struggled with this for decades now because of the cultural associations with LGBTQ people with unwholesomeness, manifesting in things like the ""bury your gays"" trope, and NB and trans people are no exception to this. It\'s a major gap in representation so I recommend getting familiar with the negative biases in LGBTQ depiction in general, then getting familiar with the biases specific to NB and trans people (i.e. over-focusing on dysphoria, trauma, and negative experiences) before you start really diving into writing.\n\nAs for your second question, my intuition is that you need to talk to more trans people. Like whon you say this:\n\n> Trans people also fit in this binary and are an ""exception"" to the whole biology=gender.\n\nThis seems like something someone would say if thye haven\'t talked to, and really listened to, the experiences of a lot of trans people. Even the binary trans people I\'ve talked to, tend to have a messy and complicated relationship to gender. It is an inherent part of being trans.\n\nI would also want to encourage you, though, by saying that if you are confused, *this is itself part of the experience of trans and nonbinary people*. Don\'t shy away from the confusion, embrace it. Like if you hang around this community you will find tons of confusion. People are constantly asking: ""Am I nonbinary/trans or am I just frustrated with gender roles?"" or ""Am I really nonbinary / trans if I share the following experiences in common with cis people and don\'t resonate with the typical nonbinary / trans person\'s narrative?"" or ""What even is gender identity? I don\'t think I feel any distinct sense of gender identity."" (This viewpoint is especially common in agender people or people with agender-adjacent identities.) It\'s confusing. If you want to accurately depict NB and trans people\'s experiences, you need to really embrace this confusion.']"

I(25 AFAB) have been having questions about my gender since early highschool and have had them on and off since then. I am finally at a point in my life where I feel like I can start a serious journey to figure out what I am and how to relieve some of my dysphoria. I guess I am just looking for some feedback to from people who might know what I'm going through. 

I have recently come to terms with  the fact that at the very least I am not Cis. There are things about being a female that appeal to me, like being a mother and stuff, but in my everyday life I want so badly to be male or at least masculine. The problem is I go back and forth so often between the two it makes it hard to figure out what I really am. I would love to be either one or the other . Some weeks I want to be masc, other days im okay and enjoy being a bit more femme and girly, but to me being femme sometimes feels like a performance, like dress up. I feel more confident and settled so to speak when looking more masc, but even then sometimes it feels like I'm just pretending, and nobody would take me seriously. In my day to day I don't even think about my gender, but whenever attention is brought to it and how I look female... It makes me feel icky. I get dysphoric about my body more often these days too, like most of the time I am ambivalent or down right disgusted by my chest and more have started to bind more often. And the idea of having more masculine features is super appealing (I'm terrified of making permanent changes to my body however, what if I change my mind?)

The idea of me being gender fluid has recently come up and I am considering it. I have already come out to a few trusted friends and my partner about my gender problems and they are supportive.

I have even found books oriented towards depression and/or anxiety, such as the books by David Burns, to have ideas that are equally able to be applied to gender-related thoughts.

But in these situations, the problem isn't the sharing of assigned birth sex, the problem is the bigotry.\n\nI think being able to share this information is important. I have a ton of instances where it is highly relevant, at least when talking about my own experience. I was raised as a boy and my experiences were shaped by this. I also then lived a good portion of my adult life as a man, and my experiences were further shaped by this. I only really started exploring my nonbinary identity in my mid 30's, only started living and self-expressing the way I want to around the age 37-38 and I'm now 42.\n\nI pretty much *cannot* talk about the discrimination I faced on the basis of my unusual experience of gender, without revealing that I am AMAB. Although I do share quite a few things in common with AFAB nonbinary people (and if necessary, could hide my assigned birth gender in a discussion, and focus only on points of similary or shared / common experience), these things represent a relatively small portion of the struggles I've felt with gender. Most of the struggles come specifically down to being raised / socialized as male, and/or being gendered male by others and treated in specific ways that people gendered female are not treated.\n\nThere are whole aspects of my experience that are important to me, such as the intense loneliness I felt in the first several years out of college, my ambivalent relationship to feminism, my experience of being sexually assaulted, and my profound discomfort with some of the ways in which left-wing culture started changing in the 2010's and how that introduced conflicting pressures that clouded my journey to explore my gender identity and express it the way I would ideally want to, that I cannot discuss in anything beyond the most shallow level without revealing my assigned birth gender.\n\nI get really uncomfortable though if someone *asks* someone's assigned birth sex except in rare cases where it is relevant. Even if it is relevant, I need a reasonable degree of trust that the person asking (and anyone else present) does not harbor significant sexism and/or transphobia, for the question to feel comfortable. Giving how prevalent subtle transphobia is in our society, how prevalent anti-male sentiment is in left-wing circles, and how prevalent misogyny is in right-wing circles, there are very few circumstances (i.e. outside small private conversations with a few close friends) where these sorts of questions come across as truly comfortable.\n\nSo yeah, basically I think it's important to give people the freedom to share or not share this information as they deem necessary.""]"
291,I don't think I'm a man anymore,"I'm sorry if this gets long, I have a lot of stuff stuck in my head that I need to get out! The TL;DR version is: I've been living as a trans man for years and now I think I'm just genderqueer and want to change some things accordingly but am quite scared! 

So I'm 27 years old. At 18 I started to really question my gender, and ended up identifying as non-binary until I was around 22. At that point I was identifying more as a trans man, and when I turned 23 I started taking testosterone. A couple of years later I also had top surgery. Fast forward to about a year ago, aged 26, I started getting little feelings of discomfort and questioning and also adopted the genderqueer label alongside the trans man label. For the past year the thought of ""shit I'm not actually a man"" has popped up time and time again. I have moments where I regret taking testosterone, moments where I really miss my birth name, moments where I wish I could present differently. It's all been really scary and disorienting and all I can hear is my mother's voice in my head saying ""just you wait, you'll regret all of this"" (my family were very very unsupportive at the start and are still only marginally supportive). Overall I don't think I actually regret what I've pursued so far, but sometimes I just wonder how things might've been if I'd not gone down the path I have.

I've been putting a lot of thought into it all lately and at the moment my main conclusion is that I think I'm just genderqueer. I don't think I'm a man. I'd like to experiment with my presentation, I'd like to come off testosterone, I'd like to use my middle name- which is a nickname of my birth name, and I'd like to potentially experiment with pronouns. All of this feels very scary though, and I feel very limited in what I can actually do. 

I couldn't handle having to go through a whole other process of coming out and changing things up with my family or my job. I don't plan to change anything there and hope I can find enough comfort and happiness through just implementing some little changes in my personal life (with my girlfriend, some friends, my online pals)

I guess I just wanted to tell a group of people who just might understand where I'm coming from. I'd also love to hear from any people who took testosterone for years and then came off it. I'm curious about how much will change and if it will affect how I'm perceived much. I have a general idea of what reverts and what is permanent but some real-life experiences might be helpful to hear.

302,Online-Only Friendships & Gender Fluidity,"I have a friendship that is 99.9% of the time online-only with someone who is identifying as agender. 

We've talked about their journey a lot, and I have come to the realization that I have not been as good of an ally as I would like to be. 

They switch between which pronouns they prefer, and they don't know which pronouns are the wrong one to be used until the wrong pronoun is used. I kept using the wrong pronouns and was not corrected by either friend or their spouse, which led to the friend feeling really invalidated. Friend's gender presentation does not align with their preferred pronoun at any given time (totally fine - no one owes anyone a 'matching' presentation of gender to their pronouns), and when I have misgendered friend, it was to their spouse (who *didn't* correct me, and actually echo'd *back* the same pronouns I used to refer to friend).

The majority of the time, our friendship is on an instant messaging app that does not have the ability to showcase which gender pronouns someone prefers (let alone which gender is the correct gender of the day). 

I went through our conversation history, and I completely understand why friend feels invalidated. I have done my best to be supportive (linking to Etsy pride flags for the gender identity I was aware of before being told ""That's not my identity. That was a fleeting identity. I'm agender now,"" backing up friend about their experience being valid & absolutely real when Internet trolls tried to tell them there was no such thing as agender/genderfluid/demigender, and sympathizing about how frustrating it can be to figure out hairstyles/clothing options/binders when ones gender can just...fluctuate at any given time).

I think it is pretty easy in Spanish since it is a Romance language and it is easy to call back to Latin for appropriate gender neutral language that feels organic to the language. When native speakers call me out I simply provide citations to queer Spanish language publications written by native Spanish speakers that call for these changes already.', 'i think it makes total sense that you use different pronouns in different languages, for me i realized that using they/them pronouns in english felt really easy since you don\'t really have to gender every single word but in spanish using elle (gender neutral pronoun) was a constant battle of trying to ""educate"" people on the pronouns and outing myself all the time in situations where i didn\'t feel ready.   \nusing gender neutral pronouns in spanish is very new and it\'s also very exclusive to a specific class (not a lot of people know about/there\'s not a lot of info about it) so i personally don\'t use elle in spanish, just el (he/him) which makes it easier for the people around me/elders/my family. i just accepted it and realized sometimes my pronouns are not the most important part of my gender identity, it\'s the love/listening people show me throughout my tranistion.']"

2.I am aztistic and I frequently don't finde the words to express myselfe the right way and can missunderstand intentions.

Questions: 

Do I even belonge with the Queercommunity if I pass as cis and heteronormative? 
If I do, should I be more oviously queer? 
How do you (fellow complicated, non oviiusly lgbtqia+ introverted being) make yourself feel like you belong with the community?

Background:

The one thing I always been sure about myselfe is that I am not straight. 
I questioned my gender only one time, in 2. Grade, but it was explained with me just being not ""traditional"" girly girl and that I liked to play with boys and diden't understand the girls diden't mean I was ""mabye a boy soul in the wrong body?"". My wording as an 7 year old when my dad explained to me that gay ppl and trans ppl exist. ( I was raised very esoterical new age. Some things where veery christian and very f*ed up, and some things pretty liberal. )
 
I like my body and I never had genderdisphorya. At least I don't think so. But when puberty came I rapidly grew in to something that in the words of a theater director was ""unable to pass as a boy even if you grew a beard, hony"".
And sexualisation proofed the point to me. Since god asigned this body to me, I there for am a woman right? A Bisexual one, but a woman. Who wants to have babies cuz that would make dad happy and me a better woman. 

A lot of realization about the parts of my upringing I diden't want to reflect up on have cought up with me since last year. 

Now I am a female presenting, afab nonbinary/agender, autistic stay at home mother married to a male presenting amab nonbinary/agender working dad.

307,Am I too old for this? How to navigate.,"I'm 37 AFAB. I grew up in a super religious family. I'd call it a cult because I was definitely indoctrinated. We didn't discuss sex and gender other than to say gays went to hell etc. You get it. 

Always, growing up, I was miserable with girly things. Never had an interest in the things most girls do. Thought maybe I was a tomboy, but that never felt right either. When puberty hit, things only got worse. I self harmed a lot. I hated my breasts and hips. It's been a source of severe depression all my life. I am a 2x suicide attempt survivor. 

At 29, I came out as bisexual to my spouse (who I married right out of high school). Actually, we sort of spontaneously came out to each other. He is a pansexual cis male and incredibly supportive. My kids (16 and 14) are as well. 

I am an author for a living. This is relevant because I've always struggled to identify with and write female points of view. I find it much more mentally comfortable to write male characters. It never occurred to me that all these things could be related until I read an autobiography by a trans friend (mtf) and fellow author. She described gender dysphoria in her book and it sounded exactly like how I felt! 

Cue almost 2 years of soul searching. I knew I wasn't trans. I don't want to be male. I just want to be me. I am neither. Both. It's kinda complicated... Which is how I settled on defining myself as genderqueer about 6 months ago. 

I cried the first time I put on a binder. It wasn't perfect but it was so much better. 

I'm scared of further changes though a part of me wants them. I've started to discreetly look into things like maybe trying a different name (my current name is a very common very female name I have always hated.) I'd gladly just have my breasts removed if I could. I'd love to have a less feminine shape to my body, so maybe testosterone? Idk. I'm scared of that because I live deep in a rural red state and if anyone knew, I might not be safe or my kids could get harassed at school.

But I'm so old... I wish I'd known all this when I was younger. Is it too late to ask people to learn a new name? Too late to think about hormones? Surgery? Did I miss my window to be who I was supposed to be? How do I do all this at my age?

310,Questioning my gender identity,"So, I (14 AFAB) have been questioning my gender identity for about- I think two years now, and used to identify as bigender, going by he/she pronouns and at one point he/him  (only online because I'm terrified to talk to someone irl about stuff like that) before questioning that I may be something else instead. Like, I'm fine going by she/her, but I really just feel like I kind of resonate with he/they more and would love to go by those pronouns and dress masculine or androgynous rather than present/dress feminine. But I know my mom probably wouldn't like the idea of me trying on boy clothes and stuff like that, which sucks because I really want to. Also, like I said before, I don't mind she/her. I'm okay with my AGAB but I want to go by a more masc or gender neutral name and use different or all pronouns or just switch between pronouns at different times.

 I sometimes feel a bit dysphoric (?) and think I would rather feel better off as a male or have both fem and masc features but look more masc leaning I guess(?) I'm not sure tbh, I'm obviously still trying to figure things out, so idk right now. Also, whenever I draw my persona or picture myself in my head while daydreaming, I usually draw or imaginate a guy/androgynous person that has female genitalia (just felt like I should clarify that part).

312,Gender Curious Kiddo,"Full disclosure I‚Äôm cisgendered male parent of a gender curious child‚Ä¶and this is a rant:

I‚Äôm so tired of adults gendering my kiddo.  They‚Äôre almost three and are internalizing peoples guesswork.  At two my kiddo said they want to us to use and advocate for others to use they/them pronouns and we‚Äôre all for it.  I Love my kid for being who they are.  They‚Äôre getting confused about whether they have to choose being a boy/girl because people at parks, grocery stores, you name it just guess and don‚Äôt ask.  I was just in a place that has an ‚Äúall genders‚Äù welcome sign up where the owner just straight up guessed about my kids gender.  When I reminded them it‚Äôs best practices to ask when you don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶and if you‚Äôre guessing because you haven‚Äôt asked or been told yet, you don‚Äôt know.  They got (predictably) defensive and advised me that my kid needs a pin to let others know.  We have a pin. They don‚Äôt always want to wear it or broadcast, a lot of times they just want to be themselves.  They get upset when people gender them, understandably so.  As their advocate I beat myself up about how I wasn‚Äôt convincing enough or gave off the vibe that I‚Äôm just some stereotypical cis-man that can‚Äôt handle their kid being trans.

I'm a 24 y.o. guy/non-binary person (he/they pronouns) and recently I've been wanting to wear bras to affirm my more feminine side. 

Any recommendations for where I can go to get measurements done? Or good websites? I've never done this before and might want to be discreet about it.

Thanks!!",xiylun,36,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/xiylun/bra_recommendations/,"[""I recommend visiting /r/ABraThatFits and measuring yourself using [the sub's own calculator](https://abrathatfits.org/calculator.php). Both the sub and the calculator are gender-inclusive, and people of all genders are welcome.\n\nA lot of bra brands have size guides or calculators that tell you to add 4 inches to your underbust measurement, which puts people in bras with bands that are too big and cups that are too small. It give people the incorrect idea that A cup = tiny, B = small, C = average, D = large, and DD = enormous, which is definitely not the case. Cup size just indicates how much difference there is between your underbust and bust measurements. A = 1 inch, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, DD = 5, etc.\n\nWhen you're ready to try some bras, a lot of people like Amazon's Prime Wardrobe option that lets you try things on before you commit to buying them. There's also /r/braswap where people sell or trade their gently-used bras, and /r/randomactsofbras where people give away bras."", ""Bra sizing is the one consisten women's sizing thing! You can look up what the measurements mean online and do it yrself no problem! Just need a measuring tape.

Some ppl have more far apart, or facing in/out, etc, and you'd think it wouldn't be an issue for smaller titties but unfortunately it's even more of an issue bc big titty moves more, if it's mostly muscle it's going to be where it is. \n\nI would say- if you are uncomfortable being really brave which tbh most cis women are!!! Uncomfortable digging bras just in public w workers there helping!!! It might be helpful to get a few cheap sports bras from like Walmart and mark where on the bra your titties sit, see how and where different bands and strap styles sit, etc, and then compare to regular molded cut styles you see in the store. \n\nAs far as safety goes: if you live in a rural area or somewhere unsafe in generally you need to talk to local queer community peeps, they can help. Otherwise i would suggest calling up a local specialist boutique and asking if they are trans inclusive before going in, and then taking a friend if they are. Generally the local specialist shops will have really broad sizing, know where to order anything under the sun, can help with pretty much anything-- and also have seen everyone in  50 mi radius topless without much incident. Usually they are pretty cool!! They also usually are the ppl serving us suspiciously large titty folk and also the mastectomy peeps, uneven titties, and also your local drag queens! \nIf you do not have a cool shop like this (or their inclusiveness is questionable) i would suggest going to your local big box store with more than one female presenting friend, or at least one mom presenting friend üòÇ. I work for Walmart and we do not have any weird rules about clothes trying on but obviously in many places it's not the company but the humans that are dangerous.

It's an umbrella term that covers both gender non Conforming people (fem men, masc women, cross dressers, etc) and non-cis people. It is, essentially, the queering of gender (cishet norms, identities, and presentations).\n\nI've noticed that over the last few years people have been insisting that Genderqueer is a flavour of non-binary. These people are not only wrong, but they're erasing queer history and many people's identity. Got into an argument with an ally at Pride who insisted that I'm trans.

You can find a lot of these folks in queer communities and you are more than welcome to tell people ""you aren\'t sure yet"" if they ask questions.\n\nThere\'s no rush to find the perfect term to encapsulate your feelings about gender and it\'s not a problem if a word that fits now turns out now to fit later - explore your feelings for what they are, try to find people with similar feelings, and the words will sort themselves out :) These terms are mainly used to find other people like us, after all!\n\nHappy exploring!', 'I\'m AFAB and identified as a cis woman for most of my life.

Having my ovaries and uterus out helped my health issues, but it also substantially helped with my dysphoria. Now that my health is stable I\'ve been exploring my relationship with gender and sexuality and have been identifying as pansexual and more or less NB or genderqueer.\n\nI made some calls to my local queer organizations to discuss all this, and to figure out how to get my T covered. I take estrogen and progesterone but I didn\'t truly feel like I was me until I added in a slightly high dose of T. That kind of solidified in my mind that I\'m not really a cis woman. And after talking to a trans woman and nonbinary person I feel pretty good about identifying as such.

331,Questioning Myself,"This is just an intro post for me in this community. I recenty learned there's a way to identify when you're not sure about your own gender. I was born female. I was always encouraged with girly things, but I really liked just having fun with the neighbor boys and dressing without taste. lol

When puberty hit, I started having questions. I lost my mom at a young age, so I never really had the talk. I didn't understand my own downstairs, but I seriously thought for a while like I was meant to have a penis. My imagniation certainly thought so. When I learned more about LGBT topics, I thought I might be a lesbian (later, I thought it might be bisexuality) and asked my sister, who knew a lot more than I did and had many friends in the community. (Side note: I later found out she was also a member and we openly talk about a lot more than when I was younger.) She told me it was okay to question, but I never felt like I knew what questions to ask. 

Currently, I'm 29 years old with a cis male spouse. He's stated he understands and he's aware that I identify as queer (mostly ace, but not sure I'm cis). We have lots of friends who are all over the gender and sexuality spectrums. I think I convinced myself I would do best being female and left it at that. But I still have questions. 

Am I transgender?
Do I have something wrong?
Am I just confused?

I am comfortable with my femininity now, but I feel like there's a masculline side that I've been neglecting for years. I've always related more to men than women, but I felt ashamed that I wasn't trying harder. 

Please advise and let me know where I should start because there's so much information out there (which is amazing to think about), but I don't know where to begin or even interpret what's going on with my own identity.",xbwp5g,25,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/xbwp5g/questioning_myself/,"['There is nothing wrong with you at all!

I'm thinking of limiting our in person contact if she can't honour these requests.

Context:

End of last year, I told my mom my pronouns and asked if she could use them, as well as gender neutral language when referring to me.
She said ""I have no problem with that""

I assumed she meant that she would respect my request, but whenever I saw her, she'd use my given pronouns and continued using gendered language. She get upset and frustrated when I suggest alternatives in the moment. 

When I confronted her and confirmed my request extea explicitly, she said she won't use my pronouns, and she will continue using gendered language for me. 
She acknowled that this was important, and important for me, but she said she wanted to prioritize her own comfort.

She's also assured me that she respects me, accepts me, and supports me 120% for who and ""what"" I am.

She's said that if I let this disagreement get between us, it's my fault for pushing her away. 

I feel hurt and betrayed and trapped. I hate being around her and hearing her say the words that now feel so foreign to me. 

I also feel like I need to, for once, stand up for myself.

341,Exploration Station - Would love some advice or discussion,"Hello!

I have some questions regarding gender identity and I‚Äôm not sure where to go. I‚Äôll give you some background and who I am and share advice or have a discussion.

I‚Äôm 23 years old and have felt very comfortable in my male body until the past couple of months. Several years previously I lifted weights every day and had a male body that I love, but now those same muscles are increasingly unattractive; my back and arms are too big, I have no defined hips, and my butt is flat and small. Fem clothing makes me feel empowered and happy, but that‚Äôs what has brought along these feelings of disappointment in my figure.

Been experimenting with the aforementioned fem clothing and makeup. Also, I have hair (been growing since the start of covid) reaching down my back that I love to style and let loose. I live with very supportive people where I can happily express myself. I feel very comfortable in these clothes but get anxious when people outside my circle come to visit. I‚Äôll wear a little eyeliner and maybe some light lipstick when I go out and that feels great. I live in a rural area, but it is close to a big university. I struggle with how my presentation changes how others may treat me and will dress to avoid stares. Never have lived in a city and don‚Äôt plan on living in one permanently.

As for sexuality I never had to give it much thought. Hook up with men occasionally but never am emotionally attracted. Have always felt more emotional connections with women and generally relate to them more. To be honest I‚Äôve never had high opinions of most men, but that can probably be applied to all people.  

I had a great relationship with my therapist when I was dealing with anxiety. She specialized in trauma, which I didn‚Äôt know I had, and would pinpoint experiences in my life that make up who I am today. She gave me the tools I needed to overcome feelings of inadequacy. She suspected that I may have bpd but never got tested, as eliminating weed from my life and therapy sessions leveled things out. Still deal with anxiety but with lesser magnitude and frequency. 

Right now I plan on taking yoga classes to hopefully shape my body more in line with what I want. Also plan on reaching out to my old therapist and relating these feeling. Thinking that down the line I‚Äôll consider hrt if it‚Äôs for me. What else can I do to gauge my feeling on gender identity?",x7pb9r,6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/x7pb9r/exploration_station_would_love_some_advice_or/,"['Im actually an amab insovidual questioning my gender too!

Not everyone feels the need to label themselves and many gender diverse people just get on with life and don't really care that they don't 100% fit their assigned gender. I was probably like that for a long time, plus I go through phases of feeling more fem so I could ignore it easier. But recently had a bit of an identity crisis and did some research and self exploration and found some labels that I like and feel fit me (for now). So I suggest you do a bit of googling. Remember labels are there to help you understand yourself and you don't have to use them. You can also interpret them in a way that works for you or come up with your own, change which ones you use or use as many as you like. Wishing you luck and happiness!""]"

347,Can I have some tips on getting a more femme hairstyle?,And maybe some general advice on how to look androgynous? Please and thank you,x5awve,62,10,https://i.redd.it/86mcr6fc0rl91.jpg,"['Use a hair band. There are both masculine and feminine hairband styles, so find one as masculine, feminine, or neutral as you want.', 'I would say in haircuts around cheekbone to jaw length, it‚Äôs common for more femme cuts to be shorter in the back (like a shortish stacked bob).', 'I would suggest parting it down the middle and tucking it back behind your ears or one ear which ever you feel more comfortable with. Also potentially adding some highlights to give your hair more dimension.', 'General hair notes : A lot can be done by just spending more time with your hair. Getting a trim to get rid of dead ends, regular brushing and parting, etc. You have gorgeously wavy hair, mine gets like that when its long. Brushing it brings out that wave so much more, and tends to look very femme. Another note is on fraying and frizziness, in that the ‚Äúsleeker‚Äù it looks (without getting oily), the more femme it often appears. Again, this is just general maintenance work; washing, brushing, even using some frizz-control oil (Just a drop! It does a lot, if you do use it).\n\nFor cutting options : As some other users have suggested, bobs are a great option for a more femme look. Your hair is naturally wavy, which looks really cute in a bob, or even curl it a bit. Or, straighten it. Theres really so many options, but overall, if you get it cut to a straight or angled bob, try to have it touch your shoulders when its straight, or hover just above. Its hard to tell if it‚Äôll touch from the photo, but if it doesnt, thats very much okay. The reason being, a bob cut to your chin when its straight, wont give you much ability to curl it and experiment with it, without it seeming a little too short. Another note: bangs are very femme, especially when they frame your face. That little wave you have off to the left in this photo is a good example, and is what I used to leave my bangs at, but it you want to change it up and go shorter, feel free to!\n\nFor hair styling : There are many many options, and you dont have to cut it. You dont even have to put in the work of curling or straightening it, just a good brushing. Determine where you want your part, and where your hair will let you part it. Brush it according to that part, and try to keep the part itself straight and neat. Determine if you want to try wearing your hair up or down, and again, if your hair will let you wear it up in a ponytail or bun (I unfortunately never could without bumps and wrinkles in my hair from my roots having their own opinions on what they wanted to do, so I never wore it up). If you want to straighten or curl it, and would need to get the equipment to do so, a thin flat iron is all you need to start. You dont have to get both, although its easier. Ive given my hair a bit more curl using a flat iron, just as much as Ive straightened it. \n\nFlat iron notes : When it comes to using one, start with a low temperature, and dont hold it in one spot for more than 3-5 seconds, tops, at least not until you‚Äôre comfortable with it. It will burn your hair to a crisp, just as much as if you left a strand on a red stove. Itll also burn your hands just as bad if you touch anywhere around the heating elements, even on the outside. Brush your DRY hair beforehand, and then use it almost like a brush. Clamp a little bit, by your roots, and pull it down and away in a slow, fluid motion. Repeat a couple times as necessary. If you want to use it to give some more curl, clamp the end, and roll it towards your head, wrapping the hair around the iron. If I remember correctly, you can just barely pinch the end of the iron without burning your fingers, to stabilize it, but I might be mistaken. If you try it, do so with caution and dont burn yourself please. Your hair does have layers to it, from the outermost layers that are the most visible, to the innermost that lay against your neck, so work your way through the layers. The heating element wont work as well if you clamp thick chunks, as the hair in the middle wont be exposed to the heat as much. \n\n\nFor general appearance tips : Your hair will do a lot to work towards androgyny. Each person has their own idea of androgyny, and personally, I like to aim towards Confusion. If you cant tell with a single glance if Im masculine or feminine, and I SEE that moment of confusion cross your face, I feel Ive won lol. (Mini rant/explanation : Society still thinks in a binary mindset. People either look masculine or feminine, to most people. To appear truly androgynous is to break out of that binary picture, and in my mind, its inevitable to cause confusion, bc then, you cant be easily put into one category or the other). But, androgyny is to each person‚Äôs interpretation, and your interpretation of it is the most important for you. My recommendation here is to wear some subtle makeup, just foundation and mascara. Clean up your eyebrow lines. And for clothing, throw on a t-shirt and open flannel, or hoodie (while generally matching the colors of each, so for this shirt, maybe stay away from red outerlayers). Throw on some pants and shoes and youre good to go. \n\nAgain. Experiment until you find something you like and are comfortable with. I hope this lends some good ideas and helpful tips :)', 'Definitely look into styling your hair. Pinterest can give you some inspiration, but simply straightening or curling it will show you care a little more. Growing it out more will give you more options for styling as well.', 'Maybe try putting it up if you can?', 'Try straightening it with a hair straightener or just a brush and hair dryer.

You\'ll be able to do a lot with your natural texture.', ""I recommend putting in some layers. Maybe shorten it up a little in the back, but start with layers.

Not only does it explain a lot of terms but shows how there are _separate_, _independent_ spectra for things like identity, presentation, sexuality, romantic orientation, etc.\n\nGender identity is what you are inside, how you see yourself, regardless of what you were assigned at birth, or how you present.\n\nNon-binary is a gender identity, not a particular type of _presentation_. In the widest sense, it means ""neither exclusively male nor female"". There are enbies who present masc, enbies with beards, enbies who present androgynously, enbies who present femme, muscular enbies, genderfluid enbies, and all kinds of other permutations. Arguably agender, bigender, and other folks are part of the ""non-binary spectrum"". So you could be non-binary and agender (no gender identity), or non-binary and genderfluid sometimes feeling more femme and other times feeling masc, agender, or some _other_ non-binary identity.\n\nPresentation (how you dress/appear) is not always the same to identity, for various reasons. It can be unsafe to present the way you actually identify sometimes, or there could be other pressures or reasons (financial, emotional, psychological etc.) preventing someone from presenting the way they want to or identify.\n\n""Bisexual"" has historically meant having some kind of attraction both to people who are the same gender as you, and people who are not. For example, if you are non-binary, this could include attraction to other enbies and women/femme people. There are a lot of special cases under ""bisexual"" that have more particular constraints (e.g. ""pansexual"" generally meaning attraction _regardless_ of gender).\n\nBased on your description, it doesn\'t sound like you are attracted to all non-binary people. It sounds like you might be mostly(?) attracted to people who are presenting somewhere on the femme side, regardless of their gender identity or genitals, which is totally fine. Personally, I would describe this as ""bisexual"" with a preference for femme presentation in partners. Presentation preference exists among both straight and queer folks; presentation they are attracted to is separate from their sexual and gender identities. Read about ""the Futch Scale"" as an example particularly discussed in lesbian culture.\n\nWho _you_ are attracted to doesn\'t necessarily have any implications for _your_ gender identity (which could be non-binary or anything else), nor does presentation (liking/desiring to wear bras). However, it is a very common experience in trans circles (which includes non-binary people, as ""trans"" means ""different than assigned gender"") for folks to think they are _just_ attracted to something and later realize ""oh wait, I want to look like that"".

My just below the pectoral measurement is 34"" and 38"" band size fits me best. Due to having some muscular pectoral definition I\'m an A cup (AA would just be ribs) and I find a padded bra gives the illusion I have at least B cups when wearing a loose, but in my size women\'s vest top.\n\nA well fitting padded bra will do wonders to make your chest look more feminine and unless you want to look stand out sexy, you won\'t need further padding or forms unless you want your rack to genuinely compete with other women\'s and not just blend in with the majority of women wearing non-padded bras.\n\nA nicely padded bra can deceive people into thinking your A cups are more of a B or C cup. C cups are large enough to create a very feminine figure. My country\'s average cup size is a D cup, but that also correlates a bit with larger waist sizes, hence the average UK woman is a UK size 16.\n\nIf you\'re skinny and want to look feminine, then C cups will be enough breast form wise to give you that figure. For curvier people, D cups will be better. Obviously if you want to look like a sex bomb, then D cups and up are the way to go, but for a more modest life, C cups are more then adequate.\n\nA lot of padded bras won\'t work as well with breast forms due to the boosty lifted bit at the bottom of each bra cup, that pushes the breast tissue more up for extra cleavage. You could just try silicone fillets in a regular bra instead of tissue paper. I personally prefer either padded bras or breast forms over fillets though, but admittedly haven\'t tried fillets in a long time (women used to stuff chicken fillets in their bras to make their boobs look bigger, but now you can just buy silicone fillets that do the same thing without the salmonella issues).\n\nAlso for reference, the average female porn star is only a B cup. So if you\'re aiming to look like one of those young and pretty twenty something year old girls out on the town, then a quality padded bra will help you blend in more. It doesn\'t need to cost a lot. I got one from George ASDA which is owned by Walmart. Obviously actual mass there feels sexier, in which case breast forms or a breast plate will do, but those cost more and can get quite hot wearing and if you\'re trying to look feminine daily, you may not appreciate the extra mass there. For dates and feeling sexy, a nice set of breast forms or a breast plate are quite the confidence booster and get you a lot of positive attention.', ""Okay so it'll vary a bit but all you really need to start with I guess is the size around the chest (not including breasts, just across there) which is like the number bit so that it fits and is comfortable around your body.

363,what even is gender,"I have always believed I am a cis woman but one question has made me question everything. 

The question: outside of the social constructs of gender, how would you define feminity and masculinity?

And I have no response. This led to me thinking more in depth than I have thought in a long time, and came to the realization that I don't think I really see myself as a particular gender. I like my vagina, I like my titties, but I also wouldn't mind having a penis.

I remember times I've actually had sexy-time dreams but I was the man. I enjoy dressing feminine, I love dresses, but I also enjoy masculine clothes. If I were to wake up the next day in a male body I would be fine. But I don't want to change my body to be a man because I also am perfectly comfortable as a woman.

I by no means am discrediting those with gender dysphoria, but I cannot relate to wanting to be in a different body. I would be just as comfortable in a male body, but I also am happy with my female one.

If I'm fine the way I am, should I just not worry about it? Is this all normal?

364,"I don't know what I am, or if it even matters... TW: religious abuse, internalized misogyny, internalized homophobia, internalized transphobia, closeting, depression","Hello\~ I'm new here, and I've been questioning my gender identity for over a decade. I'm afab and grew up religious to some extent for most of my life; before I embraced my queerness, I went through a very troubling religious chapter of my life where I had a lot of internalized homophobia, misogyny, and transphobia. The latter wasn't fully realized until after I left my religion, and even then, it took a while to understand. I still am.

My problem is this: when I was religious, I struggled and suffered so much with a deep truth that I could never be enough as a ""woman."" I felt like some kind of humanoid trying to be a woman, an evil creature fitting into a box that just wasn't meant for me. I felt like I was destined for hell because my womanhood was constantly in question, was debilitated by my queerness, and I was just one wrong choice away from everyone finding me out. I was never at peace.

It was a very painful existence; after I left it all, I wondered if maybe my struggling was because, well... maybe I wasn't a woman. What a concept! I leaned into gender neutrality, but this transition proved much harder for those around me who acted like I was asking too much from them. I felt defeated, misunderstood, embarrassed, and gaslighted myself back into the closet. That was a decade ago.

Now I am in a much happier place with my identity, at least sexually - on the basis of gender, those closest to me watch me shy away from the possibility that I perhaps am not entirely comfortable with the concept of being seen as a woman. My friends have been wonderful in knowing that I'd probably feel better with them using they/them pronouns towards me, but I hesitate and get scared. I don't want to go through any of it again. And now I'm faced with my internalized gaslighting, and it's cruel: what if I'm not genderqueer, and instead my religious past just caused self-hatred towards my gender identity? If I am a woman, that's fine with me - if anything, perhaps a genderqueer woman. I'm just lost. I just want to know myself entirely, after everything that's happened in my life.

I'm seeing a therapist who's having a dialogue with me about this, so I'm not walking this journey alone. I'm also grateful to find this space.

366,demigirl?tomboy?or smth else?,"I have been questioning my gender here for quite a long time so, i wanted to ask for some advice. For the context im afab.

As a kid , I never liked dresses,heels,make up,shirts,nail polish,earrings, doing ur hair (ponytails,buns,braids etc) basically anything that is considered stereotypically feminine. It wasnt like a preference tho, as when my parents forced me to do this stuff and i'd look in the mirror, the person i saw wasnt ""me"", it felt so fake and almost like I had to play a play. I really didnt wanted to wear/do these things as it just felt so wrong (still applys to me)
Though, i never had too much problems when ppl would consider me to be a girl. It was well, ppl assume im one so i didnt know better. 

I am lucky enough to have a fairly small chest, as most ppl would see me as ""flat"" so i dont have alot of dysphoria abt my body. I have no problems with my genitelia either. Could maybe be cuz im asexual? Im pretty much sex repulsed so doing it with someone is pretty much out of picture, so ive never been really ""confronted"" with having afab genitalia, if you know what I mean. Even though my chest is small, i dont feel like my chest is like, mine?? Okay yeah, my chest is there, all cool and stuff, but idk if i can call it ""mine"", they are just kinda..there? I like to bind it tho, it makes me happy. In that way, i actually can call it ""my chest""

I have no problems with she/her pronouns (I go by any) but by now, being refered to as a girl in some cases feels so, weird. Like okay, ppl see me as one, fair enough but once ppl actually refer to me as one, it feels so fake? ""Young lady"" ""you are a pretty girl"" ""ma'am/madam"" ""you as a woman.."" like uhh? Youre talking abt ME? It didnt actually bothered me at first, but it does when I give it a second thought yk. Though, i have no problems when choosing toilets or when the P.E teacher says ""boys here, ladies there"" I mean, i have a female body so I guess I'd belong with the girls yk (plus, boys have to do more and i dont rlly like P.E) but yeah, i dont rlly have an internal struggle with that. Idk maybe im okay with being refered as a ""female"" cuz thats the sex, while girl is a gender. I really cant describe myself as a girl/female/woman etc without it feeling just, wrong. When i look at myself in the mirror while calling myself a girl, its just so ""ehhhh??!!"" So when I do have a choice, for example online, I like to refer to myself as rather a boy than a girl. Cuz when ppl refer to me as a boy (or at least, a non girl), it makes me comfortable. 

As a kid and still, i have always felt the need to ""prove"" myself on masculinity. Boys pee in bushes? I can do that too. Boys play with cars? I want cars too. (Idk why i thought this, but..) girls like cats and boys like dogs? I like dogs better. And so on. I always thought of myself as: im not like the other girls. Also, my interests are pretty ""masculine"" so i always felt a lil more connected when i was talking with boys. Like more the ""same"". Though, i never really related to guy characters when i was a kid on TV or books. I always related a bit better with the girl characters, especially the masc ones. Though, when I see boy characters now, i have this ""I kinda wishes I looked like you rn"" especially when they have characteristics of both a girl and a boy (boys with long hair, high pitched voice, feminine clothing style etc) Also, when i have to picture myself in the future, im not a woman. Im just not. Its always an androgyne person and sometimes a feminine boy kind of idea. 

My general feeling abt my gender is just: what is gender? How does gender feel like? Both appearance and pronouns dont define gender, so what IS gender??? The only reason why i ID as a girl is cuz ppl see me as one, not cuz I really ""feel"" like one. So idk, i dont have a strong sense of gender.

Because I'm in a single mind about it.

I hate it.

For 1, trans men and women fought way to hard to be called *men* and *women* without any damn quotation marks around the words and this kinda feels like that.

For 2, outside of those who dwell within the binary, can't help but notice there ain't a whole hecking lot of ""ejaculating bodies"" entering the public debate on this which stinks of just another way for the patriarchy to put its honking great unwanted boot down.

And lastly... Reducing us down to our constituent reproductive parts seems like the exact thing we're trying to get away from. It's just a new way of keeping binarism and it's making my skin crawl everytime I hear it.

That said... I honestly want to hear what various trans and enby people have to say on the matter... Because I ain't an expert or a voice for the people or anything.

371,Pronoun question,"This is more about me than a general question. I wondering if people differentiate between ""He/they"" vs ""He/him, They/them"". Because I kinda see it like He/they is where you prefer to switch in say, every other sentence- whereas He/him They/them is more like... sometimes you feel like a he/him and sometimes you feel like a they/them.

Idk, I was trying to figure out if I fall under the ace spectrum when I was reminded that my gender doesn't always feel wholly binary. I used get so frustrated at myself for not quite being able to get out ""trans boy"" or ""trans man"", until someone used the pronoun ""they"" sort of indirectly at me and I was like ""Oh. Nice."" I concluded that I just prefer the term trans masc.

It's not an everyday thing. A lot of time I prefer he/him pronouns. Occasionally it feels like somewhat of a grey area and I wouldn't mind using either one. Rarely, I don't really feel like anything and long for people to use they/them, kind of like I longed for people to use he/him when I first came out. I think that means I technically fall under the definition of demiboy, but idk how I feel about labeling myself as that. But I also don't know how I feel about just using the term queer, because that can mean a lot of things and it kinda feels like I'm hiding behind it so I don't have to come out again.

And see, I don't think I _can_ come out again. It took so goddamn long to get to here, it took five _years_ to get to the point where almost everyone in my life exclusively uses he/him pronouns for me, and I don't want to back pedal on that. I wouldn't even know how to bring it up.

I mean I do, but there's maybe like, two people who would understand and actually try. I just don't think it's worth it. It's not like I hate he/him pronouns either, no matter what I feel in the moment he/him is 1000x better than she/her. That might be because looking masc is the ultimate goal across the board. Even if I want to look androgenous, I want to be androgenous in a masculine way.... is that a thing?

373,Deeply questioning what it means to be a woman,"So I've been questioning my femininity and gender for the past month or so now. It's been completely disruptive in my life, and I have yet to find true peace in how I identify myself.

I've never had an ounce of doubt with my womanhood until recently. In fact, I've always embraced the feminine and found solace in the beautiful diversity that comes with being a woman. I know I've felt different, but that's only because I am a plus size Black woman who was raised around predominantly white people, who oftentimes where skinner and shorter than me. That would throw me off at times, but it never made me question my femininity or womanhood.

Lately, I've been feeling a little disconnected from my womanhood. I've been feeling like I'm not the same kind of woman as the women around me. Which is true, but I hate the idea of divorcing myself from womanhood overall. 

I do identify as a lesbian, and being with women and non-men has totally reshaped what it means to be a woman and how I embrace womanhood. It feels so good, but I still feel lost at times. 

I've been very protective of my womanhood in me going through this, as I feel like if I were to explore my expression, I would lose everything that I've done and have worked so hard for. I do acknowledge I have a ot of internalized misogyny, and maybe misandry. I don't want to stifle myself and I want to explore, but most of the time I just want to be a woman and not have to go through what I'm going through. 

I've been very sensitive towards gendered things lately, which I absolutely hate even admitting to, but I feel everything just feels so much, you know? The pressure to have an answer and be confident with it is strong, even though it's just putting that pressure on myself. 

I acknowledge that I seem pretty destination focused, and haven't been able to embrace the journey as it is. My therapist told me that things can be both and, not necessarily either or. Thinking that way has helped me embrace the different facets of what it means to be human, without having to sacrifice the things that bring me joy. It's been difficult to remind myself that, but it's helped me a lot.

380,gender crisis - I don't know how I feel and I never knew.,"hi!

I an having a total gender crisis and I want some advice. :D sooo:

I don't mind any pronouns, I don't feel much uncomfortable in my female body, only my long hair is a problem for me (hairdresser says short hair would not look good on me, but long hair just doesn't feel like me :/) and sometimes wearing dresses. 

I do not know if my gender is fluid or not. It's almost like I can be scared of some gender, so I just make up my mind about being a different gender. but I think I can never make me cis. I think so. so at the end of the day I don't know if I just hide my gender, so I feel different, or if I feel the same all the time. but to be true, I don't really know how I have felt before about gender. and also I feel more masc always when I am on my days, but I think that just happens, right?

I feel like I am both girl and boy, and then I think like NO? I am not anything, so agender? NO. I am everything. so pangender? NO. AM I JUST HIDING ME BEING TRANS? trans people have a different experience, I think. AM I JUST TOO CONFUSED AND I NEED TO FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT ON MY OWN, CAUSE THERE IS NOR A LABEL FOR THIS? probably. sometimes I am even scared that I am making all of thia up. cause that would probably be what my moz
ther would say about this. even labels I relate to, I just don't feel like it's me. 

its like the lack of knowing what gender is. its like being quiromantic, but with gender :D it's like being pangender and agender at the same time. it's like looking at the gender, that I have, through the dirtiest window on the planet. I do not feel the lack of gender, but I can't really describe what my gender is like. gender should be like an orchestra song. but I get only a chord. that sometimes sligthly changes. from D to D7. it should be like a collar, that everyone gets, with pattern. but I've got only colour, that changes. but I can't even see the colours, only others can.

382,How do I turn off the shame?,"Sorry this is long. There's a tl;dr at the bottom.

I'm 34, afab, genderqueer. I think I would most accurately say I'm transmasc but femme-- I love my jewelry and loud, colorful dresses; I just wish it read a little more like ""femme guy in drag"" than ""cis woman"", because my internal experience is very non-binary, more masculine. I've been ""out"" to a select group of friends and at my workplace for about a year. Terms like ""woman"", ""she"", etc. have never felt right for my entire life. I just never had words for it until recently.

I feel so much more liberated and authentically myself than I have ever felt in my entire life. My perception of myself makes sense for the first time in my three decades of being alive.  But I still feel this haunting shame in asking others to see me this way.

Maybe, like in the meme I posted a while back, it's because I'm neurodivergent? I have debilitating social anxiety and am on the spectrum-- I don't want to be an inconvenience, and my mind already tells me that everyone finds me unbearably irritating as it is.

It makes me not want to bring it up at all.  But people definitely notice that I don't shave, keep my hair short, and wear men's clothing a lot. I feel best with they/them pronouns, but I often don't want to tell or correct others, even though it bothers me to be misgendered.  I try to remember that being my most authentic self helps normalize it for others, but for some reason, I feel like others' comfort should take priority.

I grew up with zero awareness or context for people outside of the gender binary. My parents are homophobic and transphobic. It's not hateful words and acts, it's the little judgmental comments under the breath, but they'll still be nice to your face. They have otherwise been the most loving, supportive parents in the world, they are just really ""behind the times"" in that regard. Maybe I have some kind of internalized transphobia that's making me hate myself.

Because I had that anxiety about changing my name, I started by using the advanced search options in [this website](https://www.behindthename.com/names/search) to search for gender-neutral or masculine names that were phonetically similar to my old name. I ended up with a shortlist of names that seemed vaguely acceptable but none of them quite felt right. \n\nThen about a month later I was listening to a podcast and someone said that trans children should be allowed to experiment with their gender without pressuring them to get it ""right"" the first time, and even though I\'m not a child I realized the same advice applied to me.

388,Advice needed -- Afab nb dating cis man,"Hi !!! 

I'm 23, afab and have recently come out (to a few close friends) as nb. Something inside me clicked a couple months ago, it was such a relief to finally have the words to express why I've never been comfortable in my skin as a girl/woman. This is all new to me and it feels so exciting & scary. 

My partner (25m) and I have been together for about 6 months. He is a wonderful person. He continues to express that he supports me, he adores me and wants me to be the truest version of myself. That being said, he has made it clear (before I came out) that he is drawn to femininity. He's made comments about liking traditionally feminine things like skirts, dresses, long hair, etc. and saying I look good in clothes that ""compliment"" my body. 

It's been difficult as I am still exploring this part of my identity; it feels bittersweet for me to move away from femininity and towards a more authentic expression of myself. I almost feel like I'm mourning being an attractive woman (no more hot girl summer!! :( ). 

Every time we talk about it I feel so fragile. I almost wish that he wasn't so drawn to womanhood/girly things, although I realize that's not something I can change. It makes me sad. I don't think he's done anything wrong, but it's hard to shake the social conditioning of appearing feminine to appeal to my partner. That being said, I know he loves me, this feels like the safest and healthiest relationship I've ever been in, and I want us to grow together.  

Idk what i'm looking for on Reddit. Validation? Advice? Regardless, writing this has been cathartic and I hope someone can relate to my experience.",wji6d8,61,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/wji6d8/advice_needed_afab_nb_dating_cis_man/,"['> he adores me and wants me to be the truest version of myself. That being said, he has made it clear (before I came out) that he is drawn to femininity. \n\nHas he made these comments after you came out as well, or only before?', ""I don't mean to come off as dismissive here, but you've only been dating 6 months. I promise, this doesn't have to be the only good relationship you'll have. At 6 months, you barely know each other and are still in the honeymoon phase. It is the hard times that will really test you. You may be better breaking it off now so that you feel comfortable and free to explore your gender, who you are, and who you want to be. Plenty of people will love you for you and not just for how you present. <3"", ""Just because he is drawn to feminine aspects does not mean that he will necessarily not be drawn to you with less (or no) femininity. I, like many people, am physically attracted to persons who fit several entirely different archetypes, some of which are mutually exclusive and could not realistically exist on the same person's body. A couple of my 'types' are hyper feminine, I also am very into several forms of presentation that are androgynous or blend the feminine with the masculine. It is entirely possible for him to be drawn to you while presenting as feminine, and be drawn to different aspects of you when you are not.  Also, you are at the beginning of this journey into exploring being non-bianary. As you explore what being nb is to you, the primary ways you end up presenting may still have some aspects of femininity, and those could happen to line up with how he finds you attractive.\n\nIn an entirely different direction though, supporting a partner through changes, and finding all of those things attractive are not the same thing. My nesting partner has short, fine, facial hair. I am not attracted to facial hair. I supprt her choosing to keep it. Do I find that detail attractive? No. Do I still find her very attractive? Definitely. There are many types of outfits that I would enjoy seeing her wear, and am not excited visually by some of her outfits she chooses to wear. She wears what she is comfortable in, and what she feels confident in. Quite often what she feels comfortable in is rather androgynous or masculine, rarely is it feminine. The point of her clothing is not to keep me constantly titillated. It is her comfort and self expression. Sometimes she, or I, wear outfits that are not our favorite but we know the other likes; this would not ever extend to either of us wearing something we feel truly uncomfortable or dysphoric about.\nAlmost no couple finds everything about one another attractive. This is not an exclusively LGBTQ+ issue. It is assumed by pop culture that cis-hereronormitive couples will almost all have some aspect of one another that they find repulsive.\n\nHowever, in a slightly different direction, supporting a partner through significant changes sometimes means accepting that them becoming their ideal self can mean supporting them becoming someone who they are incompatible with. Gender and sexuality are important aspects of self. You being able to be true to the reality of you being non-bianary is important. However, if his sexual orientation is that he is only attracted to women, that means that he may eventually have to choose between continuing too see you as the woman he was attracted to (by viewing your identification as nb as not being 'real') or respecting who you are, who is not compatible with his sexual orientation.\n\nOnce again, being drawn to the feminine does not mean he can't be drawn to the masculine, androgynous, non-bianary, or xenogendered. Pansexuality, bisexuality, and polysexuality are real. Personally, cis-male is the only gender I have never noticed myself being attracted to at least once. Also, finding some aspect of one's romantic partners less than perfectly attractive is normal, and does not mean that they do not find their partner attractive overall.\n\nI hope some of this helps."", 'Maybe I‚Äôm going too far into my personal experience with this, but you should probably ask yourself some questions:\n\n-Why do you feel fragile when talking to him about it? Do you feel guilty, perhaps as if you‚Äôre betraying him? Has he expressed his preferences as ‚Äúsomething he can‚Äôt help‚Äù? Does he express his preferences while ‚Äúbeing supportive‚Äù?\n\n-Does he support your gender expression without conditions? Is he building you up *when you are in your preferred clothing* or just nodding his head?\n\n-Have you cut your hair? How did he react? How would he react? Does he think he has a say/right to a negative opinion toward a more masculine haircut?\n\n-Do you actually feel safe and happy? Or just moreso than other relationships?\n\n-How does he react if you present the idea that this relationship isn‚Äôt exactly straight? When you consider this for yourself, how much is he involved in your reservations about that statement?\n\nYou‚Äôre right in that social conditioning is a bitch. I didn‚Äôt realize how stifled I was by my cishet male ex until he broke up with me citing that I ‚Äúmade my gender too confusing‚Äù (almost 3 years of dating and plans for marriage). I spent the last year of the relationship being patient while he promised he was still learning and growing, and making little sacrifices and compromises so he didn‚Äôt feel too ‚Äúanxious‚Äù about my sudden changes, or putting on skirts for date nights so he didn‚Äôt feel too awkward (he just ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù). I thought it was my problem. He was actually just an asshole. \n\nIf he‚Äôs doing things to reinforce that conditioning through compliments or statements about your gender expression, whether or not he claims to disagree with it, you‚Äôre better off on your own. I don‚Äôt know your situation, but six months is usually the end of a honeymoon period. If he‚Äôs giving you lip service about being supportive or an ally or whatever but making his preference for *things that make you dysphoric* evident, that‚Äôs a red flag, and that could very well get worse as the relationship progresses. A good partner would wholeheartedly support you in your element. A good person who realizes this gender shift is not compatible would break up with you. If he is actively resisting things that bring you joy, even if it‚Äôs merely by withholding and giving praise, it doesn‚Äôt matter what his excuse is. That should be met with suspicion. And at the end of the day, it‚Äôs your body, your happiness, your gender, and that‚Äôs more important than appeasing a romantic partner. \n\nGL', 'As a recently discovered demigirl married to a Cis man, maybe I can help?\n\nI disagree with most of the comments so far, honestly. I don\'t think it\'s a ""red flag"" in the traditional sense (ie. A sign to run) that he likes dresses etc. I know my husband thinks I\'m gorgeous in dresses!

I wish I didin't have neither but I don't think I'd replace it with anything.
But over all I don't really mind being a girl, I think if I'd be in a boys body I wouldn't mind it either, if it would look like both or neither then same thing.
I'm thinking of buying a chest binder and tonight I had a dream about having a male chest and was in some boxers and it didin't feel bad but over all I dream like I'm different people, like I was put into a perspective of a widowed 40+year old man once so there's not much of a surprise here.

when it comes to what I prefer people to refer to me with- for now I use They/she, I don't mind if someone calls me a he though. Sometimes I don't like being called a girl, other times I think it's who I am. Sometimes I'm very feminine with dresses and make up, other times not with baggy clothes. I also hate that people immidietaly think I'm a girl whenever they hear my voice.

I never felt like a boy deep down inside though, don't feel a strong connection to nonbinary either, I just feel like me and I don't know what gender that is.
over all I'm a girl who sometimes wants to look like an edgy cute boy or just nothing at all but it's too rare to call it genderfluid I think.
couse I think I'm just a confused cis that's looking for a little term that would still say I'm mostly a girl but sometimes I feel less. Demigirl also isin't really cutting it although I do like it but for me it lacks the he part. Maybe genderqueer would be good to use but I'd also want to feel like I'm not making this all up and someone else feels like I do.

I feel like even if I figure out my gender nothing's gonna stop people from looking at me like a girly girl with my super feminine voice and face (my mom once told me that even if I'd go bald I'd still look like a girl, thought it was a compliment).

398,Yesterday was the anniversary of me realizing I'm most likely not cis,"As the title says, I just realized that yesterday marked one year of me acknowledging that I might not be cis. Or at least to vocalize it to someone and online. It feels very weird. 

In this year, I sadly haven't made as much progress as I would have wanted, not gotten into therapy (but hopefully this month) not really explored my relationship with things that might really be dysphoria or found ways of testing out more fem things. 

But at the same time I've noticed so many things and started really addressing the doubts that started to sprout way back in my last relationship about 4 years ago (god covid really twisted my perception of time). I have found so much freedom in just doing things I want and not care about the preconceived notion they might have: wearing nail polish in any context outside of work, chunky boots with heels (still haven't found standard heels that would fit my big and ugly feet), letting my hair grow, trying to learn makeup, a month ago I pierced my ears and I love it... And most importantly I finally accepted how jealous I can be of women, which feels weird given how hard I'm trying to deconstruct the damage heteronormativity did on me. 

I'm not quite sure why I'm writing this tbh, maybe I'm looking for some pointers as to how advance in this path, but it kinda feels like some kind of important anniversary in the grand scheme of things, and maybe my experience in questioning my gender can help out others.

I've always been a bit boyish. If I could have chose my gender before I was born I would absolutely without a doubt be born male. I.. like my female body..

I am in a relationship with a man and I love him more than I've ever loved anyone before- and of course we are close physically quite often. I noticed myself envying his body. His bone structure is so much more dense than mine. He is so tall and strong. I want to be like that. I wish I was born like that.. 

I was messing around with an app called ""faceapp"" that allows you to manipulate your selfies and pictures in multiple ways. I used the ""male"" filter on a selfie.. and wow.. I was a bit surprised, and heartbroken I wasn't the person in the filter. Another time I was walking out of the theater and my mom happened to be there at the same time as me. I called out to her and she just started for a second then said ""Oh! It's you! I didn't recognize you, I thought you were a boy."" And secretly inside, I loved that. Seeing myself and being perceived so masculine feels good! I've always enjoyed dressing masculine, but my mom is very homophobic and is always bullying me and asking me ""ARE YOU GAY!?""because of how I present myself sometimes. I have never showed interest in women and have only ever dated men. Once I bought boy's shoes because they didn't have my size in women and my mom started crying.. 

I'm kind of rambling I feel but I need an outlet to vent. I do not want to go through hormones therapy or anything like that since I do very much enjoy my breasts and being able to be a stereotypical girl some days, but I would like to dress masculine presenting more often. I just feel.. guilty and weird about it. I am sad that (I live in the south..) society will most likely judge me. I fear that women and men will bully me, and that my family will.. dislike and bully me.

405,Anyone else feel like their gender shifts with where they live?,"For context, I'm AFAB and grew up in suburban New England as an incurable ""tomboy"". Didn't really think I was trans, but I did start binding (terribly!) regularly to school as a teenager. Then I moved to Montreal for college, where I really flourished as a person and first embraced my queer identity. Ironically, though, I actually moved more to a feminine side of presentation and explored dresses and skirts and had a blast with it. I think I felt pretty cis back then.

Then I moved back to New England and started feeling uncomfortable with being feminine again. After five years in New England, I'd adopted the term genderqueer, started dressing more ""tomboy"" again, started using they/them pronouns alongside she/her. 

*Then* I moved south again, all the way to the Bible Belt (whoops). And here I feel even *less* connected to anything woman or female or feminine. Now I use only they/them pronouns at work, bind daily again (better now), and my dresses and skirts haven't been touched in ages. Yet when I went back to Montreal for a visit last month, I immediately gravitated toward some dresses in the thrift stores -- but didn't buy any because I knew I'd feel wrong in them again back home.

I feel like, to an extent, my comfort with a feminine identity is dependent on how femininity is understood where I'm living. An average Montrealer's idea of femininity is *very* different from the average Southerner's, and while ""woman"" doesn't feel like me no matter where I go, Montreal femininity feels far more like me than Southern femininity. I don't know how much is just my expression changing, rather than my identity itself, but I do feel like it's a little bit of both.

407,"I'm genderqueer AMAB, want to start dressing more androginously in public","Hi everyone!

As the title says I'm genderqueer AMAB, I'm in my late 20s and, long story short, I have wanted for a while to mix a bit my wardrobe up with more female-looking clothes to have more androgynous looks -- i own a few already. I'm tall-ish and skinny, 5'9 by 135lbs roughly, so my body is not too masculine per se even  though I have broad shoulders.

As far as women clothes are concerned, my style entails wearing stuff like blouses (not tight-fitting ones, more flowy or oversized  types) as for the top, high-waisted wide-leg pants as bottoms, possibly  throwing in some scarves as accessories. So, nothing too far from men clothing, however i also like to wear something more colorful (like pink, gold, flowers) than what I usually buy as male clothes, which is usually very plain, never patterned. I also like wearing different fabrics, that look softer and more feminine, such as silk, satin, viscose etc. and that drift a bit from the plain cotton clothes that are basically the only choice as guys.

These are examples of my kind of clothes, just to give an idea of what I'd like to style:- blouse: [https://www.amazon.com/LilySilk-Blouse-Women-Sleeves-Smooth/dp/B07NKYR7VY](https://www.amazon.com/LilySilk-Blouse-Women-Sleeves-Smooth/dp/B07NKYR7VY)

All  this premise to say that I'd like to ask about your advice about a couple of thing, since - as you maybe can imagine - as an AMAB doing this feels a bit scary. I know that silky and shiny fabrics as I like to wear are basically never worn by guys: is it really weird, in the sense of eye-catching, to see a male in these clothes? Is it safe to wear them in public in your experience, especially while still passing as male since I wouldn't fully dress, wear makeup, use a wig etc?

We don‚Äôt decide to get gender euphoria, it just happens.

I like being masculine right now, it feels so right and I feel so at home, so I will continue doing this.

But through talking to a lot of cis people, I've realised my experience is very different. Like, my discomfort and confusion with gender as a concept is so visceral in a way a cis person could never understand. It has been immensely frustrating my entire life, at every turn, to be forced into this category and all the expectations that come with it within a system I could never relate to or begin to comprehend. However, I never felt too much discomfort presenting as a masculine woman, even sometimes wanting to present in a feminine manner, so WAS I just a tomboy or was it something else?\n\nThus, I have found solace with the term genderqueer! The concluison I came to is that I just can't relate to the concept of gender at all, and yet am happy to be reffered to as a woman most of the time because that is how I present, albeit usually masculinely, and I am fine with how I present and I just don't care about or relate to the concept of gender enough to feel the need to be reffered to differently, this shit's all fluid anyway and I don't feel the need to put myself in a box (and to be clear I am not saying the binary is invalid for those who align within it, it is just not for me).\n\nI am still figuring this all out, and I hope that you do too!

415,"Uncertainty about ""demiboy"" and ""demiman""?","Hi, all. First time making a post like this, so apologies if I do any of it wrong. 

So, I am looking for the term for what I'm feeling. I'm in my 30s and having some possible words for it would really help. 

I am AMAB. I present as male, and I like feeling masculine or male. I have never felt especially feminine. I'm gay. 

However, I have come to realize there are days (or hours or minutes) where I find myself feeling without gender. I just feel like me.

The more I have thought about it, the more I find I am comfortable having words like male, masculine, bro, and so on applied to me. But ""man"" is always a little uncomfortable. Even when I feel most masculine, I don't feel like a ""man."" 

What people assume to be my natural state of maleness based on appearance, behavior, voice, and so on is more like a comfortable jacket I like to wear than something innate.

I'm glad terms like demiboy exist, and I embrace anyone who feels it's right for them. But ""boy"" doesn't feel right to me at 34. The term as a whole isn't something I can say to coworkers easily without extended explanation, and people I know seem to assume that even ""demiman"" or ""demimasculine"" implies that I feel closer to something feminine than I would if I just identified as male. As I try to think through the conversations I might have with my boyfriend or my parents, I'm not sure the demi-family of identities click for me. 

I am hoping there's another words that might feel like it better fits. Feeling male and agender isn't uncomfortable, but not having the words to talk about it is.

416,questioning my gender identity,"I've never been a girl-ish girl (I'm afab). I really hated dresses, skirts, make-up, styling my hair in a feminine way, wearing nail polish etc anything typical feminine. Not that appearance equals gender but I just couldn't look at myself in mirror when wearing these things, I remember me literally crying when I my hair were braided and when I had to wear a dress for my uncles wedding.

Entering puberty, I started to develop well, my chest. I consider myself to be quite lucky, as my chest isn't too big When I wear baggy clothes, you barley see it, so I don't have alot of dysphoria. However, when I have to shower, I just feel uncomfortable looking at it, it just doesn't feel like it's mine if you know what I mean, but I have no problem with my genitials. I do remember, when my chest started to grow, that my mom told me I was becoming ""a real woman"", it felt so weird and uncomfortable. I even try to bind my chest a bit, especially in thight t-shirt and stuff, I really don't want to see my chest in the reflections of the windows I walk by. 

Honestly, I don't really *get* gender. I understand gender roles, and I thought, that's what makes people feel like they fit that role and gender or not. But after I've done research, I came to the conclusion it's more of a ""feeling"" rather than wanting to fit in gender roles or not. At some point I asked myself ""what makes me a girl? I don't *feel* like one, it's just that everyone assumes I'm a girl because I'm born with the body of one"".
When ppl see me irl, it's quite easy to see I'm afab, so ppl just assume im a girl, which is okay-ish, but I don't like to be referred as one. So compliments like ""you are such a pretty girl"" ""this girl...-"" ""You're becoming a real lady"" etc makes me feel suffocated. The most uncomfortable part is when ppl ask me my gender online; ""female or male"". I don't *feel* like a girl, and if I had the choice, I wouldn't want ppl to see me like that, but I'm not a guy either I think. So I just always said ""I prefer not to share"". Calling myself and introducing myself as a girl feels so super weird. When I look at myself in the mirror and call myself a girl, I have this voice in my head who just says ""no..."" 

When I have the choice online, especially around lgbtia folks, I prefer to come across as more masculine/neutral, or well, just anything but feminine. When they ask the same ""female or male"" question, I just say male. I don't feel like a guy, but absolutely not like a girl either. Well, I do prefer masculine/neutral terms over feminine ones (bro, dude, buddy, sir, person, sib, partner etc) I know that pronouns don't equal gender tho. I also know appearance doesn't equal gender but if I had the choice, I'd love to present neutral and/or masculine

Recently there was this kid who asked me ""wait, are you a boy?"". I was honestly so happy he said that. Not that he thought I was a boy, just because he didn't saw me as a girl. Apparently, I was all smiling and stuff so a friend of mine was so confused why I was smiling. My friend wanted the kid to apologize aha.. but I couldn't help but feel happy. Love that kid X)

I tend to feel some sort of ""I wish that was me/I wish I looked like that"" feeling, especially when I see men with long hair or any other androgyne character 

Gender is all about the internal feeling though. Again, idk what gender really means, I don't *feel* like a certain gender, rather just an alignment, I guess masculine/neutral alignment because I'd like to be called masc/neutral terms but idk. Irl, I'm okay-ish when ppl assume im a girl, just the comments of them refering to me as a girl make me uncomfortable, but she/her pronouns are acceptable. But online, when I have the choice in the way how ppl see me, I'd rather present as someone masculine/neutral. It just makes me feel happy and more like myself. 
Idk if my alignments change tho, I can't tell if I feel feminine or *want* to be feminine because for the sake of not wanting to make things difficult for other ppl. Also because I'm raised as a girl, so if I would leave my femininity behind I feel like I'd leave myself behind. But when I have this idealised version of myself in my head, I don't present feminine at all. 

So, what do you guys think? Could you perhaps help me find a label, or give me some sort of directions on where to look at? Help will be really appreciated:)",wdmlpt,7,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/wdmlpt/questioning_my_gender_identity/,"['Maybe you are agender or nonbinary?

You'll get there in the end! Also, if you go with a label then a few months later decide it's not right for you you can always change it. No-one's policing this, and for some their gender changes over time anyway. Best of luck with your journey!"", 'I can give you a label that may work... I use it myself ""Human"".

In my mind I can\'t see why people can\'t see that race and gender just boils down to ""Paint Jobs and Plumbing""...\n\nSo keep trying things until you can live without having to worry about how the rest of the world sees you.

418,Stranger at the gym telling it like it is...,"I identify as GQ/NB and am on hormones. I'm still trying to figure out what's comfortable for me as there are parts of hormones that I like and others that I don't. That said, I still prefer a more masculine presentation in public, albeit more androgynous. My facial hair is almost totally gone and I've lost about 30 pounds in the last year.

I work out almost every day because it helps keep me sane and on a schedule. I will typically go in the sauna afterwards to relax and unwind, usually keeping my shirt on. 

Last night, this guy that I've seen a whole bunch of times before started talking to me in the sauna. Never talked to him in my life. He said ""I've seen you coming here for a long time. Your body is really changing."" I assumed he meant my weight loss. 

Nope.

He was like ""you have women's breasts now. I can see it."" I was like ""ummmm....thanks?""

I'm of two minds on that reaction. We had a long conversation about gender and he has trans people in his family. He's very accepting.

I think i have an identity crisis when it comes to gender

Hi!I am an 19 years old girl and i feel rlly discontent with how i am perceived and how i look.Whenever i see a dude on the street i find good looking i kinda feel rage towards him bc i don't look like him.Honestly it never came up to me that i may be trans till i sent some pictures of my diary to a friend and She saw i used masculine everything when i wrote about me and She said to me that this is not normal.I rlly can t say why i did that.I ve never showed any signs of disphoria as a kid excepting that i would make my Voice sound deeper bc i just liked it that way more.I was quite girly,like dresses and barbies and pink and had long hair and all that.I don't know what happened to me,I just cant feel comfortable in my skin.I avoid going outside bc i hate social interactions,I hate how my Voice becomes high pitched when i am nervous,hate how dudes look at me,hate how i don't look like i want to.I don't hate the thought of being a Parent,I specifically hate the thought of being a mother.The thought of becoming pregnant makes me puke and it gives me major disconfort.I cant have romantic relationships bc i hate my face(i just hate my features,for a while i thought that bc i am an ugly girl,that makes me feel frustrated and i mix it up with dysphoria ) and  body.The thought of having sex with a dude in this body like being penetrated and shit disgusts me.I dont like being sexualised the way girls are being sexualised.Whenever someone said i have a masculine Voice or body or gestures I felt extremely happy and i didn't thought much about that at that moment but now i just thing it was kinda weird.I have to mention that i used to suffer from an eating disorder and i had a rough childhood and i thought maybe that feeds into my insecurities and those insecurities and lack of acceptance of myself could ve made me think i am someone i am not.Also there are Times when i don't mind my female body but my ""social dysphoria""sucks at any time.The social dysphoria part i think it became worse and worse bc i didn't have a problem with that neither before.I was quite a shy kid that always felt uncomortable in it's own skin but that never linked with wanting to be a boy at that moment at all.
I used to pretend to be a dude on the internet bc people talking to me like i am one made me feel pure fucking joy but i don't do that anymore.Sorry If my english is bad and I didn't express clearly what problem i have.I was fat,skinny,fit,had all sorts of haircuts and styles of hair,experimented with feminine clothing,masculine clothing,make-up.I felt like shit in all of the stages.Insatisfaction,this is the word.Nothing makes me feel satisfied.I also have to say that If i have to wear a dress or heals i don't find it that bad,I do wear them even though i don't feel excelent in them.I cant conform easily to society expectations of what a woman should be but that doesn't feel like me at all.Its like some kind of cosplay more.Do You thing i have a gender problem or I am just insecure about my feminity bc I am quite unattractive and didn't have much masculine validation and now I think i want to be a dude more like a counterattack?bc thats what i tell myself everytime bc it doesn't feel as bad as a person with actual dysphoria would but it still affects my life a lot and I cant find solutions no matter how hard i try",w9rz6y,7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/w9rz6y/questioning_my_identity/,"[""sounds like classic gender dysphoria\n\n[This article](https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85) describes everything you described.

433,"No physical dysphoria (?), but very trans behaviour. Considering transitioning - advice? (19/ftm?) PLEASE READ FIRST"," Where do I start. I'm 19 and considering transitioning to male. This isn't a decision I'm taking lightly, and I'm trying to examine and consider all of my feelings and life experiences to decide if this is the correct decision for me:

My parents were always very relaxed and progressive, and raised me as a girl, but in a very gender neutral way - I played with girl and boy toys, and never dressed especially masculine or feminine. Unrelated to gender identity, I've always been quite a neutral person in terms of hobbies and such. 
I never felt dysphoria as a kid, but ever since I was on the playground I'd always want to roleplay as a male character (around age 5 or so). This continued until I was a tween, where I still continually identified with male characters rather than female ones. Every Halloween I wanted to be something genderless or something male. Etc. Around age 12 I began crossdressing in secret, although all my attempts were pretty poor. I also recently found a video of me attempting to do voice masculinisation exercises from when I was 12, that clearly comes from a FTM source. 
A few years later when I was about 15 or so I had my first big 'trans' phase - I never socially transitioned or anything, but for a few months I was absolutely fixated on getting a haircut (which I never did for a couple of external reasons), watching FTM top surgery videos and FTM media content in general. I made up a new hypothetical name for myself and a ""trans wishlist"" on my notesapp and crossdressed A LOT. But ultimately nothing came of it. I thought something along the lines of ""why bother"" because living as a girl was tolerable. I never felt dysphoria about my body, my breasts/genitals etc never caused me any bother. So I didn't see the point of going through so much distress and effort to transition.
After this, mostly due to social pressures at school I went through a hyperfeminine phase (still a lot less feminine than the average girl) but I wore eyeliner every day and had long hair and occasionally wore skirts, etc. I was about 17 at this point. But after school ended I immediately stopped it all. No more makeup or feminine clothes or anything. I didn't feel the need to perform femininity anymore because my social environment had changed, so I stopped. I would still crossdress from time to time, even more so after school ended. I would tuck my hair into a hat and put on a big coat and take long walks outside and deep down hope I'd be clocked as male. 
When I started university, the need to perform hyperfeminity flared up again and I'd occasionally wear eyeliner and present femme again, but I kept getting more and more ""non binary urges"" as I jokingly called it at the time. I was feeling more and more urge to cut my hair and change my presentation, and this time after months of consideration I finally did. I started off considering myself an NB woman, then just NB after my haircut. I started to renew my wardrobe with much more masculine clothes to the point where they're the only clothes I wear now. I even bind occasionally, but more to increase my chance of being clocked as male, not because my breasts make me dysphoric. I got my close friends to start referring to me with they/them pronouns, and so far everything feels much better. I'm always taking pictures in the mirror, admiring myself and feeling confident and happy even though I know I'm much less conventionally attractive than I was before. 
ID-ing as NB is much nicer, but I think deep down I've always considered it a stepping stone for a full binary FTM transition. I don't want surgery, but everything HRT changes is appealing to me. I've been blessed with hairy generics pre-t and love having body hair. I workout at the gym, I love presenting masc, and taking T and living fully as a male sounds so appealing to me. Not just exciting, but ...fulfilling? But I still don't experience physical dysphoria, so I don't understand these feelings.
I've heard stories of trans guys sleeping in binders, showering with the lights off, self harming, all kinds of mental anguish from their dysphoria and yet I've never felt that. If someone told me I absolutely had to live as a woman forever I'd be bummed out but I could cope with it fine. I've been out as NB for about 6 months now and never felt better. I want to take things slowly and thoughtfully, so I'm giving it a full year before I see what steps to take next - although I am considering asking my close friends to try out he/him pronouns for me in a few months time. Transition isn't something I'm taking lightly, even if it is a very exciting prospect to me.

Male-ness has always had some bizzare intrinsic appeal to me. I've always been obsessed with male characters to the point of disinterest in female ones (especially in my early teenage years). But this isn't me trying to emulate something I'm attracted to because sexually and romantically I'm much more into women. I have no trauma regarding girlhood and no internalised misogyny whatsoever. I'm not trying to run or escape from anything. I don't have depression or anxiety. I have no idea what could be causing me these feelings because I really don't experience physical dysphoria at all. Was I just progressively socialised enough to view men having afab bodies as normal? Am I just hardwired to not care? The last six months has been great, but I do feel incredibly embarrassed talking to anyone IRL about my gender feelings. But I think that's just the kind of person I am - I was very shy and nervous to tell my extremely accepting and loving parents that I was bi, and equally nervous to tell my loving and accepting friends that I was NB.

So yeah. Any advice on other things I should consider or look into?

Something I like to keep in mind is that gender euphoria is a sign just the same as gender dysphoria. If masculinity feels more comfortable, then boom, there's your answer.

How that's achieved ultimately doesn't matter. You don't need surgery if you don't want it. And if hormones cover the desired change, awesome! No trans person is any one thing.

They are all just people. I don‚Äôt assume things of other people‚Äôs personality based off of their appearance or what my head would assume their biological sex characteristics to be most like.

I don't like it when I'm wearing girly clothing and I'm adressed as a boy by strangers.

I strive to attain a body that is androgynous. Meaning that, I want to seem as gender neutral as possible (as a male I try to maintain my body hair and my body fat).

When I use feminine clothing, I do not struggle with dysphoria due to my genitals. On the contrary, I feel excited by using this clothing and seeying that I look good on it.

I'm not sure about my sex id. I always presented myself as a male cisgender person. However, I feel that's not accurate anymore.

I never really cared about being male or non binary or anything really, as it doesn't define who I am but I feel I need this in order to understand myself better.

And with so much identifies in the noo-binary spectrum, I can't seem to find something that suits me well enough.

Let me tell you a story.\n\nWhen I was around 21/22, I escaped an abusive relationship and entered into a long period of confusion and unsurity in my life. I dissociated for about four months straight after escaping this relationship. But not only had I escaped this relationship, for the first time in my adult life, I was free to think about myself again, and I also immediately entered into a gender crisis. I was reading more and more about being nonbinary. I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. I also couldn\'t stop gaslighting myself about it.\n\nFor months and months and months, I tortured myself. I spent hours pouring over gender lists and gender blogs dedicated to archiving all the new terms people were creating. I *wanted* to be nonbinary, but I didn\'t feel like I was enough. I didn\'t feel valid. I didn\'t fit the popular narrative of knowing since I was 4 years old and being sure and hating every aspect of my body. Surely, I was just faking it.\n\nSo I spent all my free time digging deep through gender dictionaries, trying to find something that *sparked*. Something that would prove I just fit. If only I could pinpoint exactly how I felt have that moment of ""click!"" eureka, then that would somehow prove and validate my feelings.\n\nUntil one day I\'d gotten no where, and I was fucking tired of hating and punishing myself. Not wanting to feel this way anymore was why I\'d escaped my relationship in the first place, yet here I was, putting myself through the same damn thing.\n\nI vowed then to stop beating myself up and gaslighting myself and instead just let me feel my feelings. Even though I felt wrong and like a faker, I decided to just let myself privately identify as nonbinary. I would stop obsessing over a microlabel. I would stop invalidating myself. I would stop acting like I had to have that One Perfect Label to be valid and worthy. I would just let myself *experience*. And I did. I stopped fighting myself, and I just let myself get used to my feelings.\n\nThen, one day, a couple years later, I was standing outside the gym with a gym buddy, and he mentioned something about how he was really more agender than anything else, and I was excitedly telling him about how I was nonbinary as well. We chatted for a couple more moments, then parted ways. \n\nAnd walking away, I was just so struck by how lighthearted and happy I felt. I hadn\'t forced myself to deny myself or forced myself to be something I wasn\'t. I had become a safe space for myself. Then, when another person granted me safe space, I was sharing that authenticity with them. I *was* nonbinary. The only thing that had truly changed from this moment to when I first started questioning is that I *let* myself have that authenticity. I didn\'t deny it or invalidate it or fight against myself.\n\nPoint being: there\'s not always that one, specific, right term, and coming to grips with yourself doesn\'t always look one way. So many people don\'t have that magical moment of sudden understanding that cis people want us to have to be valid. For many of us, it\'s a slower, more gradual, more difficult process. And sometimes, you have to be the one that stops standing in your way.\n\nLabels *can* help us put name to our feelings. But there\'s not always a perfect label that specifically details our feelings, and coming to terms with ourselves is more about getting in touch with our feelings than it is boiling down complex human emotions to one, simple word.']"

440,am i non binary or does gender simply not exist?,"okay, i‚Äôm gonna get straight to the point. biologically, i‚Äôm female but i‚Äôve always hated the concept of gender, even before i knew that you could be something like ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù.
i‚Äôve always hated being referred to as a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù or ‚Äúwoman‚Äù and i wouldn‚Äôt wanna be referred to as a ‚Äúboy‚Äù or ‚Äúman‚Äù either. i just feel kinda uncomfortable when someone uses those terms to describe me. like, i mean, it doesn‚Äôt make me cry but it makes me cringe. 
i just wanna be human. nothing else. i don‚Äôt fucking care. i just wanna live. i like baggy clothes, i like skirts, i like dresses, i like wearing make up and i like not wearing make up. but like: all that doesn‚Äôt matter? because i am just human and i am in this body and like i am okay with this body and i am okay with having a vagina but i guess i‚Äôd also be okay with having a dick? 

and i wanna know: do people actually feel female or male? i don‚Äôt wanna invalidate the trans community (or cis people) but i don‚Äôt really get the concept of feeling like a gender? like how does that feel? 
is the fact that i don‚Äôt know how it feels proof that i am non-binary or is it just proof that idgaf about gender roles? i really don‚Äôt know. does gender exist? if so, im probably non-binary but if not, how does everyone seem to feel ‚Äúmale‚Äù, female‚Äù or whatever?

I'm 33, and I have a very feminine looking body. I'm curvy, have long hair and I am AFAB female. Since I was a child, I was always fascinated by androgynous people and by women able to pass as men (Mulan, Anne Bonny etc). Something has always been bugging me for years but I tried to bury it. I've always hated my body but I thought it was something everybody experienced. Lately, it's been more and more difficult to pretend that everything is normal. It's summer and every day when it's time for me to dress, I stare at my closet and I cry. None of my clothes feel right. I always wore very feminine clothes and now the only dresses I'm able to wear are those which completely cover my legs and my hips. Every time I think of myself as cisgender, I also want to cry. I wondered if I felt like I was a man trapped in a woman's body but that's not it either. I don't feel like a man, but I don't feel like a woman either. Sometimes I still like to wear dresses and low-cut shirts but it's just sometimes. Most of the time, I want to cover my body and pretend like it does not exist. Since I'm very curvy by nature, I know that I cannot pass as androgynous and it saddens me more than I could express. It's been brewing for years but now, I don't know who I am anymore. I wish I could have a smooth body, with no identifying features whatsoever, but sometimes, I still like to wear feminine clothes (provided it covers most of my body). I'm not even able to look at myself in a mirror anymore. Some of my friends know about it but they don't know how to help me. They suggested that I change the way I dress and I think that could be a start but that's not enough. I feel like I really need to understand who I am and I really don't know. Am I genderfluid? Am I non binary? Am I someone else entirely? Frankly I coudn't say and that's what I'm here writing this.

I ended up not getting approved by insurance, even after an appeal, because I‚Äôm overweight and they didn‚Äôt think it would make a significant difference in my health, so I ended up having to pay out of pocket (it did make a difference, both mentally and physically!) If you can argue medical/physical need (migraines, back/neck pain from too much weight, etc) and get it validated in a letter by a doctor that helps. However, my surgeon thought I was likely to get approved with the combo of neck pain, overall size, and yeast infections underneath, but it still fell through, so it depends on your insurance. Overall timeline-wise, it took a couple months to get a consultation after calling, then a couple months fighting with insurance, then scheduled surgery for approx. 4 months after insurance rejection. \n\n‚Äî The surgery itself was about 4 hours I think, and was outpatient, so I left about 1-2 hours after waking up. The drive home was uncomfortable, but not unbearable. The pain was mostly burning, and not overwhelming, just uncomfortable. It took about 1-2 weeks to be comfortable going back to my office-type job, but I couldn‚Äôt lift anything significant or raise my arms very high for several more weeks. I slept in an armchair for about a week, then used a wedge pillow + body pillow combo for another couple weeks to sleep semi upright. \n\n‚Äî I ended up scarring exceptionally badly, despite healing quickly, so I had a revision surgery about a year later, with general anesthesia, then steroid injections (which were painful, but are helping!) \n\n‚Äî I insisted to the surgeon, very firmly, that I wanted him to remove *as much as possible.* he ended up removing about 4lbs total, I went from a 40H to about a B, but the shape is relatively androgynous because it‚Äôs far flatter/wider than a standard ‚Äúfemale‚Äù chest. I‚Äôm pretty happy with my results, even with the scarring! I do lean masc in presentation, but with how large-bodied I am I think a little extra fat in the chest looks more natural than fully flat would. The only downside is I wish I could be shirtless in public.', 'I got top surgery about a month ago for gender affirmation. \n\nThe approval process was long but not difficult, though I live in a liberal area and had supportive medical professionals. I had to get two letters, one of which my endocrinologist was kind enough to give me so I didn‚Äôt need to see a second gender affirming therapist. The hospital I used also had someone who‚Äôs job was to help fight the insurance company and she was really great so no work on my part.\n\nThe surgery was set four hours but the surgeon did it in less time, they just allot a larger window in case. I had a double incision mastectomy, masculinizing liposuction, nipple grafting/ resizing, and nerve reattachment (which is uncommon). Normally, the surgery is outpatient but my surgeon liked doing an overnight which was honestly the worst part of it all (had to share a room while in pain/ discomfort and did not sleep) but I ended up having some issues with anesthesia so it was for the better.\n\nI‚Äôm only a month into recovery and I‚Äôve felt fine for about two weeks. The first week was rough between pain, bandages, and drains but it was tolerable and worth it. After that, you have to wear a compression vest for 6-8 weeks and two of those weeks you have to change bandages and antibiotics. Once the drains are out, most of the focus is on nipple healing.\n\nI know that I‚Äôm coming from a place of privilege but I think top surgery results are not something to skimp on, especially to avoid follow up surgeries. A lot of people get out if state surgeries for gender affirming care, which sounds harder but may be an option worth exploring if there‚Äôs no place close to you that you like. I think the expense of travel is worth it for safety and better results but I have no idea where trans people who get surgery out of state stay when they recover and that sounds stressful to me. Also recommend looking for surgeons at nearby universities with hospitals, as a lot if colleges are liberal leaning and therefore may have gender affirming care.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, start by looking for a gender affirmation therapist. They can give you one of your letters and can recommend surgeons that past clients may have used.', 'I had a uni friend who got hers done because they were massive, even after surgery they were still bigger than mine.

It doesn't come with any requirements or restrictions on what one's gender changes between, or how often, or under what circumstances. Some genderfluid people may be influenced by the people they're around, and others may not be.\n\nAs for wanting to feel a different way, I think that's a pretty universal human experience. Our experience of gender is what it is, just like sexual orientation. It's not something we choose, but we can have desires that don't match our current experience. And that includes our experience of gender. So, yes."", ""My gender is externally malleable. Being physical with my gf often times makes me feel masc (I'm afab).

There were other times when feeling gender upset me in some way, concretely, feeling manly, but I think it was because of internalized transphobia of sorts.""]"

I was born female and was perceived as so during my upbringing. Often did I mess around with gender rolls and how I expressed that. 

Personally genderqueer to me means I don‚Äôt strongly identify with any gender. I look at my body and am thankful that I have this vessel to procure a life for myself. I feel the way I present has little correlation to how I feel with my gender. I do dress more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù but because I love the clothes not because I feel like a girl. The way I express my gender is mainly through art and I use it as a medium to let my feelings flow free. I do not get that from getting dressed in the morning. I just feel as thought my body is a female body but my mind is more focused on other things. I have contemplated my gender from an early age. Its not an after thought as much as I feel more genderless than anything.

I am a big fan of not using labels as for me I feel as though there can be less room to grow. I also just don‚Äôt feel the need to heavily look into all the terms just to not find something that speaks to me and my personal experience. 

Felt the need to get this out there cause its such a confusing thing and reading peoples feeling on how they feel and present has helped me feel more comfortable.

Just wanna say I definitely understand that my experience is different from others who identify with genderqueer or anything similar to what I am going through.

Now, we do understand those things, and the terms we adopted before then now have ambiguity in them. Does a man who says he's gay mean he's attracted to masc identifying people? Non-fem-identifying? People with penises? Something else? The term has ambiguity; it's his responsibility to clarify exactly what he means by saying he's gay.\n\nNon-binary people are free to use gay, straight, lesbian etc if they feel it will adequately express their general attraction preferences. So can people who are interested in non-binary people. The ambiguity present in those terms makes them inclusive by default. I personally identify as a non-binary lesbian, for example, because I feel that label adequately expresses who I'm interested in.\n\nWe also have other orientation labels that are explicitly non-ambiguously inclusive of non-binary identities. For example, trixic, toric, neptunic, marsic, uranic. Some of these are based on the person identifying being non-binary, some include non-binary in their attraction, some specifically are based only on the attraction without specifying the identifier's gender.  When you think about it, there's really no reason that I have to define my orientation towards others based on who *I* am. I don't have to be non-binary attracted to women, I can be just *attracted to women.* There are hundreds of orientation labels out there to choose from, just like there are hundreds of gender labels to choose from under the non-binary umbrella.\n\nRemember that these terms are also generalities. A man who says he's straight isn't attracted to every single woman on the planet. It's just a general indication of the people he might find attractive. There may be some women he's not attracted to, or some men that he is, but that doesn't negate his identity as a straight man because he's *generally* interested in women. It's not an exhaustive specification. It's also possible to use different words in different contexts. I might use nblw, or lesbian, or trixic or some other label, depending on whom I'm speaking with. By default, if I'm talking to a cis man, I'd probably reach for lesbian since that's something they're likely familiar with. In my non-binary support group, I use trixic, because they understand that term.\n\nBottom line, everyone has a unique experience of attraction, and each individual gets to pick the words they use to try to describe it. There aren't any wrong answers. There are no label police.

Obviously this is tagged NSFW but at least when I'm fantasizing I can have some pretty intense kinks, so be warned.

Somewhat frequently, when I'm having sexual fantasies, I imagine having a vagina for the purposes of, well, getting railed.

It started out as just being a trans dude (in these fantasies) but it graduated to sometimes having gropeable tits and sometimes just straight-up being a woman so that I could get people into bed with me more easily and have an easier time being a slut (although that might just be sour grapes about my masculine ass not getting any.) I also feel like it's easier to imagine people overpowering me and being super rough and violent if I'm a woman in the fantasy. My body type is pretty masculine, I played sports in high school, I have short hair, I'm pretty muscular and hairy, but I feel like my type would more likely be attracted to more of a twink. I really only have these thoughts in a sexual context, though, specifically when I am already horny, fantasizing, and usually jacking off.

edit: last thread https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/vto69z/fundie_parents_found_me_out_and_threw_me_out/ thought i should add it as i have plenty of time right now.

so my parents found out i was staying at my cousins appartment and i only had a 30mintes to get out of there before they got there. im not going back, dad (step-dad, forced to call him dad, clarify) will beat me to a pulp. cousin was very sad and angry, he had told his sister he couldnt come over to her as he had me ""visiting"". he told her to not say anything but she did tell her mom and soon my parents knew. 

edit: i should say things were great at cousins appartment, i was starting to feel a little better, he was very funny and we watched a million movies and ate ice cream. i disnt want to talk about the bad stuff but i should have planned when i had the chance, i knew it coulsnt last forever but i wanted it to.

so i had to get out of there, cousin was in contact with a bunch of groups and agencies but as i was safe they didnt have to come get me basically. im bad with phones so he talked for the most part. 

anyway, i got out, that was several hours ago, very early. im sitting on a bench in a ""park"" with my laptop on my lap. i think ill sit here for a while. im trying to think. im counting leaves on the tree. i dont think im ok but im mostly numb. i dont understand this is my life right now.

im going to call my cousin for those numbers later, i bet my parents are still there interrogating him. i feel bad that he has to deal with that because of me. i feel im a huge burden for everyone. im numb one minute and very sad the next. sorry im doing most of the talking. 

i dont want anyting from any of you other than be accepted i guess.

at least its warm outside.

edit: ive been cutting back on my medication to make them last longer. but ive deffinetly noticed things getting worse because of it

edit 2: i moved and is now sitting under a tree instead, better connection, to wifi, not nature. im getting worried someting have happened to cousin as he should have called long before now, but im afraid if i call him my parents might be there still and see or hear it. 

also sorry for my spelling, my head isnt right.

edit 3: cousin called, parents stayed there for hours waiting ofr me to come back and now he see them sitting in the car outside waiting even though they told him they would be going. So it looks like ill be here a while more. apparently they threatened him with calling the police and say he kidnapped me among other things. i hate that they are this persistent i wish they would just forget about me. 

ill turn off my devices now to save power, ill see if i can find somewhere to charge them but im not good with people or groups of people.

thank you for keeping me company, if i dont check in im probaby just saving power. 

<3

__________________________________________________________

edit: time 0230 am, im going to walk back. been very rough to be out for so long and its kinda scary. i feel like a stray. the lack of medication is defiantly getting to me, i see people in every shadow and the whispers have started again. someone gave the tip of library to change and i did that several hours ago, so very thanks for that.

i dont know if i will stay at cousin or just get some supplies and go somewhere else in the morning. im very numb to all of this right now, i barely cry at all. a few people in the park have been worried for me (probably as I look very young and small), i just say things are ok and move somewhere else in the park or around it. especially a dog walked who saw me like three times was worried and the third time they really stated to ask questions so i left and sat in mcdonald for a bit. havent really eaten much and havent slept at all which isnt helping.

______________________________________________________________

edit its 11am. i was with cousin around 4am i think, i slept there for a little bit and ate some random stuff. i really dont feel safe htere anytmore after parents was there yesterday. i was half panicking walking the last block, seeing their car everywhere. im also jumpy around police which isnt a good  characteristic to have . 

so im walking again ii don t really have a huge plan atm to  be honest, cousin wanted me  to stay for longer as he thought i was incoherent , so that also made me paranoid if he had talked to my parents or somehting , so i left right away at around 9am. im walking again, no real plan right now. ill not go to the same park again incase people reccognize me . e so im down to quarter dose and i think im having withdrawals, i feel very poorly and super jumpy. it will be ok though. im going to rest for a bit at starbucks and maybe even buy somehting if i can. devices are charged and i got cousins powerbank too , . so todays plan is rest and let time pass. feeling so paranoid.

thank you all for being here 

it will be ok when its ok

Hostile behavior will be met with permanent bans. No appeals, no questions asked.', ""In most jurisdictions, kicking an under-18 child out of the house is a crime, excepting the situation where the child is legally emancipated, which I assume doesn't apply to you. Also I saw from your original post that your dad had beaten you, that is very obviously a crime and is grounds for immediately removing you from that home environment and getting you into a different environment. Usually, authorities will try to place you with a member of extended family over a generic foster family, so there is a distinct likelihood that they would let you live with your cousin or perhaps with another nearby family member.\n\nKeep in mind, when you talk to authorities (or anyone) you can choose exactly how much to tell them. You don't need to tell them anything about your LGBTQ status, if you think you would be safer not sharing that, then don't share that, just say what your parents did to you.\n\nI don't know much about the legal situation you are in, or what the local police force is like, but if you are worried about your parents lying to police, it might help to contact the police first and give them your story about what is going on. If there is evidence that you were beaten this will strengthen your case.\n\nJust sitting and being silent could allow them to make a false report to police that goes unchallenged and that could complicate efforts to get you out of the situation.\n\nAlso keep in mind that if you do not act now, you might have limited legal options. People under 18 have a lot more legal protection than people over 18. I.e. kicking someone over 18 out is not generally a crime, but under 18 it is. Beating someone always is, but there are additional consequences and forms of intervention that happen when the person is under 18, so consider that. Hopefully, if you talk to the right person you could get more thorough advice from someone who knows more.\n\nThe most important thing for you to do is to stay safe. I second other people's advice to call or text a help line, tell them the situation and ask them how to get help.

462,What does support look like?,"A kinda weird question.

How do you know if your family/a parent is ""supporting and accepting and respecting"" your gender identity, or just saying they support and accept and respect you?

That's the bare minimum. Anyone who actively refuses to respect pronouns and a request for gender neutral language doesn't respect you and sure doesn't support you. That's gaslighting to claim they are"", ""If a friend/family member isn't even putting in effort to respect your chosen pronouns, that's definitely not supportive, even if they tell you otherwise. Adjusting can be hard, but supportive family members will make a clear effort even if they mess up sometimes. \n\nWatch their actions, trying to support and affirm your identity in practical ways is a great way to tell if someone is truly supportive! Will they stand up for you/correct someone using incorrect pronouns so you don't have to? Or maybe they notice things that you enjoy or make you feel affirmed and give (even small) gifts that relate to that. This is definitely a way I can tell with my own family! Another big sign that people around you are supportive is if they take time to educate themselves about your identity and the queer community. My parents or friends sometimes bring up conversations with me about queer topics they've been learning about, and their desire to know more and check in with me about that shows me that they are truly supporting me instead of saying empty words. \n\n(TL;DR if they put in effort/work on their own to support you better, then chances are they're truly supportive)"", 'For me the difference is clear between my sisters.

463,Pronouns and Gender - Advice,"I posted this same thing to r/queer but I just found this subreddit and thought it may be more appropriate here. 

Hi, I am somewhat of a baby queer and looking for advice on the correlation between pronouns and gender. Generally, I do feel pretty confident in me being a woman and using she/her pronouns but the other day I had to refer to myself as a girl and surprisingly it gave me pause. I am not sure that I am NB or genderqueer yet but I have been thinking about using she/they pronouns.

My attitude towards using neutral pronouns is mostly in the ""yeah, why not, feels just as correct as she /her"" category. If I don't think my gender will change can my pronouns change? Idk, this feels like a bit of a dumb question but any advice on the topic would be appreciated. Thank you!",vzuczd,13,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/vzuczd/pronouns_and_gender_advice/,"['People of any gender can use any pronouns they want', ""Pronouns are a form of expression, a presentation choice, something you *do*. Anyone can engage in any form of presentation they wish, regardless of gender. Some choose to conform to societal expectations and stereotypes based on perceived gender, and some do not. For example, a cis man who puts on a dress doesn't turn into a trans woman. Presentation doesn't define gender.\n\nA gender identity, in contrast, is something you *are*. It is what it is, innate to your experience of identity, regardless of whether or how you choose to express that.\n\nSo, if your gender changes, you don't have to change your pronouns. Conversely, you can change your pronouns without your gender changing. Two completely independent things."", ""Don't worry about labels and just do what makes you comfortable. If that is using she/they pronouns, then awesome! I used she/they pronouns but identified mostly as cis, but then over time I realized that I am cool with any pronouns with a preference for they/them and I now identify as genderqueer. Not saying that you'll identify as something else in the future if that's not how you feel, but just that it's perfectly fine to just take it day by day, figuring out how you feel most comfortable presenting yourself and being referred to, without worrying about defining your identity before you're ready, or even ever, if it's not something you feel inclined to do. Also, pronouns do not necessarily equal gender and gender identities are not mutually exclusive, so it is totally possible to identify as both a woman and nonbinary/genderqueer, or be a woman with she/they pronouns. :)""]"
464,"Is anybody else not attracted to cismen, but attracted to masc presenting genderqueers and transmen and ciswomen and, well, a lot queer folk? Is this OK?","I ask this because I sometimes I question what's going on. I don't feel like a *real* genderqueer (or queer for that matter) a lot of the time (but a lot of the time I do). I was assigned male and present male to most normies. Queer folks often read me right, though. I have a background of abuse that probly doesn't allow me to be fully aware of my sexuality and gender. It also makes me weird about penises. But I'm really into queer sex, penetration, etc. Maybe I just feel safer being intimate with someone who wasn't raised male.

I am attracted to cis gay men and cis effeminate men sometimes, but it's not really sexual. It's more that I want to be *like* them. Like I want to present femininity like they're able to. 

However, I often find transmen really attractive and I date queer a lot with masc queers. I often question this part of myself. Not that it's OK, because it's coming from an honest place. OK, maybe, I question whether it's OK. But mostly, I'm just trying to understand it. 

I'm in my forties. I didn't know anything about queerness beyond gay and lesbian until I was 27. Then I felt really validated. I started to realize that a lot of what I'd been experiencing wasn't that I was gay, but that I was queer, genderqueer. It took me until a long time after before I'd start calling myself queer, but I eventually did. 

I sometimes wonder if I hadn't of come up in a super oppressive Christian home, what my gender and sexuality would be like. If it would be the same. If there's parts of my sexuality that have been permanently turned off or if I'm just attracted to who I'm attracted to. 

Does anyone else struggle with this kind of stuff? Does anyone else have these kinds of questions about who they're attracted to?

468,Straight Cis Mom...,So last night I was talking to my mom about different gender identities and she actually discovered that she's genderfluid!,vy6c62,25,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/vy6c62/straight_cis_mom/,"[""That's crazy.

469,"Confused, please offer advice","Uhh Hi! I hope this works.. 

(afab if that's important) 

I think I've been feeling this way since I was a kid really, I'm 18 now. 

I really don't like feminine based pronouns or they/them, I much prefer masculine ones. 

I don't want (my body) be a man, look like a man (like body type and hair) unless I was like a really pretty guy or something idk. 

 I don't want my boobs but I also don't want a dick, I want nothing really but a vagina is better than a dick I guess. 

also don't want to look too much like a woman, I think my chest is the worst part, I just hate it. 

I want to be nothing, but something I want to be really feminine and others I want to be a guy. 

I've been told I'm not non binary because sometimes I feel like a boy whilst others I feel like a girl. 

also been told I'm not gender fluid because  sometimes I don't feel like a boy or a girl. 

I honestly just want to know why I feel like this and if there's a word/label for it since I haven't been able to find anything and feel really out of place. (found out I'm on the ace spectrum if that is relevant at all) 


If anything is offensive i apologise. I'm very new to this and grew up in a very sheltered Muslim household. My parents have no idea what lgbtq+ exept that some people are gay. (I tried bringing it up but it was just awkward, they aren't against it I don't think, they just don't get it)

Gender identity is something on the *inside* of you, like being hungry or left-handed or in love. No one can look at you from the outside and assign you a label and say ""you must identify this way"" or ""you may not identify this way."" That\'s gatekeeping elitism and it\'s bullshit.\n\nIf you feel like your internal experience of gender is changing over time, genderfluid might be a way to describe that experience. If you feel like your internal experience of gender doesn\'t fit *solely and completely* within either one of the two binary gender boxes, then non-binary is a word you could use to describe that experience. There are thousands of labels for different aspects of gender experience, and you\'re free to use any combination of labels that you feel will accurately describe how you feel. *You* get to choose.\n\nAlso worth noting that a lot of stuff on your list, like body parts and pronouns and hair, are not part of gender identity, but rather external presentation. Anyone can use they/them pronouns, for example, regardless of gender. External presentation choices can reflect one\'s internal gender experience, but they don\'t have to; presentation is a choice you make, something you *do*, but a gender identity is an experience you have, something you *are* regardless of whether and how you choose to express it.', 'genderfluid/nonbinary here! my parents still don‚Äôt really get it, but they are still there for me.\n\na lot of trans/nonbinary people choose to never transition. which surgeries or hormones you undergo is a deeply personal choice.\n\ncommunicating your preferred pronouns is a good way to go :)']"
470,gender queer? non-binary? gender fluid? messed up? (rant/vent),"I'm afab, just turned 30, and when I was young I was always more of a tomboy. I remember always being curious about the male genitalia and even tried to train myself to pee standing up when I was a child. But at the same time I also liked dresses, cuddly toys, the more feminine things.

When I was around 15 or 16 I remember thinking about how I wish I was a boy in a homosexual relationship (I identified as a bisexual at the time). I didn't necessarily want to BE a guy but I desperately felt like I would never be as happy or as satisfied or as comfortable as the idea of being in a mlm relationship. I got a boyfriend but the idea of anal never say right with me... The boyfriend (ex, now) spent a long time commenting on the slimness of my body, wanting me to have bigger boobs and to be more curvy and shut down the idea of me cosplaying as a male character. I did have an eating disorder back then, trying to keep myself as genderless as possible. I had a lot of hatred for my body, still do in many ways. 

Anyways, I recently discovered that when I felt attracted to those who are amab a majority of the time it's because I wanted to be them. I loved how they looked (androgenous and feminine looking amab people make me feel things) and a trans friend said I was experiencing gender envy. I hate how I look as a female but I wouldn't transition or anything because I still mostly identify as female, but I still have this deep, concrete notion of wishing, desiring, praying that I could also be in a gay (or bi/pan with a preference for males) relationship and feeling so sad and hopeless that it can't ever happen. 

I've had a boyfriend and a girlfriend and I absolutely adore females too and would call myself homoflexible but... I don't know. It's a mess. I feel alone and confused and anxious, like I'm insulting anyone who is amab, afab, those under the trans umbrella, those who love the same sex as them, xyz.

I eventually decided to transition in my early 20s and while it felt great to let my fem side out I was plagued by doubts about my transness. I experienced crippling dysphoria due to my male secondary sex characteristics to the point where I self harmed because I thought I might as well make myself as ugly as possible.

Nothing really seems to fit though which I find a bit worrying as I like to have a bit of clarity about myself and about who I am.
I feel like I'm nothing or something and it changes a bunch but I want to be seen as nonbinary or like 'neutral' (probably poorly worded) by other people but I don't know how to and also how to see myself as more of me.

I\'ve been on T for the past year, and despite my deepened voice, partially buzzed haircut, ""masc"" coded clothing, and faint mustache, I still constantly get ""ma\'amed"" when I\'m in any kind of retail situation like a store or restaurant. And I have a feeling that most people at work still view me as they did before just with some slight physical alterations and a new name.

I also like what u/EggplantContent3427 said about seeking out androgynous-specific look ideas. That might help. But ultimately confidence is something you grow into, often slowly, and it can take a lot of trial and error to achieve. One tactic I heard of recently, for dealing with gender dysphoria, was to make a concerted effort, when looking in a mirror, to focus on the physical features or parts of your gender expression you like that DON\'T make you dysphoric. So for you these could be whatever about your face, body, hair, style, etc. that has that fluid look you\'re going for. The key is to focus on those rather than honing in on the ones that fill you with unease and dissatisfaction. So I\'ve been doing that recently and have found it has helped my confidence and some of those ma\'ams sting a little less. There\'s no one quick fix, but strategies like that can help at the margins.

487,Thinking about my gender is keeping me up at night (rant/ramble),"As the title suggests, this is essentially just me rambling about my gender identity struggles! I'm 22 and I didn't really think much about my gender until late 2020, but I've always dressed quite feminine and identified as (still identify as???) a femme lesbian. When I started thinking about my gender more it was more in the context of vague disconnection with being perceived as conventionally feminine when it's really that I just think dresses and pink are fun but my gender didn't quite align with that. I started going by any pronouns but secretly preferred they or he over anything else. At some point I told my close circle to use they/he for me, used any pronouns at school, and I still use only she/her around family.

But lately (like the past six months) I've been experiencing more chest and period related dsyphoria and I have compression tops and a binder for when that happens. There are some days where I'm just very loosely not a girl and other days where I wince if someone calls me one. I guess I'm vaguely genderfluid, but I don't know how to describe the gender where I wince, like I don't think I'm a guy but occasionally I want top surgery and bottom growth (not that wanting those things necessarily makes you a guy). I don't even know if I'm guy adjacent (which if I am makes the whole sexuality part confusing), but I can't tell if I'm just forcing myself to think yes I am sometimes a guy or no I'm not because I'm a lesbian. 

At this point thinking about my gender is keeping me up at night, and the only people I feel comfortable talking about it with are people who don't know me irl, because people online don't have preconceived notions about how i dress and I feel like if people knew that provided I'm not extra  dysphoric, I'm probably wearing a very feminine dress or outfit, they wouldn't take my pronouns seriously. At this point I'm almost considering using exclusively he/him pronouns to my close friends because I don't like how often they avoid using that pronoun set. I'm also considering changing my name to something more masculine just because I like the contradiction of looking and dressing how I do and having a ""guy's name."" I think right now I just really don't like people perceiving me as a girl, but I'm not masculine!! I don't want to be!! I want my feminine clothing to be divorced from gender so I don't feel as dysphoric as I do sometimes and I want to figure out what the fuck is going on with my gender in general. I don't need specific labels but I would like a rough idea.

Okay this has gotten very long, but yeah my gender is literally keeping me up at night right now in this moment and I needed to spill it all out somewhere because I'm for some reason embarrassed to be struggling with it.

488,"Discovering Gender Euphoria, wondering what I am and if I'm 'allowed'","Hi,

(TLDR: Discovered gender euphoria as an older man but unsure what I am and my entitlement to be queer or nonbinary or ...)

A couple of years ago I went through major life changes and started a new relationship in which my partner has been very accepting and encouraging about my exploring my gender identity. But I feel I am on a never-ending journey with it and get very confused and despairing sometimes. I feel like I talk about it too much with them and it might get overwhelming and it feels like I'm being narcissistic and self-indulgent. So I thought I'd try and write some of it out here, sorry if it's rambling.

Since my partner was fine with having fun with gender and trying stuff out, during a certain period early in our relationship, I started experimenting more with crossdressing. At first it felt like it was something sexual, a fetish, something I'd flirted with before in my life but without really thinking about it much.

Then it became something more, and during a period when we were not together I really started almost compulsively buying tights and skirts and leggings, and eventually I went out for the first time in a skirt. It was really scary, of course, I went out it for a few minutes, at night, then gradually more.

This became something that I realised more and more felt 'right' for me. Eventually I realised basically no one out there really cared that much what I was wearing, and the relation to, or fear of, other people became less important than my relation to myself. I recognised that it made me feel better in an important way.

I figure that the reason why it had felt predominantly like a sexual thing was just that dangerous feeling of 'crossing a line'. Once I was across that line, it opened up new feelings, the feelings that many have described as euphoria, a sense of calm, a feeling of it being right for me, a happy kind of excitement about myself - things I had definitely never felt before, as I am coming from a long struggle of self-doubt, anxiety, and even self-hatred.

Going further than clothes, I also recently got waxed which feels amazing. I have experimented a bit with makeup but it's not really something I am into much. Here's the thing: although I like seeing myself looking in some respects 'feminine', and I love exploring ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs‚Äô clothes, I really find the idea of trying to 'be a woman' is not for me any more than 'being a man'.

I think it is related to autism and a hypersensory bias too, bc it's not primarily about ‚Äòpresenting‚Äô to others, even, it's really the physical sensual feelings that make me feel happy and comfortable in myself. Like recently I got a delicate ankle bracelet and it makes me feel so good to wear it, way out of proportion to the thing itself! And now when I dress in 'normal' men's clothes, i am very conscious that they're drab, they're harsh, rough, imprisoning. I always felt 'being a man' (in the 'proper way') is like having the weight of a terrible crime on your shoulders all the time, it mostly always felt like a shameful and gruelling task. I now love going into a store and just totally ignoring the dull grey, black, blue men's section. In short, I feel freed from something very oppressive that I thought was just 'how life is'.

But it has been difficult to work through. Especially since i am not young, and I have lived a life as a cis hetero man. Luckily I had my partner and some trans friends online who were happy to discuss my questioning with me and reassured me, when it felt destabilising, that it's 'ok for something to make you feel good'!

I wondered for a while whether I was actually trans, and I was scared would gradually realise I was, and my life would be massively disrupted (and I am terrified of surgery!). But I have never really wanted to 'be a woman' or pass as a woman, it's more that I get a calm euphoric feeling when I dress how I want, and it's really pleasurable to open up this whole world of clothes and nail polish and girliness etc. that was always totally another world for me that I couldn't enter. I am getting to know my body and how clothes fit and what looks good and what I like.

What I love is that I've found I am creating a new outward me that is truly expressing the particular form of sensuality and internal feelings that I have. I even find that the things I was formerly attracted to in women, are actually things I want to inhabit myself. Like, as if I actually wanted to feel those things I desired from ‚Äòinside‚Äô, to feel like a woman in certain respects rather than to 'have' a woman.

I'm not sure it's 'genderfluid' either, because I never really have a day when I particularly want to dress like a man. Dressing like a man is never a positive desire for me, it's more a drab boring default that I can cope with if that's what's needed.

So, I am dressing in a way where it's obvious I'm a ‚Äòbiological man‚Äô but I have no regard for what men are ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô to wear, and I try to mix the soft, gentle, girly side in without it looking like I'm trying to pass as a woman. From a normie point of view I am quite obviously 'a man wearing women‚Äôs clothes'.

Am I 'non-binary' then? or 'genderqueer' or what? I am trying to work it out and find a way to feel like I am legitimate and entitled to claim some kind of queerness for myself.

When this started, or when I couldn't ignore it any more, I was like, uhh I'm not trans, I don't 'have dysphoria'. But one of the things I am coping with is that I found that, once I had the euphoric experiences, the dysphoria has spread backwards in time: I mean that the more I experience this feeling of calm and well-being, the more confident and happy with myself I become, the more I realise what a large part this gender dysphoria has played in my life before, and I didn't recognise it as such.

I'm getting a more secure grip on it now. Recently, because of family stuff, there were a couple of times I had to spend a week or so dressing 'normal', and I really understood very harshly what people mean by dysphoria. I shocked myself just how good it felt when I was finally able to put on a skirt again and go out and feel that freedom and happiness. Maybe it is also a kind of stress relief, I know cross dressers often say that. But it seems more than that, it does seem connected to identity and to my past.

I've spent a lot of my life being withdrawn, depressed, and anxious and here is something that makes sense of it, because as a small kid I was often mistaken for a girl, and as I grew up I was very quiet and I never liked sports etc., I've always been uncomfortable around boys, doing boy's stuff, and then trying to 'be a man'. It got worse, in fact, I would squirm in any kind of situation where I was expected to be a man among men. As a kid I also never felt entitled to explore inside the girls‚Äô world instead because where I was living was just so heteronormative and there was no space for anything different, so it seemed like this was just what life was. I guess all that was gender dysphoria.

It has made me look back on my teenage years, and remembering that growing up in a shitty small town, my first expressions of sexuality were toward other boys and were quickly rebuffed. I didn‚Äôt have any information or awareness of queerness (except that I guess I was a kid during the AIDS epidemic so homosexuality was connected, if anything, to death and fearmongering). So it was clear to me that that any exploration of being with boys just wasn't going to happen, and in the end I found I liked girls and that was the easier path so I ended up identifying as cis hetero all my life. I'm now waking up to the fact that I am bi, and I feel more comfortable acknowledging I am attracted to men than to women, although mostly feminine men (yes, watching happy dancing femboys on TikTok played a large part in my 'awakening', lol!). I enjoy taking the passive role too and fantasise about being with men. But I have never had dysphoria in the sense that I hated my body or my genitals or physically being a man, I'm quite happy with what i have. I recently heard someone talk about 'social dysphoria' vs 'body dysphoria' and yeah that seems to be it, it is more to do with a horror of the social role, but also like I said, the sensory dimension.

Of course I am incredibly lucky and super happy that my partner is able to accept all of this and we have explored it together. If it weren't for them (also a nonbinary cute tomboy who has always been quite gender nonconforming ) I would not have got this far.

I have got used to going out dressed in the clothes I want to wear, and have experimented and built up my wardrobe and it still makes me feel really good. In contrast to what a lot of people report, I have never had any really negative experiences, it has increased my self confidence, and in fact I have got more unsolicited positive comments about my appearance and smiles in the street than I ever got as an unhappy man-dressing man who just wanted to be invisible. I have a nonbinary-presenting instagram which is semi-disconnected from the rest of my life, but honestly I don't have any fear about people 'finding out' any more, I feel confident enough to say if they have a problem, it's their problem not mine.

So, this is all a happy story, to put it positively it's like a flower that keeps opening up and revealing new desires and new possibilities to me. But then sometimes it feels like an endless hole I'm falling into and it's destabilising and takes up a lot of my time thinking and feeling and dealing with it. At age 40+ it's a lot to cope with to re-evaluate and re-process my whole being. There was a moment in my life when I was able to start over, and that coincided with a general shift in the culture around gender, and I was able to think it through and all of this exploded for me.

But the thing is, I have never really been around queer or LGBT people much and so I feel like a fraud or an impostor and continually go through cycles of getting the euphoria and it feels so real, and then dismissing it as just delusional and feeling that I should be embarrassed 'at my age', i must look stupid, etc. I am even considering deleting this because it just feels self-indulgent and silly and somehow fraudulent. I feel like I need some more social feedback and contact with others to affirm who I am, which I'm trying to pursue IRL, but that's also a part of why i'm reaching out here, maybe just being able to discuss it a bit would help.",vsmkz1,12,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/vsmkz1/discovering_gender_euphoria_wondering_what_i_am/,"[""Hello:) My comment may not be of any reassurance, seeing as I'm not yet at your stage of presenting as myself socially.

Self-discovery is an ongoing process that takes place throughout your entire life. If you ever stop discovering new things about yourself, it usually means you\'ve stopped looking closely enough. Sometimes those realizations are really big, like gender. That just means you looked at it from a different angle this time. Remember that humanity spent thousands of years simply assuming that the planets moved in weird loop-de-loops, and it wasn\'t until Copernicus that somebody looked from another angle and saw that if everything went around the Sun, then the planets could just be moving in simple circles.\n\nIf you are debating with yourself about whether or not you\'re faking something, you\'re never faking it.

490,Advice on getting a non-gender conforming haircut and talking to Hairdressers?,"So I need some advice and I'm not sure where to ask about it.

**Backstory**

I don't currently identify as anything but I also don't know what I am.  I'm AMAB and I get a ton of gender envy when it comes to women, when I see someone interesting and attractive I both want to go out with that person and **be** that person at the same time.  I love female fashion and style as well.

If you gave me the magic button test ""push this button, become a women zero complications no cost"" I'd do it in a heartbeat.  However in reality I don't think my quality of life going through with all of that,and being broke and not fully accepted, would be better than what it is now so here I am stuck in limbo.

Either way I don't think this is something I'm ever going to figure out, and it's likely just something I'm going to have to live with.

**Current Quantifiable Problem**

I'm getting my life back on track.  I've gotten a 1/2 decent job, working for someone who isn't an asshole, I'm losing weight and I've got my own place.  I want to turn over a new leaf in my life and start doing things because **I** want to do them, not because someone else expects or wants me to.

[I have quite long hair](https://imgur.com/a/2BlR1ET), it's down to about chest length and it does give me a bit of gender euphorbia sometimes.  I'll get compliments on it like once every few months and those always make my day/week/month/year.  However I haven't had it cut in like 7 years and I really want to start changing things up.  I get a lot of social anxiety so I do a lot of googling/research before I do anything so I managed to find a hair salon in my local area that does cuts based off of length, not gender.  I got an appointment booked in like 2 weeks with a stylist that is non-binary.

Currently leaning towards getting a long-shag style cut, with the possibility of playing around with highlights/coloured highlights in the future, but I'm not sure yet.

How am I supposed to tell the stylist that I'm interested in getting a long cut, in what's traditionally a ""feminine"" style and I don't care that it's a traditionally feminine hairstyle, and that I'm looking for more androgynous/feminine leaning suggestions?  Like you'd think it would be easy based off of the place/person I'm going to but I've got a traditionally male name and, besides having long hair, I present as a traditionally male person.  I'm not concerned what looks good on me ""as a guy,"" I want what looks good on me ""as a person.""

494,"Recently came out at non-binary, and processing.","Hey reddit! I wanted to reach out and find my people. Recently had an epiphany that turned my life around and I want to share my story.

I'm mid 30s and AFAB and mostly okay with it - except when I haven't. I've had gender dysmorphia from a very young age and over time stuffed it down with the label ""I was just made wrong"". My earliest years of school I always wanted to play with the boys, and felt like a fraud with girls. I was extremely resentful that I was born female.

I grew up in the LDS/Mormon church, and as the uninitiated may not know, it's extremely gender binary. Men hold the leadership power, women get married and raise children. Every Sunday men wear suits and women wear dresses. When a kid turns 12 they move out of the co-ed kids class and into sex-subdivided classes, and that's when I started to struggle. The teachings are very homophobic (sometimes covertly). I was extremely devout until I got to 16, and my doubts started to mount until I stopped attending at 18.

I think I was able to distract myself after that. I went to college to go into video games, met lots of interesting, creative, queer people, and went into the workforce. Unfortunately, that industry is plagued by misogyny, and for additional reasons I am currently not working in it. I'm not sure if I miss it or not.

I got married to an awesome guy. We had a kid, and my world turned upside down. I knew I needed to process my post-religion status. I did not want my former religion to plague them too. Then less than a year later, COVID happened.

We all know how that went. It was rough trying to make sure my toddler received proper socialization while we were quarantining. We made it work.

But over the years, I've been struggling to find myself. I love being a mother, but I forgot how to prioritize myself. I have been trying to get back into art and have been writing stories again (I've always wanted to write children's books). I felt so stuck. I was feeling anxious all the time, depressed, confused. I got a therapist while I was pregnant because my gender dysphoria was through the roof. I fucking hate being pregnant. I don't like how people treat me as an invalid, how I get gendered as hyper feminine, and the whole culture around it.

I've honestly known for years I'm non-binary. The happiest time of my life was childhood, simply because I was carefree, creatively expressive, and felt pretty secure in myself for the most part. I didn't care about my gender. I really struggled when I hit puberty. I was terrified of growing breasts and being seen as a woman - moreso, an object of sexual desire. I hid in baggy clothes - in fact, I never really developed a sense of style as I am the youngest in a large family so I always wore hand-me-downs. I was honestly always being bombarded by criticism from my friends that I wasn't dressing ""feminine"" or ""trendy"" enough. (We're still friends. I've forgiven them that.) There were messages all along that ways I really preferred to be weren't right.

Anyway, this is long-winded. Bottom-line, my best friend came out as bi, and while I was initially like ""WTF??"" I immediately changed to ""...well, duh."" And I got to talking once again about what I've always suspected in a private conversation with her. Then I sort of mentioned it to my husband.

Click.

Holy shit, I really am non-binary, aren't I?

It's as if the clouds parted and illuminated the world. Everything makes sense. Everything feels better. The future feels brighter. I've been less volatile, more upbeat, more like I used to be. I've been feeling a surge of creativity unlike ever before. I came out on social media yesterday.

I've been socialized so long as a woman that I'm fine with my birth name and she/her pronouns... for now. I'm comfortable with the woman's body I'm in but I don't see myself that way. I've always been interested in people as people, not as their sex or gender. I find people fascinating.

Anyway... thanks for reading this far. I feel clueless in this new world, and am curious if anyone has had similar experiences.

496,I'm AFAB but I feel like a man...but I don't think I'm trans? What gender identity would this be?,"First time poster here. I'm super nervous. I'm AFAB but I dress exclusively masc because when I wear femme clothes I feel like I'm in drag. I disassociate when people call me ""lady"" (I literally look behind me to see who they're talking about haha!), I don't identify at all with society's expectations of what it is to be a woman.

I thought I'd ask you awesome people on here as I've literally just had a great conversation with my wife about gender (they're AFAB, non binary, she/they). I'm not sure if I'm trans as I'm very comfortable in how I express myself, I'm largely comfortable with my body (apart from the wearing of femme clothes) and I would call myself a lesbian. But for the last decade or so, I've been on a journey in my mind. I can't quite figure out my gender or even which pronouns I'd like to use. Just any kind of guidance would be awesome. I know you can't go inside my head and tell me what gender to be, but any ideas would be much appreciated. 

Thank you!

I grappled with my gender identity for a long time, and it was scary at times, but honestly it doesn\'t have to be. It\'s okay to kind of try on gender stuff, play around with it, and find what works for you and what doesn\'t. There aren\'t any rules, really. \n\nFirst things first, body dysphoria is not required in order to be trans. We all experience social dysphoria in one way or another, but body dysphoria is an individual experience. Some trans people have a lot of it, some of us only have a little (or are dysphoric about some aspects of our bodies but not others), and some of us don\'t have it at all. \n\nPersonally, I identify as a guy (mostly). I use he/him and they/them pronouns. I dress primarily in masculine clothing. I have short hair and a ""masc"" name that I chose for myself. My mom calls me her son. But I\'m pretty okay with my body and how it works. I\'m just a man with breasts and a vulva, that\'s all. There are lots of men with those features. I\'m cool with it. \n\nThere are definitely some gender spaces that exist somewhere in between being a trans man and being a butch lesbian, especially since so many trans guys existed in the sphere of dyke-ness before realizing we\'re trans, and that can still be an important part of our experience with queer culture and relationships. There are trans men who still call themselves dykes, and there are lesbians who identify as women but use he/him pronouns as a badge of their butchness. \n\nAll of this is just to say that while there are labels and terms and boxes that exist in conversations about gender, those things are just touchstones to help us find ourselves. If none of them work exactly right for you, that\'s fine. You can exist between and around them. You can make up your own gender terms if you want. It\'s all good. \n\nBut if it helps, here are some terms you might want to look up and read about, to see if they give you any insight on how you\'re feeling:\n\n\\-Demiboy\n\n\\-Butch (more specifically, I would highly recommend checking out Leslie Feinberg\'s definition of, and commentary on, the non-gendered nature of butchness as a queer identity)\n\n\\-Transmasculine\n\nI hope this helps!', 'There are non-binary women, any the butch suggestion send reasonable as well.', 'Sounds like me, which is ‚Äòbutch‚Äô.

497,My recent realization of identity.,"I am 42, married to the same cis-gendered man for 20 years in October. I was born intersex, although not overtly. I was assigned female at birth, as I have a vagina and that was that, until I turned 13 with no sign of puberty even getting close to visiting. I was taken to an endocrinologist, who determined that I had some sort of genetic condition. I was told that I had only half a uterus, and that they ""couldn't find my ovaries."" I was told I'd need exploratory surgery to ""find"" them.

I underwent the surgery and they told me that I had no ovaries, they didn't develop, and that I would need HRT to undergo puberty. I was given estrogen and some other hormones for several years and developed some B cup sized breasts.

Later, at 19 I requested my medical records and that's when I found out that during the ""exploratory"" surgery they actually removed vestigial testes. In the record it actually said that they did not inform ""patient or their parents"" of this. I also found out that my genetic karyotype was 46, XY which is commonly considered male.

It hit me like a ton of bricks and took years for me to deal with the ensuing emotional turmoil.

Now however, in my middle age I look back and kind of realize that I always straddled a line between the genders. When I was 5 a kid asked me if I was a boy or a girl and I replied without thinking that I was 1/2 boy and 1/2 girl. 

When I was in college I had short, spiky hair, and dressed in jeans and a wrestling or video game shirt most of the time. I had a part time job at a medical library and was often called ""the little boy that works here.""

I stopped taking hormones later, at 25 when I had to have a hysterectomy to remove my half uterus due to it being pre-cancerous. After this I started realizing that in my head I have both genders, sometimes at once, sometimes not. My friends mostly refer to me as a spazcat. I have recently decided that I accept all pronouns (she/her, he/him, they/them, or any others). I answer to ma'am or sir, and generally look however I want most of the time, I might wear a dress or I might wear cargo shorts and a video game shirt, it depends on the day.

I wanted to share my story because I believe it's important not to hide something like this in the shadows out of embarrassment or concern for what people think. I will tell complete strangers in line at the grocery store all of this if it comes up. Most of my coworkers know or have heard from others.

I feel like my manly features make me uncomfortable to be feminine, like I'm not feminine enough. But even when I present masc, I feel like an imposter, like I'm not tall or strong enough to be a guy. 

I have wondered if I'm a trans woman, but I'm afraid to start transitioning and then feel masc again. Like sometimes I wish I had boobs, sometimes I like to have chest hair. But I wonder if I'd been born AFAB, I feel like I'd be just happy to be a woman and that maybe I was conditioned into my masculinity by years living as a man in a man's body. But I don't feel like I can get rid of my masculinity, and often I enjoy being a guy, I just feel like I'm not good enough at it.

502,Very gender fluid,"... but with some loose ends. So I am REALLY gender fluid. At first I thought I was non-binary for a few years, then upon doing some intense reversal of repression, I became a trans woman, then I found that I had alternating moods of emotional toughness that really feel masculine (and good). The euphoria while being a trans woman had me convinced that this was my only gender state, it was so profound. And now I found that I have a 3rd gender state, sort of an agender state, as well as the other two. At times the masculine state feels depressed, but it also seems to have its own positive, strong and confident identity.

I'm still going to go to a therapist and probably try HRT, at least for a few months. I have a lot of reasons for this, and a lot of friends in my gender fluid groups who are doing the same. For one thing I prefer the ""feminine"" emotional gender state, and I'm hoping that HRT would make me more emotionally open and able to experience her more. Also, I would like to present feminine most of all. I've seen some beautiful MTF transformations. The odd thing about my ""masculine"" state is that when I look at pictures of people doing testosterone, I am repulsed and sickened. Looking at people doing estrogen makes me start crying... in jealousy. So I am definitely tilted towards being a trans woman still. There's a whole bunch other ways in which I prefer femininity across the board. Which makes me think that my ""masculine"" side may be something like what a butch lesbian experiences...

504,Questions about binding,"Okay so this may get a little ranty so apologies beforehand, I will put a tldr at the bottom

I‚Äôve been considering getting into binding recently. One of my main concerns though is bringing this up with my mom. My mom has always been (for the most part) supportive of my sexuality and more recently my gender. For context, I‚Äôm afab and use she/they pronouns, however I lean into they/them more. I came out to my mom as genderqueer a few months ago and she was relatively supportive if not a little confused at first and she had a lot of questions about whether this meant I was trans (I don‚Äôt really identify with that label though I know a lot of nbs do), if this meant I was a boy (it does not, I never find myself wanting or using he/him pronouns) and a lot of other questions/concerns of the sort. My mom kind of follows the mindset of being supportive of trans people and is very supportive and as always provided a safe space for my trans friends but would not know what to do if I myself was trans.

So that‚Äôs where we get to binding, despite the fact I‚Äôm afab and use she/they pronouns, I frequently go through periods of pretty strong dysphoria, a lot of which gets directed towards my body, particularly my chest. And I think binding is something that would just make me a lot happier with the I way I like to present myself and just the way I see my body. 

The problem is that I don‚Äôt know how to bring this up with my mom without her immediately assuming I‚Äôm trans. My mom really prides herself on having a daughter and despite not caring that other people use they/them when referring to me, she herself does not (which is a whole other can of worms) And since coming out anytime I bring up my gender identity there‚Äôs immediately this suspicion that I am trans and this whole genderqueer thing is just some transitional label or something. I just really want her to understand that‚Äôs not the case, it just isn‚Äôt how I identify and I want her to see how I actually identify, if that makes sense.

So my question to you all is any ideas on how I can bring up my desire to bind with my mom? 

Also any tips for beginning binders or where to start? I‚Äôve done baseline research but would also like hearing from other people.

Hope that made sense, if not I can definitely clarify things in the comments, thanks!

I've also heard good things about for them and the tomboyx compression top. That one's not a binder technically and it looks like a sports bra. I know underworks runs more true to size then gc2b.

Just see if she is able to understand that you dont mind she/her but you prefer they/them and see if she is willing to use them interchangeably or something. Also gc2b binders are fantastic in my opinion. They do stretch out over time and you have to buy a new one every once in a while but other than that I love them. They compress great but are not that uncomfortable and they come in half tanks and tanks. If you have a bigger chest i would recommend a tank binder (as long as you dont wear anything like crop tops). Make sure you measure before you order too, you dont want to get the wrong size, a small binder can be very harmful and cause bruising and even broken ribs but a big binder can just not compress enough and still give you dysphoria.

516,"Thinking of transitioning feminine, but not sure","Hello. I recently discovered I may not be cis, which was a surprise. I have been thinking of transitioning feminine, but I have some reservations.

The main one is that I don't want to give up some aspects of my maleness. I like my beard. My penis is convenient for peeing.

I have been growing my hair long, wearing pink and dresses. It feels nice but not amazing. I hope to start HRT in the next few months. See how I feel on that.

I like the idea of having boobs and a vagina. Although sometimes it's hard to imagine as really possible.

I am also reluctant to join the world of women/cis femaleness. It feels repellant to me. I suppose it's like enjoying playing a sport but not liking any of the teams.

Obviously I don't have to transition to fully female, I can go as far as I want. I guess part of me wants to go far, and part of me doesn't.

It would be nice to have someone to talk with about this. I don't have any friends I can talk about it with, and I can't find any suitable counsellors.

518,Dysphoria as an ace person,"I'm having so much trouble sleeping recently.
I'm female, she/her cuz that's what people say when they see me, closeted pan ace I guess.

Sometimes I'm not sure if my dysphoria comes from my body or the way society treats me, or both...or the fact that I'm asexual.

I definitely dislike all my lady parts, and although I wish I had a flat chest I definitely wouldn't want a penis either.
I guess I wish I looked more androgynous.
 
I struggle a lot with clothing, I don't like baggy, I don't like it too tight..... I'm not sure if I would be happy being one gender or the other physically.

Sexually, it doesn't matter. I'm so not interested, and at this point I don't know if it's my hormonal birth control messing up my brain (mirena) so I don't get any periods or if it's really who I am.
I'm afraid to take it out, periods also depress me but I'm 4 years in since I got this IUD and I'm afraid it's changing the way I think.
Always dated men but every year I accept more and more the fact that I'm not interested sexually and the chances of liking someone that will accept that are just basically one in a million. 

On the other hand I also hate being treated like a woman. The feeling some other dude might get the promotion instead even though the only difference is the way we look, or the comments people say in any conversation where it's clear we are different. 

But is society the reason I hate my body ? 
Or the other way around? 
Or is it my asexuality that has me in this weird ass lame limbo?

All things that wouldn't change being a he or a they considering I still look like a woman, and being called they wouldn't really change how society treats me, if anything it would exclude me even more.

Maybe I'm rambling like most posts here but I guess I really need help figuring out how to be happy and don't know where to start.

So recently I‚Äôve started questioning my gender. I‚Äôm AFAB, use any pronouns, and thought I was fully cis until around last week because I‚Äôve never had gender dysphoria. 

I‚Äôve always felt uncomfortable wearing traditionally feminine stuff (skirts, dresses, nail polish etc) and I thought I was just discovering myself, so to speak. 

Recently, I was joking around with my mother about ‚Äúnot needing a man ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm an independent woman‚Äù, but as soon I was about to say ‚Äúwoman‚Äù the words died on my tongue. I referred to myself as ‚Äúperson‚Äù instead and felt so much better. 

I‚Äôve been testing things out, and I‚Äôve realised every single time I refer to myself as a woman/girl/lady, my stomach churns. The same thing happens when my parents give me more traditionally ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù compliments, like pretty/dainty etc.

528,Confused about the point of gender,"I don't know how to feel. 

I've been questioning gender more and more these past year. And also what it means about me. 

I've never felt dysphoria, and the only reason I'm questioning my gender is because of my views on gender overall. I don't see the point. Why does it matter? I don't feel like it says anything about me. 
I don't feel uncomfortable with the ""woman"" label but that's probably a comfort thing, I don't know what ""woman"" means anymore. 
I'm okay with she/her pronouns as well because nothing else really fits. But, she/her doesn't really fit either? Nothing fits. 

Gender doesn't matter to me but being queer does. I don't want to be put with cishet people anymore because if gender doesn't fit, that is even MORE pointless to me. 

My problem here is, I don't like saying I'm a woman to people but I don't feel legitimate about saying anything else. Same time last year I wasn't asking these questions about myself, I was confident in the cisgender label. 
And again, the only reason I'm questioning my gender is because of philosophical debates with myself. 

I don't really know what I'm asking but if what I'm saying makes you want to react, please do, I really want/need to talk about it.

I was a regular listener to her radio show as well as her television series which she gave very explicit sex advice. Well, this one interview she spoke about how all female bodied people fantasize about having a penis particularly during oral sex or self stimulation of the clit; after all, our clits are undeveloped penises.\n\nNow for me, I have lived with extreme dysphoria my whole life but am also very open with my body and its sexual functions. So this insight had a profound impact on the acceptance of the body I was born with - even if I felt I was born in the wrong one - and was like the modern day validation of someone saying you are in fact normal. \n\nI too can fantasize about having a penis and get off even without touching myself. Just imagining getting head or hand job gets me going and masterbation often involves thinking about penetrating a woman; all of which feels very real thanks to my phantom penis. I should point out that I do not need to have dildo or the like to have sex. And as I am now approaching menopause that phantom penis is even more realistic being that I feel it every moment of each day.\n\nMy point in sharing this with you is to illustrate that this experience is absolutely normal.

I don't think my experience will be much help here since I'm trans, but I know there's trans people who are happy with their genitals as is, and there's cis people who would be happier with a different set (see first paragraph, though i will say some people just do it for better sensation, there's also some that just want a penis or something that looks like & can be manipulated like one)\n\n I really don't think gender, the body it's connected to, and expression is as strict as some people make it out to be.

532,Imposter Syndrome (?),"I (21, AFAB) started identifying as genderqueer around a year ago. Since then, I have gradually shifted from simple she/they pronouns to using ze/zir in queer spaces and they/she everywhere else. 

I have grown out my armpit hair and love the results, often colour in my sideburns and lip fuzz with makeup (even when I‚Äôm home alone) and move seamlessly between the ‚Äúmens‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù sections in clothing stores. Honestly, I‚Äôve never felt more confident, and I‚Äôm interested in clothes and makeup for the first time in my life. 

The other day a trans friend of mine called me trans, and since then I‚Äôve kind of been spiralling. Perhaps it‚Äôs due to transphobia dominating Australian media (which I despise, but maybe it‚Äôs getting to me) and the transmedicalist rhetoric I was exposed to in my adolescent years, but I‚Äôm developing a kind of imposter syndrome. I feel like I‚Äôm perhaps inserted myself into a space that is not meant for me (trans circles) and worry that I‚Äôm just a GNC lesbian that doesn‚Äôt have a trans experience. 

I would never go on testosterone, but if I could choose I‚Äôd like a slightly deeper voice, more muscle mass and thicker/darker facial hair. I quite like my breasts (smallish) because I can show them off some days with a push-up bra and easily hide them under trans tape/ a sports bra the next. In the bedroom, they give me no dysphoria. 

Theoretically I like the appearance of skirts but cannot bear to wear them after 13 years in a private Christian school. I also hate the way people expect me to act ‚Äòladylike‚Äô when wearing one and treat me differently when I do. 

My questions are:

1. Do you think I have a trans experience, or am I simply experiencing the detachment from femininity that comes with accepting a lesbian identity and doing away with the male gaze? 

2. Would it be out-of-place for me to refer to myself as trans, even though I haven‚Äôt completely forfeited certain aspects of womanhood and don‚Äôt plan on physically transitioning?

That‚Äôs what being genderqueer is for me. \n\nFor me ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is more of an experience than part of my identity. I‚Äôm seen as such, I was raised as such. But it‚Äôs not something innate to me so i don‚Äôt identify with it. Gender is not something biological, it‚Äôs stupid really. Once we abolish gender norms, you can‚Äôt really define what a woman is\n\nI‚Äôm bisexual and I definitely don‚Äôt want to live heteronormative life of a woman. I try to avoid it as I can. \n\nI identify with being genderqueer, but also i feel connection to women, we share socialization in interests. I love both communities: women and genderqueer people. I just love us genderqueers more that‚Äôs it', ""I want to start by saying, even if you are GNC cis (which I'll be honest I really don't think you are, but I really have no say in the matter) you can still be here while you figure things out, if there is any place to explore gender, it would be here with us. :)\n\nAlso, stay away from transmedicalists, if you look at my post you can see I was spiraling the another night with the exact same problem, and  I said the exact same things you did. Don't worry about them, from what I can see, most of us don't share those views, (though I understand wanting to be respectful of other peoples feelings, that's what made me doubtful too) and transphobes just don't deserve our time.\n\nTo answer your questions\n\n1. you know what you feel and you know your experiences and if it doesn't seem cis then you know best since they are your experiences.\n2. It is for you to decide ultimately if you want to label yourself that way, If you want to great, if you don't feel completely comfortable with it, that's okay too.  Most people in these subreddits are super cool and very accepting, and I doubt you'll be turned away. I feel like a good number of us that aren't binary still like aspects of our AGAB, and that's perfectly fine, and it's fine if you don't want to do anything in a medical sense.  You still belong here. I know I have actually been a little more comfortable with feminine things now, because I don't feel forced or like I have to perform.\n\nAlso it might help to do some reading, it helped me a lot. Things like the gender dysphoria bible.\n\nEdit: [genderdysphoria.fyi](https://genderdysphoria.fyi) (added the link)"", 'Haaarrrd relate. When I was quite freshly out I really shied away from calling myself or letting others call me trans.

I will say that clothes and hair are just clothes and hair and don‚Äôt really mean anything in isolation. It doesn‚Äôt *make* you trans to want a more masculine expression‚Ä¶ but being trans might make you want that.  \nI think the real question you need to ask yourself with this is if you‚Äôre asking because it doesn‚Äôt seem right to you, or if it‚Äôs more along the lines of thinking you don‚Äôt deserve it/haven‚Äôt earned it, or something like that.\n\n2)  Of course not. It‚Äôs just a word. The worst that‚Äôll happen is that at some point you‚Äôll realise it doesn‚Äôt properly describe you and stop referring to yourself as trans, and that‚Äôs absolutely fine.']"

535,can I be both transmasc and nonbinary?,"Hi, I'm Mykael, and I'm very confused about labels and I've been struggling with my identity for *over* a decade. I'm nearing my 30's and I am only just starting to discover who I really am as a person - my parents were very old-fashioned and were always against the idea that the kid they raised could be anything but a straight female.

I know that *I am* ***not*** a female. I have *not once* felt like a female despite what biology says. What I do feel is a constant fluctuation between male and no gender at all. I know as a kid I never felt like a female but I had always *wished* I was a boy - I just didn't know that I was actually allowed to want to be a boy (again, very old fashioned parents who didn't believe in anything that wasn't straight or what biology said).

It wasn't until high school where I was introduced to the LGBTQ community and learned that I could be a male if that's what I wanted/felt like. And that's what I've felt for years now and have wanted so desperately to be, but at the same time I also don't feel that, ya know?

I really hope this makes sense and that I could get some advice or help or whatever here, cause I really need at least one thing in my life to be clear. I'm tired of struggling with my identity. So yeah, can I be both a \[trans\]male and non-binary at the same time?

536,I'm really confused I think I might be tricking myself,I think I might be tricking myself. I'm pretty sure I'm a Femboy. For extra background context I used to go on egg_irl and for a while I thought I was a trans female but then I realized I'm probably just a cis Femboy as I want to sometimes present female but be male and I don't feel female or have dysphoria. But recently I came across this video on YouTube https://youtu.be/K3vSQgoYa6I and it's made me feel really confused. I probably just want to feel really special.  But apparently you can be non-binary without dysphoria?? How does  that work? I'm probably not trans I'm probably just tricking myself and confusing gender expression and gender. The idea of being another gender feels like playing pretend to me as I've been cis all my life. You can't choose to be trans right!? I'm just a really big trans ally who likes to present as gender non-conforming/ aesthetically. I haven't even done so that much yet as I'm not used to it!,vdjc0k,54,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/vdjc0k/im_really_confused_i_think_i_might_be_tricking/,"[""Perhaps we should start with some definitions.\n\nTrans describes an internal experience that doesn't align solely and completely with one's AGAB. If you were AMAB, and feel 100% masculine 100% of the time and 0% anything else, you could use cis and GNC to describe yourself. But if you don't feel 100% masculine 100% of the time and 0% anything else, that would fall under the trans umbrella.\n\nThere's nothing in that definition about experience dysphoria. Feeling uncomfortable due to circumstances around your gender isn't a requirement to be any gender, because that would be circular.\n\nSimilarly, non-binary describes an internal experience of gender that doesn't fit solely and completely in either of Western society's two traditional gender boxes. Since that typically includes one's AGAB (unless assigned non-binary at birth), all non-binary identities fall under the transgender umbrella. All non-binary people are trans, by definition.\n\nAgain, no mention of dysphoria in there at all. And no mention of presentation either: trans and non-binary people can present themselves in any way they choose, and still be valid in their identities. Your gender is what it is, regardless of whether or how you choose to express it. A cis man who puts on a dress doesn't turn into a trans woman; presentation doesn't define gender, it's merely an optional way of expressing on the outside how you feel on the inside. Presentation is something you *do*, but a gender identity is something you *are*.\n\nIt's also okay to not have it figured out yet. There's no time limit on figuring out which labels you feel comfortable with for describing your experiences. We're all changing and evolving and learning more about ourselves and the world around us. It's only natural that the language we use to describe ourselves would evolve right along with the rest of us. So, don't get too caught up on finding the perfect label. Just spend some time exploring how you feel."", 'When it comes to gender, i think starting from a a need to find the perfect term can confuse the whole joint quite a bit. I think it‚Äôs a lot easier to figure things out when you take the pressure off yourself to know the ‚Äúright answer‚Äù to what your gender is and instead just try out different things and see what feels right. Try out different presentations, different pronouns, haircuts, hang out with some trans girls, non-binary folks, ask people what it‚Äôs like to take hormones, and see what feels good and what feels bad. Once you have an idea of what gender things work for you, then if you still want to have a term for your gender you might feel less like you‚Äôre ‚Äútricking yourself‚Äù and more like you tried stuff out and landed somewhere. Also, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really possible to ‚Äútrick yourself‚Äù that you‚Äôre one gender over another‚Äîthey‚Äôre really just words that help people convey their experiences in a succinct way. Like, some older more masc presenting queer folks who identify as dykes cuse that‚Äôs the language they had when they‚Äôre were younger probably actually have similar gender experience on the inside to younger folks who identify as non-binary or trans masc bc that‚Äôs more commonly known about today. Make the language work for you, it isn‚Äôt really important at all and is in fact counter productive to do it the other way around and make yourself fit into the language.

537,"Struggle dating a cishet man, in a tough situation and would like some advice","I need some dating advice, I am dating a cishet man please take it easy on me.
I‚Äôm a minor, afab, trans and nonbinary. Warning this is kinda long?

I am dating this guy and he says he respects me and my identity. I don‚Äôt know much about politics but he always involves politics with me being non binary/part of the lgbtq+ community and Mexican and It personally really annoys me cuz I don‚Äôt want that to be the only thing I am to him but he tells me that‚Äôs just how it Is in society and that those two things I am and are always going to be considered political and a debate and that there‚Äôs no going around that. 

It has come to my attention that he is in these groups and other subreddits that are about his political views. He encouraged me to check the subreddit to prove to me what his real views are and to not listen to what Google tells me because the media tries to make his views look bad/hateful.

I checked the subreddit to see what his ‚Äúcontroversial opinions that would get him in trouble‚Äù were and what I found alarming were all these hateful and really harmful stereotyping posts about trans and nonbinary people and it ended up being worse than I could imagine
It unfortunately made cry, one of the things really got to me which is weird I‚Äôm usually pretty tough but it was so personal and mocking and it left me second guessing everything and made me feel really just goofy and invalid. Then in response to all this he was like ‚ÄúI know most of it is hateful but I don‚Äôt agree with most of it‚Äù contradicting himself that he didn‚Äôt think was a hateful group and that the media was making it out to be hateful, when it was. (Proof being that he admitted to it).

I need help I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even asking we‚Äôve been together for 3 years he‚Äôs gotten a lot more political throughout these months and I feel like a kid and dumb around him and now I‚Äôm starting to doubt if he really takes me serious.

What do I do? And am I overreacting? how do I communicate this to him, if I tell him he is being racist/transphobic he‚Äôll tell me it isn‚Äôt and make me feel crazy because it‚Äôs just his ‚Äúcontroversial political opinion that no one is ready for‚Äù after all and that I‚Äôm supporting this preferential treatment stuff and I don‚Äôt really understand any of it. It‚Äôs only transphobic/homophobic/racist if he says it is but never if I say it is, even when it‚Äôs towards me!! When people tell me that he is wrong and when I confront him with the information  he tells me it‚Äôs the incorrect way. It seems like everyone else acknowledges he is racist and transphobic but him‚Ä¶ or me by how much he tells me he isn‚Äôt because he said so and it‚Äôs his opinion no one wants to hear but is the truth, idk what or who to believe anymore lol.

539,Please Help Me Advocate for my Niece/Nephew to Her/His Parents?,"***Pronouns in the title are intentional based on kiddos' preferences (I... think?)***

*Let me start out with full disclosure; I am a cis-gendered white woman in my mid-30s. I am privileged and have been spared by life's lottery many of the struggles that others deal with. I haven't been through what others have been through and so there will be aspects of your experience that have never even occurred to me. I'm here to learn. I am aware of my ignorance and hope to correct it through a mindful exchange of perspective and ideas.*

*I identify as an ally based on the belief that everyone has a human right to explore life in whatever way they're drawn to, so long as nobody is hurting each other. This includes gender identity, sexual orientation, and other philosophies and cultural norms/rules.*

*I agree many of today's gender norms are pretty toxic, so I'm in favor of our society looking at these social and cultural ideas as the intangible things they are and choosing to re-define and relax them so we can expand our state of being.*

*Please excuse me if I over-explain, am too formal, or talk too much, it is related to C-PTSD.*

\------------------------------------------------------------

My 15-year-old niece/nephew has come out as bi and gender-fluid with shifting pronouns, but her/his parents are both transphobic and homophobic.

The mother is a kind of ""fear-of-the-unknown"" phobic. Trans identity is so foreign to her that it freaks her out, plus it's condemned by her religion (not really, but since homophobia is, the church has lumped them in together.) She knows discouraging her kid would be wrong and is trying to adjust but she has severe anxiety due to C-PTSD (same source as me) so confronting her fears and stepping outside her comfort zone is harder for her than for some people. Her trauma-induced neurodivergence makes her associate phobia-based fear (and confronting it) with a real-life threat. She has a shut-down coping mechanism. ***This is not an excuse***, and she is seeking professional treatment, but that's going to be a long journey and her kid needs her to be able to address this issue productively *right now*.

The father is unapologetically a product of generations of hardcore conservative Christian extremist bigotry. His mother is from the Bible Belt and his father was Chilean, apparently from a sub-culture that was both conservative and oppressive to women. He is actually unwilling to change his perspective on this, feels he has a moral high ground, and ""his daughter"" is either mentally ill or a ""spoiled brat doing this because it's trendy"", etc. etc. etc. (Yes, I have told my sister that her husband is legit verbally abusive.)

They're both more upset about the gender identity than the sexual orientation.

The mom is taking a stand against her husband, in defense of their teen, but has expressed that she doesn't even understand (and is uncomfortable with) the issue she's defending. Kiddo has a key to my apartment if she needs an escape.

\------------------------------------------------------------

What I need help with is that I'm not familiar enough with the type of gender identity kiddo is expressing. I tried asking her/him about it but she/he has underdeveloped interpersonal skills and can't articulate clearly what she/he needs from us - which isn't helped at all by the dad being angry and yelling. Kiddo is withdrawing somewhat.

Kiddo says she/he identifies as gender-fluid, specifically female most of the time, but sometimes she/he just feels like a boy. She/he wants to go clothes shopping to get some masculine clothes for when needed. Preferred pronouns are ""She/Her or He/Him"" depending on current state of being.

While I get this in theory, in practice it's a little difficult because it's so internalized. Like, to be respectful and supportive should my sister and I ask what the pronouns are every time we interact with Kiddo? What if the father overhears and starts in? Would it be hurtful to use ""they/their"" if we're not sure? I get that She/He would not be appropriate when actually referring to Kiddo in person, but when referring to Her/Him in third person like this it feels logical. Please correct me if wrong.

I tentatively suggested to Kiddo, maybe, if the idea didn't make her/him uncomfortable... a reversible bracelet, to signal gender preference to close friends and family? Something that can be switched much faster and easier than changing clothes.

I'm not sure if that idea is something that would offend most other people, but for a kid living in a phobic household who has trouble communicating, maybe?

Gonna take Kiddo clothes shopping if the mom and dad won't.

***I don't really have a specific question, I'm looking for insight. Anyone else identify this way who can help me understand better, so I can help Kiddo and my sister?***

541,Complicated labels & stuff but I‚Äôll keep it lighthearted lol,"So basically I want to have a ~conversation~ and get some opinions/hear some other experiences that are relevant to what‚Äôs going on with me & my partner so here‚Äôs the story:

About 2 years ago my spouse and I both came upon the conclusion we‚Äôre gender non-conforming in our own special ways. We were one of those ‚Äústraight-passing‚Äù queer couples (both bi but AFAB/AMAB and usually presenting pretty femme/masc). We worked things out together and I felt at the time like I was (and am) non-binary and want to use they/them pronouns but didn‚Äôt start ‚Äúenforcing‚Äù it until about a year ago. My spouse on the other hand said they felt like ‚Äúa genderqueer person who didn‚Äôt care to deal with any changes‚Äù and continued to use he/him pronouns. 
Well ‚Ä¶ fast forward to now and my spouse is now my wife. I use she/her pronouns for her almost all the time. She told me that she/they is good in case we need to use they/them as a safe route in a scary place. But basically she was avoiding a lot of stuff 2 years ago and she‚Äôs a woman no questions about that. On HRT for 8 months now, the whole thing. It wasn‚Äôt that shocking to me either hahaha 

So my personal gender thing now is that I think a lot of my identity around her may have been tied to the fact that I was actually experiencing some comp het stuff and don‚Äôt like men really much at all. Makes sense because I didn‚Äôt marry a man lol. It‚Äôs complicated but I really feel comfortable with my femme side and identity as a woman around her. I‚Äôm definitely in the camp that we‚Äôre in a lesbian relationship either way since we‚Äôre two non-men. I just feel like empowered as a queer person and as a woman if that‚Äôs not cringe??? And I‚Äôve always been okay with labels like wife, mom, sister, daughter, etc. But I don‚Äôt like being labeled as a woman at work or around some friends who don‚Äôt really get why that feels right or wrong to me.

I know that gender is complicated and no one has the answers and I literally can label myself however I feel and whatever is best for my internal situation. But I‚Äôm just curious how y‚Äôall feel about your relationship to your sexuality and how it affects your gender.

TLDR: my wife came out as trans like 8 mos ago and now idk if I‚Äôm actually nb or just a lesbian who was kinda mad at the world/queer community for being shitty to me?? I was just dealing with some internal shit and I realized I may have fucked up and married a man. I‚Äôm probably actually a lesbian but now it‚Äôs fine bc she‚Äôs a woman so it makes sense why I fell in love with her after all lol",vbl70m,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/vbl70m/complicated_labels_stuff_but_ill_keep_it/,"['Anyone who isn\'t 100% male and likes people in a  ""lesbian way"" can identify as a lesbian']"

546,Is Demifem the right term or is there a better term i can use?," So I have a complicated relationship with my gender, and it‚Äôs really hard to explain, so bare with me. I am 17, AMAB, and Gay. Now for all my life two things have been certain: I‚Äôve always liked ‚Äúfeminine things‚Äù and I‚Äôve always HATED my hair. Ever since I was about three or four years old, my dad (without getting too much into the trauma I have with my dad) has forced me to get a buzzcut and it's the only hairstyle I have had since. But the thing is, I‚Äôve always hated it, but whenever I bring up that to other people, while some do agree with me, most will be like ‚ÄúOh but I like it, it really suits you!‚Äù  

 I always wondered why I was the only one who seemed to hate it. In fact, I could barely look in the mirror without crying, even now I still can't. I just thought maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm practically bald and that makes me look ugly. But then once when I was talking about it with my brother, he kept making suggestions to me about short and masculine hairstyles that were just a tiny bit longer than my current hair, ones my dad might be okay with. But I hated them all, and they all had something in common. They were all too masculine for me. And that‚Äôs when I realized I have Gender Dysphoria, and it‚Äôs not just in my hair, I get it from my facial and body hair, as well from my skin not being soft enough.

   But I also always been ‚Äúgirly‚Äù. Most of my friends my entire life have been girls, I just always felt like I could relate to them more than I do to other guys, I‚Äôve been yelled at for crossing my legs ‚Äúlike a girl‚Äù, I played with my cousins‚Äô barbies when I was little, I‚Äôve been super artistic always loved art and theatre, and I‚Äôve liked pretty things, flowers, and even recently due to some of my female friends‚Äô influences, I‚Äôve gotten into makeup, like when my friend offered to put eyeliner on me, I LOVED IT. 

  Now at first this may seem like your typical trans story, however this is where it starts to get a little bit complicated. I still like some ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù things, like ever since my sophomore year I‚Äôve been taking weight training classes and liked them, and I know it my make me end up with a more masculine build, but that‚Äôs actually one of the few things I don‚Äôt develop dysphoria from. And I like most men, love video games, and spend most of my time playing them, (yes I‚Äôm aware female‚Äôs like them to, I‚Äôm simply stating this because they are associated with masculinity, even if they shouldn‚Äôt be). 

  I don‚Äôt identify as transgender, nor agender, nor a lot of labels people have suggested. Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled to identify with any label because it was such a specific gender feeling. I‚Äôve never cared about what pronouns people use for me, for practical purposes I just use He/Him since that‚Äôs my sex and how people perceive me, which I‚Äôm totally okay with, but I‚Äôm Definitely open to She/Her and They/Them as well, hell I‚Äôd even be okay with Neo Pronouns. I still identify as male, however, I still have gender dysphoria, and I still feel more connected to my feminine side.

   So after some self-discovery and some light research, I found demifem, and I‚Äôve really identified with it. I didn‚Äôt identify with Demigirl because to me that suggests identifying partially as a Female/Woman/ Girl etc. which again I‚Äôm still a boy, not a girl. So I like Demifem because I identify as partially feminine.

   But here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused the definitions I found basically say ‚Äú a non-binary gender that is partially feminine in nature‚Äù and then goes onto say ‚Äúa person who identifies a non-binary gender and a feminine gender, although the percentage does not have to be 50-50.‚Äù So what I‚Äôm wondering, is being non-binary a requirement? Because, like I said, I still somewhat identify as a male, but not entirely? I know there‚Äôs demiboy and Demimasc, but to me that suggests a relationship with your masculine, while for me it‚Äôs a relationship to my feminine side. I would just say, ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm just a really feminine man‚Äù but it‚Äôs the gender dysphoria that‚Äôs stopping me from saying that because it can get really bad at sometimes.  

 So my question is, can I still be a male and be Demifem? Is anyone here Demifem who can answer, and if I‚Äôm excluded from Demifem, is there a better label I can use?",vayett,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/vayett/is_demifem_the_right_term_or_is_there_a_better/,"[""Hi, I'm not familiar with the term demifem particularly, though it seems like it is reasonable for you.

I thought about having permanent alterations done in secret (like having my tubes tied, not any transition stuff). I've been told that I act more like a bro than most guys and I feel comfortable and happier being like that. However, I do have a loving boyfriend and I love him very dearly as his girlfriend. A lot changed when I met him, like I want to start a family with him etc, yet I'm still not happy with how I look at myself in general. 

Lately, I've been thinking of portraying more masculine with my physical look and my hair mainly. I felt really weak being a female and I feel so much hatred being one at times. Idk if this is even possible but I guess I want to portray as different genders to certain people? But mainly I want to be more masculine as a person towards everyone else but feminine towards my partner and my family (as they would never understand this whole gender stuff).

I don't care about labels but I still want to know what I am without messing up any terms if anyone ever asks me on the future.

I'm a seasoned bisexual and have been in the queer community for a long time and have only recently realised I might not be a ""woman"". This sounds stupid even typing it out because I still like my body and don't have dysphoria about how I look (and worked my ass off to beat orthorexia and am proud of how I look). 

I am feminine presenting, I have dabbled in masc presentation before but it didn't feel right to me. I like girly things, I'm a pole dancer, I like makeup and fashion etc. A lot of my wardrobe and makeup is inspired by drag and I relate to the idea of gender as a joke, a performance for every day rather than a reality. 

My aesthetic is very curated but I see makeup and dressing up as art forms, I like turning myself into a moving art piece rather than ""I dress like x so people will see me as y"" if that makes sense. 

Most of my friends who know me well would describe me as a ""masculine female"" though, I'm not very girly in terms of personality if that makes sense. Idk how to phrase this I'm sorry. 

But every time someone refers to me as a woman I just feel unwell. I'm okay with being called a girl but I get the ick with female and woman. I hate hate hate it but I don't even have a reason so it makes me feel stupid. 

I talked to my therapist about it recently and she couldn't really give me any straight answers. She told me that more people aren't identifying with their birth sex because of endocrine disruptors in plastic, from pollution etc and gave me exercises to remove my negative connotations about the word ""woman"".

I felt quite hurt and I haven't addressed it because I have been seeing her for so long and have a lot of trust and she is a bit older so might not understand.  And it's been over a month since so maybe I should just let it go. 

I did say I was questioning my gender, but she didn't really give me any clear answers which I guess isn't her job but I left the session with more questions than I entered with. I don't know how to broach that with her.

As an aside I have realised I like using both she and they pronouns, but I haven't really come out to anyone about it, not even my partner of 2 years (whom I live with) because I don't even know how to explain it. 

Everyone I talk to makes me think I'm cis and there's just something wrong with my ideas, and idk maybe that is the case I just don't know how to move forward with these feelings safely. Its all so confusing.

552,"highly confused, very tired","Hey! I‚Äôm completely new to reddit, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm even doing this ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù. Hopefully, this is an okay place to vent.

So, for context, I come from a politically mixed family. My mother is pretty liberal, but my father is deeply republican. I‚Äôll talk more about this in a minute.

Also for context, I‚Äôve identified as a cisgender female my entire life‚Äîuntil now. Or, rather, until quarantine in 2020.

When quarantine began, I was just finishing my senior year of high school. At the start, I still identified as straight and cisgender. My abusive, four-year-long relationship had just ended (yay!). Right after graduation, I decided to take a gap year‚ÄîI spent that year in my parents‚Äô house, trying to process everything that happened in high school. My father was mostly out of the picture, so it was the first time since middle school that I could fully focus on myself.

During that time, I realized that I wasn‚Äôt cisgender. There was a span of a few days where I simply felt like a guy, thoroughly and without question. It was new to me, but the feeling didn‚Äôt last. Mostly, I just felt‚Ä¶ not completely cis. 

Eventually, I began going by she/they pronouns. I chose not to label my gender identity. When autumn came around again, I went to college with a fair certainty that I was genderfluid, although I preferred not to label it, since it was a new feeling.
Honestly, I thought my self-discovery journey thing was over. My focus went to academics and friends and some more complicated matters. But recently, I feel like my gender identity is changing again.
Since spring, I‚Äôve begun liking male pronouns. It began as me being fine with she/they, but also being comfortable with male pronouns. 

Over the last few months, though, even that has changed.

Now, I feel deeply uncomfortable with female pronouns. I go by he/they, but I‚Äôd be fine if people never referred to me by they/them pronouns again.
Ironically enough, I‚Äôve been on a family vacation for the past month. So, although I have the (secret) support of my mother and sister, I am also trapped with my highly republican father. Who doesn‚Äôt know about any of this. For the sake of my sanity, I don‚Äôt know if he should know, but that‚Äôs another matter altogether.

But, like I mentioned, my father‚Äôs political standing matters. Because now, I‚Äôm becoming curious about taking testosterone. Although I don‚Äôt want/need everything it offers, there are a lot of benefits I would love to have. Except‚Ä¶ my father would make my life a living hell if he knew about any of this.
And yes, I‚Äôm in college now. So, on paper, it seems like I can say ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô and do whatever I want. But my parents are financially supporting my entire education, which is a huge privilege. A privilege I would very much like to keep. A privilege I may not be able to keep if I come out to my father.

So, at least for now, I cannot take testosterone. And male pronouns are reserved for moments alone with my mother and sister, or for texts with my friends.
And anyway, testosterone isn‚Äôt a certainty for me yet. My gender identity has evolved so much since 2020. It‚Äôs continuously changed. Therefore, I don‚Äôt know if I can decide on hormone therapy right now, even if it might help.

Right now, though, that‚Äôs not even the main issue. My biggest point of conflict is just‚Ä¶ everything else. 
Everything feels super confusing. Having my identity continuously evolve over the last two years does not help. Like. How can I label my gender if it hasn‚Äôt stayed still? Can I call myself genderfluid if I‚Äôve felt like a man for 3 weeks straight? Is this something else entirely? Will I ever settle into my gender? So many questions.

Plus, to go from feeling confidently cisgender to this (whatever ‚Äúthis‚Äù even is) in a matter of two years was a big jump. I didn‚Äôt have any big gender revelations as a kid. The only time I can recall questioning it was in elementary school, when I sat in the car with my mother and nearly cried because my voice was ‚Äútoo girly‚Äù. Or in high school, when I told my then-boyfriend that I preferred being referred to with masculine-coded language (like calling me a king rather than a queen). Other than that? Nothing.

So, I don‚Äôt know where this gender questioning came from. Obviously, it began during quarantine, when we all had a little more time to know ourselves. But, if I wasn‚Äôt questioning my gender earlier, why then? Why now? Why didn‚Äôt I question it as a kid? It makes no sense to me.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm a guy. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a girl. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm something in between.

I don‚Äôt know what to call this. Although being unlabeled felt fine two years ago, I would love to have some clarity on it at this point. I would like to look more masculine. But I also like wearing feminine clothing sometimes. If I take testosterone and am perceived as a man? Amazing. The idea feels great. But to imagine being read as a man while wearing a dress in public transport feels scary. Plus, I still exclusively like men. Which opens up even more social stigma.

So, there are a lot of factors at play here. Things feel complicated and massively confusing. It‚Äôs scary. And exhausting. I wish I could wake up and know exactly who I am, and look like it, too. Unfortunately, I have a feeling that this will be a long process. I just hope it‚Äôll get easier eventually.

Thank you for reading this, if you‚Äôve made it this far. If you relate to this (or have any advice/personal experience to share), I would appreciate it so so much. 

I just hope everything makes sense eventually. For right now, though, it‚Äôs hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

People with penises? Something else?

There may be some women he's not attracted to, or some men that he is, but that doesn't negate his identity as a straight man because he's *generally* interested in women. It's not an exhaustive specification. It's also possible to use different words in different contexts. I might use nblw, or lesbian, or trixic or some other label, depending on whom I'm speaking with. By default, if I'm talking to a cis man, I'd probably reach for lesbian since that's something they're likely familiar with. In my non-binary support group, I use trixic, because they understand that term.\n\nBottom line, everyone has a unique experience of attraction, and each individual gets to pick the words they use to try to describe it. There aren't any wrong answers. There are no label police. Genderqueer people, and those who love us, can use any words they feel are accurate when describing their own attraction."", ""This is precisely why I think we need better terminology for sexuality that doesn't depend on anyone's gender."", 'well, he can be straight, and the two of you can still be in a queer relationship. but only he can define his own sexuality.', ""It sounds like you have the right idea, but your partner is a bit hung up. \n\nDon't get too hung up on the terminology.

Still def worth having the conversation. \n\nMy friends and I like to joke that the way a genderfluid person gets in a hetero relationship is if they date an agender person; labels are what you make of them', 'I\'d say yes - the prefix ""hetero"" meaning different or other. You\'re a different gender to him, so I think it\'s more or less as simple as that?', ""Technically, hetero means 'different'.

557,Straight male but am I genderqueer?,"I am a male in early 30s, and exclusively attracted and have been in relationship with straight cis women. I have been wondering about my gender/sexuality past couple years.

Growing up I've done a lot of sports and I was very athletic enough to be the captain of varsity team captain too. I have never hated my own body (built masculine body) but I was mentally confused if I want to be female. Not as a straight men's joke but I envied lesbian couples and I wished (still maybe..) I was born as a lesbian girl. I have thought about if I really feel confused and badly want to change my sex but I don't think I do. I like doing things that are still considered ""girly or feminine"", like to express my emotions, and of course I do like to wear women's clothes. Since I was adolescent I was always interested in women's clothes, I am always jealous of how women have more choices and styles to choose and express. I am not comfortable with terms like crossdresser, sissy, sub... because degrading or submissive (femdom, cuckhold) is not my thing (if it is for anyone, I don't judge at all) but I do like to bring some feminine outfit into bed once in awhile.

I think I always have masculinity but also femininity which is more than average straight guys. I feel like not only I don't like toxic masculinity/patriarchy but it feels... comfortable and relax to be able to be vulnerable and fragile too. I have always been in relationship that I had to act like protective and initiative type. I think I want to feel like ""loved"", ""given"", ""protected"", ""taken care of""... and feel exhausted being ""tough"".

Also, I think periodically once in every three or four months, I feel extremely a lot more feminine and want to be feminine than usual. I've never felt bi-curious, I've always dated straight women (not even bi or bi-curious) in my life.

560,"My partner has come out to me today as ""not cisgender"" and gender non conforming, how do I best support her moving forward?","Hi! I'm looking for advice, but please tell me if this is the wrong subreddit. 

I (24f bi) have been with my partner for over 3 years. In conversations we've had in the past six months, she had expressed she doesn't really understand the feeling of connection to a gender, in the past week she made comments about feeling really good about appearing less gender conforming in some pictures. And finally today she told me that she has been trying to make her way through murky feelings about her gender, and while she doesn't know exactly what it all means, the only clear conclusion is that she isn't cisgender.

This isn't coming out of left field for me because of past comments she has made, but it still feels like pretty big news to me. It seemed that she didn't want to make it into a big deal, so I told her that 1) I love her, always, and her gender doesn't play a role in how I feel about her 2) I will support her in whichever way she wants moving forward, and she's welcome to tell me if there's language that feels more or less comfortable for her 3) I'm always there if she wants to talk about it, but she doesn't have to of course. She really appreciated my answer, and were all good. 

But I'm wondering, how can I be the best partner possible for her moving forward? Do I open the conversations about pronouns, or do I let her come back to keep when she wants? Do you think I should get mentally ready for a potential transition? 

At  the end of the day, I love her so much, and I just want to be the best partner for her, because she makes me so happy.",v51a90,118,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/v51a90/my_partner_has_come_out_to_me_today_as_not/,"[""It sounds like you did a really nice job responding to your partner.

If you could literally just have a dick and breasts that you can easily take on and off (that aren\'t y\'know latex facsimiles), without it being a permanent decision to keep or remove, that would be a amazing. More than all of that, I wish we had more bodily autonomy. Intellectually, I get why trans people have to go to therapy and the like as part of transitioning, but emotionally it feels hideously condescending to have these gender affirming things like hormones and cosmetic surgury gatekept until we sufficiently prove that we\'re definitely what we say we are. I understand that there\'s a possibility for someone to decide that hormones just aren\'t for them or regretting an ""irreversible"" surgery, but just the same...cis people don\'t have to get months or years of therapy before getting cosmetic surgery or therapeutic hormones for whatever reason they might need/want it?

So claiming to be male or even transitioning, I knew that'd be too much for me. But I was so indecisive because I wanted to get it, I wanted to understand what I was. I wanted to be just one thing. And I technically am, but I'm not.

So I've learned that I'm genderqueer.

So it was with that I understood I had a lot going on. I'm a mesh, and I'm okay with that. I love my boobs, but I don't need the ""princess treatment"" all the time just because of them.

I can say I'm very comfortable identifying as genderqueer. And sadly, that's the only thing in my life I'm comfortable with lmao My orientation is still another matter.

576,How to know if I correspond with my AGAB ?,"Hi to everyone,

Recently I'm trying to fully understand the definition of ""trans"" because I'm pretty sure 85% I'm a trans girl (AMAB) or at least a non-binary (demigirl). But after all my hopes of non being seeing as a ""man"" [linked with its social roles] I'm sure I'm not cis.

But I don't know, basing on genderdysphoria.fyi's definition of transgender with ""Denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their sex assigned at birth"", if I don't correspond with my sex assigned at birth.

How do I know if I correspond with my AGAB? Via dysphoria?
If so I hate my hairy body, but liking/doesn't really mind my voice, wish I could try to have some breast because since a week when I cross dressed with some bras I felt an inner peace and euphoria [and dysphoria with the tiny chest hair]. And I am growing my hair. Also I am envious of women body and their appearances.

From what I learnt I can be a woman if I identify as one but I am little scared of it because I don't know if I'll be able to be woman.
I'm pretty sure I don't want to raise like a man; and at the same time I desire to be a girl [it excite me enough the idea of being a wonderful girl] and being considered like one. In fact I think I have social dysphoria when people [ :') I hate people ] refer me with male pronouns, because of this I love and use in my mind ""she/her"" pronouns {in my native language, Italian, we unfortunately don't have the possibility to express gender neutrality like the ""I am"", very sad}

So how can I understand if I correspond with my AGAB?

577,"Classic ""am I trans ?""","Hi to everyone,

Since a month (after I finally become aware of the terms and their meanings of ""trans"", ""non binary"", etc) I'm questioning obsessively, reading and researching every day online and borrowing physical books, if I am a trans woman/girl (AMAB).

I am aware that the only person who can know it is me and eventually my therapist (actually I don't have one and planning it for a probable HRT process); but I still ask you.

Answering to the ""Button quiz"" (if, by pressing it, I'll turn with a woman body and fully accepted) I'll say yes because I want to try being a woman viewing if it can identify with the image I have of myself. In fact lately, after learning the meaning of dysphoria, I feel disappointed comparing my actual face on the mirror and the ideal version (that I don't know but definitely it isn't masculine). I hate wide thighs, muscles, belly, hair, ambiguous voice and the structure of my face

I shaved for trying that sensation and I love it [I really don't know how I could live until know with a hairy body].
I hate when people refer me with ""he/him/sir"" pronouns because it give me the sense of being strictly put in a stereotypical field, and using ""she/her"" give me euphoria (also when 2 of my friends refer me with feminine pronouns after I asked them) and a little sense of strangeness because I suppose is all new for me. For my language is more complicated, in fact in Italian is literally impossible to translate ""I'm tired"" giving the initial sense of gender neutrality, it'll be translated with ""Io sono stanca"" for 'female' or ""Io sono stanco"" for 'male'.

If you would ask me *why I want to be a woman* I'll answer in 2 parts. 1¬∞ I don't know, 2¬∞ I perceive women to be freer by their wonderful dresses, public emotions and their beauty.
Linked with it, always when I seen a woman (doesn't matter if 169% super model or not) I am envious and jealous mentally saying ""damn it, I wish I could be like you"" or ""oh, you don't know how much like you are being a woman"".
Recently, after some advice from forum, I cross dressed with high heels, skirt, bra and dresses; and OMG I felt sooo cute [ erection included ;) ]. I'm not sure but the bra (too bulky for me by my mum) gave me a sense of completeness like for a pirate to find a treasure.
I decided to grow my hair for viewing how I feel.
I did a tons of online quiz (I know that it is not a relevant clinical help) and when I had the trans woman/demigirl I was in peace. At the other face of the coin when I scored ""non trans"" I felt disappointed like an imposter and losing so much hopes and mental energy for a delusion.

I am sure I don't want to be a man (the toxic version) and, for now, I don't desire a bottom surgery ( too pain and I like my penis; meanwhile the top surgery feels interesting.

579,How the fuck do people figure out their gender??,"I'm AFAB and having a goddamn crisis. Here's a rough timeline of events:

I had zero doubt in my gender identity until two or so years ago when I started thinking I was nonbinary. Then I decided I still identified as female. I also went through a period of wanting to be male when I was younger, but I later realized it stemmed from internalized misogyny. 

Currently, I don't know what to say if someone asks what I identify as. I tell people I use she/they, but if someone called me a ""he"" it wouldn't bother me, even if it doesn't feel as ""correct"" as the other two. I look at pictures of nonbinary people and think ""I wish I could pull that off,"" and I don't feel strongly attached to a female identity, but actually identifying as nonbinary doesn't feel right. I feel like I'm ""too cis"" for it, because I'm not masculine at all, I'm a little (but not very) feminine, and I don't have body dysphoria (except for having long hair, which makes me weirdly uncomfortable).

How the hell do people figure out their own gender? Normally I don't particularly care about labels, but every once in a while it'll pop up (like now) and occupy all my brain space, and not having an answer is driving me nuts.

580,question re: safety vs comfort,"I (cisfem) have a child (amab) who identifies as non binary. I support them and encourage them to live as their most authentic self. They use plural neutral pronouns but are mostly male presenting.

Now, because they are so young (9), and because the world is terrible sometimes, i still use male pronouns when talking to their teachers, doctor, and other adults in their life who's opinions i don't know. I do this to hopefully spare them from being treated differently, or worse getting hurt by someone who they trust. I know it frustrates my kid, but imo safety needs to come before comfort, and I've encouraged them to always start with their birth pronouns and not tell people they are nb until they feel comfortable and safe doing so. 

I don't want them to not be themselves, but i also don't want anything bad to happen as a result of them being themselves.

If your kid wants to use the pronouns they are comfortable with publicly they are likely aware of the risks (and good on you for bringing it up), but you should be willing to go to bat for them should anything go wrong. Forsaking the comfort of your child for the comfort of others doesn't seem the appropriate route here."", ""Thanks everyone for your perspectives. This is new for both of us and my intent was to learn and do better. My kid is the only non-cis person i personally know, so I don't have any other sounding boards to ask these questions. \n\nI do want to clarify though that I never misgender them at home, or with people we trust, and I'm not out here blindly misgendering them. When we discussed pronouns this is a concern I presented and asked about and they were initially ok with still being he/him to certain people, but as time has gone on i could see it was getting more frustrating for them. This is why I wanted to ask people who know more about gender identity, because I've never been in their shoes. \n\nI also want to add that I would absolutely throw down if someone mistreated or disrespected my kid for any reason, not just gender related reasons, and they do know that, as I have gone to bat and advocated for them in other situations where they were being bullied (albeit for different reasons). My intent wasn't to show them i don't support them but rather to never have them be in a position of having to defend themselves, at least until they're older and more capable of doing that. I do feel it's my job to protect them, but I guess I didn't realize how much my own fear of them being hurt could actually be hurting them.\n\nAfter reading and reflecting I talked to my kid to check in on how they felt about it and discussed some of the points you all made here. They said they understand why I am worried and they're more frustrated at others maybe not understanding than me calling them he/him. I asked what they want to do in the future and they said they want me to tell everyone they are nb (really they said blast out out of a loudspeaker to the whole earth). I asked if they were scared and how they felt and what they would do if they were mistreated and i wasn't there. They said they were a little scared because they have lost a couple of friends they told, but so far no one they've told has bullied them really. They say they feel best being they them and if someone picks on them they will tell me or whatever trusted adult is around, and that they feel confident that i would handle the problem.\n\nSo, all things considered, they will no longer be him to anyone."", ""External harm is shit, but it can be 'rationalized' Oh, they're a bigot, oh they don't understand. \n\nInternal harm is worse. Mom says she respects me but does she really? Does she think this is a phase? Maybe I AM making it up. This is causing way more real harm then any potential harm from the outside.\n\nYour intentions may be good, wanting to protect them. But you aren't showing up for them, you are showing them it's 'shameful' and something they have to hide from others. \n\n Be an example to other adults in your childs life. Be unflinching in your support."", ""What about their mental safety? You are purposefully misgendering them, knowing it is hurting and upsetting them, against their wishes. Children with accepting and supporting parents have FAR lower rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. \n\nIf your child *wanted* this protection, that would be one thing, but it doesn't sound like they do. I know! It's scary! But you're a momma bear, right? Channel those instincts to stand up for your child rather tham teaching your child that their identity is something to be ashamed of and to hide. Be so ferociously proud of your child that your drown out those who would do them harm.\n\nInstead of encouraging them to hide and fear, help them communicate with others. Teach them to stand up for themself (in appropriate ways). Talk to them about coping with people who hurt or upset them because everybody runs into people that hurt or upset them, regardless of if you're cis or trans."", 'It is going to be much easier and safer for you to advocate for them then for them to advocate for themself. I wish my mother would. It‚Äôs actually more damaging to hear my mother using the wrong pronouns around other people or introducing me incorrectly than when she misgenders me at home. It makes me feel powerless to the older adults. And I‚Äôm fucking 30 years old. Unless you‚Äôre in a state that criminalizes parents who support their trans children, I would support your child and not misgender them in front of other adults', 'I know it‚Äôs not easy to see your child go through pain, but telling them to lie to the world and hide who they are is not going to help them. I have a 10yo who is figuring herself out and is questioning her gender. She is visibly different then the rest of her classmates by her own choice and I‚Äôve told her that this will raise questions and possibly bullying, but no matter what I will be there for her to talk, listen, and if need be tear strips out of others to allow her to be herself. She is positively reinforced at home where she is safe no matter what, and she does not like her parents to fight her battles for her (but she also knows at the drop of a hat we‚Äôll be there). Having that feeling of safety behind her allows her to weather the inevitable bigotry that she encounters and learn to stand up for herself with confidence. \n\nWhen our kids grow up they are not entering a different world. It‚Äôs the same one, except that as an adult you now must fight those battles alone at times and it‚Äôs dangerous. If they don‚Äôt learn now how to live as themselves they‚Äôre going to scramble to catch up without a safety net. \n\nI apologize if this came off as a lecture, I‚Äôm just passionate about this topic. You do seem to genuinely love and care for your child and want what‚Äôs best for them and I admire that. All I‚Äôm really trying to say is that I understand the pain of being a parent and watching them hurt is more painful then being hurt yourself. That‚Äôs the responsibility we accepted. I believe that teaching them to be themselves and confident, including healthy coping mechanisms to deal with pain is paramount.', 'i think you‚Äôre trying to protect your child from harm that doesn‚Äôt exist yet. you‚Äôre saying safety comes before comfort, but who says there will be any issues? i think there will be a lot of times where people are accepting and then your kid is comfortable and there‚Äôs no harm done. but by ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù them, you‚Äôre actually the one causing the harm. do you want it to be you or other people?', ""While I completely agree with most of the other comments and am glad you've taken the advice to heart, I just wanted to clarify something in the initial post- you said your kid uses plural pronouns but then use they/them?

That can be more detrimental to mental and social health than the occasional misgender or slur from a stranger/less close acquaintance. From a parent or mentor it will carry more weight.\n\nThere will always be people that misunderstand or hate us.

582,Recent Revelations and Acceptance,"tl/dr:  I, a straight cis male, recently confronted my femininity that I've hid for decades.

I found this sub and while I've come to finally accept myself, it's been a process and there haven't bee a lot of places I can openly discuss it, even on Reddit.  So, I kinda just wanted to tell my story.  Long, so TL/DR at the top.  I remember when I was little, I had tendencies towards both, and always being told ""boys don't do that"".  I didn't have an effeminate way of speaking, yet there were always a number of kids that would call me gay or the ""F-slur"".  I didn't let too much bother me, mostly because I've always just preferred doing my own thing, and happy to just be a misfit.

It was probably about 7th grade when I really became conscious of occasionally feeling like I was sometimes a girl and sometimes a boy.  Like the occasional dream where I was building something with Legos while wearing a dress and literally the opposite sex followed by a dream where I was regular old me.  We had a pool, and someone left a bikini at the house a few years back, and so knowing no one was coming for it, I grabbed it, went to the bathroom, locked the door (my parents wouldn't put locks on our doors so they could just invade whenever they felt like it because fuck our privacy) and I tried it on.  It was weird because I stupidly for once felt ""pretty"".  No one gave me a compliment, I refused to look at myself in a mirror, I just felt ""cute"" and ""pretty"".  Being that I liked girls, I became sooo conflicted, I then thought, ""WTF is wrong with me?!""  My parents were pretty homophobic and generally really not anyone I could ever go to about anything, let alone this.  So for a while, I did this in private, until I became so conflicted that I just crushed it down and put it away from who I was which has the later impact of making someone bitter.  Granted I did find a bunch of other misfits in the hardcore/punk scene, I was still uncomfortable enough about myself that it was buried.

Recently (this past October actually), my oldest said to me and my wife (her step mom) that they didn't feel like they were completely a \[assigned gender\], and they felt like they were more of a \[opposite gender\].  They felt more romantically attracted to \[assigned gender\].  Of course we gave them the worlds biggest hug and said ""That's great that you're talking about this!  I know it was hard, but love you whoever you are!""  I even told them that I basically knew or at least had inklings about it a few years ago simply because I pay attention to their behaviors, tastes, actions, etc.

Which brings me here.  After that discussion, I started thinking about my own young adolescence as it was about the age I started having those thoughts and feelings.  So I started searching for information, or basically anything I could find just on the psychology of it because of the conflict I grew up with.  During my last quarantine, I decided after several sleepless nights, to just try dressing in a hidden way.  It felt good, and I wanted to try more, so I recently escalated.  That felt good.  I accept I have a definite feminine side.  I no longer feel gross or wrong for it.  I had a discussion about my deeper things with my wife and it went well.  Granted we had to be a bit ‚Äúunder the influence‚Äù but we‚Äôre waaayyy of age so it‚Äôs aight.  It‚Äôs like a ton is off my shoulders and she‚Äôs good and wants to know more.

but like... i dont know. i know that labels arent neccesary and not everyone wants them, but im someone who really likes labels you know? the issue is that i definitely prefer they/them over she/her, and barely anyone ever calls me by he/him pronouns. and recently some of my friends HAVE been calling me by he/him pronouns more often and i actually kind of really like it? all this being said, i do still like being called by she/her pronouns every once in a while and i want to be referred to by feminine terms (girlfriend, queen, etc.).

""Guy gender"" for me is 100% associated with my personality. And my body is a part of my personality, I don't want to change it.
 
""Girl gender"" for me is like ""impersonal experiences"". For example, I may want  to *hug someone as a girl* (not a femboy), but I don't feel in this moment that I  could really be a girl, fully and consistently. Not a single time I experienced  a ""girl version"" of my personality.

601,Gender identity and segregation,"Recently I got into an argument with a cisgender man about gender identity. The context being a school offering its students other options to choose from besides male/female when it comes to gender. He argued that this was completely unnecessary and that anybody who supports this initiative (me included) is just contributing to segregating and persecuting people. I argued back that persecution happens regardless of people labeling themselves as binary or nonbinary, and I asked if by dropping the label wasn't he suggesting that people should stop expressing themselves and just... disappear? At this point he stopped engaging. 

I'm making this post, because I don't care much about my gender identity, so I feel like I'm not really able to get the whole picture and I'm fairly limited in my understanding on how it is for people who do. I am going to put here some of my thoughts on the topic and it would be extremely helpful if you can jump in and bring some clarifications.

I've seen various arguments on this topic. First: Why do people need to overanalyze themselves and label, label, label? What I fail to understand is why is there a concern about categories when it comes to gender identity and not everything else? I mean, why is it ok to label ourselves based on our religion, nationality, job, social status, based on our interests in music, literature, sports and so on, but the line is drawn when it comes to gender? Is there a difference between all the other identities and gender identity and I'm failing to see it? 

And second I've seen the argument that there is not a physical, visible or legal difference between different gender identities (besides m/f), so then they're not relevant or necessary.  Here I would say that neither a name is relevant or necessary, since you can use your social security number to identify in a sistem, and that works even better than a name, since there's no two identical social security numbers, but there are plenty of identical names. So, one can argue that name is somebody's preference, as pronouns are, right? Since people are allowed to change their names to ones they like more, why is it such a big deal with choosing pronouns?

As those categories do not generate new labels at even close to the same speed, and never have (partially because we didn‚Äôt have the internet to connect everyone back when society was deciding their terms).\n\nFor the first issue you brought up, it is mostly something that will be solved with time, as language in the common lexicon slowly evolves to properly encompass the conversation. I know many people want to force language to catch up faster, but that just won‚Äôt work... people hate change.\n\n\nOnto the 2nd topic, I honestly think this is just a result of topic 1. Because language hasn‚Äôt reached where it needs to be to properly have these conversations, even within the non-binary communities, you have massive differences in answers to the question of what an individual of any given non-binary label looks or acts like. \n\nSociety as a whole will never accept that, because labels are meant as shortcuts to understanding something. And because they don‚Äôt understand it, they cognitively have a hard time remembering to use the right pronouns. Generally it isn‚Äôt malice, it is a communicative incompatibility.\n\n\nTL;DR: WE don‚Äôt even agree on all the terms we should be using for these things, and as such the rest of society (who isn‚Äôt actively participating in our conversations on gender) cannot understand what is going on. It isn‚Äôt that they don‚Äôt want to, it is that they cognitively cannot. This is, at least in my opinion, the root of why non-binary folk are not accepted by society.', 'I got such a rant on labels in general and how they facilitate discrimination and prejudice just itching to come out....and like no time to do it justice.', 'If people who think labels are unnecessary only want to get rid of trans and nonbinary labels then they\'re just transphobic and want us gone. my answer to cis people who want to criticize gender labels and say we don\'t need them is always ""you get rid of yours first, and then i\'ll get rid of mine"".']"
602,Can't bind - any (comfortable) alternatives?,"Hey. I'm AFAB, fat, with pretty big boobs. I've known I was non-binary for a couple of years, but cause I was trying really hard to accept my body (cause of internalised fatphobia!) I deliberately didn't really think much about how I might want my body to look to affirm my gender feelings.

But now the cat is out of the bag (so to speak) and I've started having feelings about my chest - that I'd like it to be flatter, or at least less ""in the way"". I think at some point I might like top surgery, but that's going to be way in the future as I'm going to have to save up for ages to pay for both the surgery and a psych referral (I'm in the UK). 

I ordered a binder and it was absolute hell. I have a sensory processing disorder and the physical discomfort was really hard to bear. I absolutely need to be comfortable to be able to function. I also hate hate hate wearing regular femme bras, because they are pretty uncomfortable & are starting to feel really dysphoric. My ideal thing is just not wearing a bra, because then I don't have to think about them - but it's getting towards summer and I can't really do that all the time now cause of, well, >!sweaty underboob.!<

606,uncomfy with my binary pronouns (and more,"hello, everyone... i'm a 19yo afab, and have been identifying as enby for a few months now. generally my pronouns go by she/he, but for a while i've been flowing amongst the masculine spectrum/side (?) of it all, and it is what is most comfortable for me right now. however, i'm not outed as non-binary for anyone except my girlfriend (who is cis) and one of my friends, and as such, most people always use she/her to direct themselves to me. again, this was fine by me and i had never felt uncomfortable with being treated in the feminine, but right now this is taking a turn and i suspect it has something to do with gender dysphoria? it is not like i don't like my body the way it was conceived (a female body with feminine characteristics), but at the same time... i wonder if somehow my growing identification with masculinity (not only related to masculine pronouns, but also mannerisms and just masculinity as it is) is clashing with my bodily conception & view? 

so yeah, i don't know if i made myself very clear with all of this, but i just am searching for some kind of advice in how to deal with potential gender dysphoria, considering that i'm not indeed umcomfy with my body, but rather confused as to how to perceive myself as a man and not having a masculine structured body :(",upkhxr,12,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/upkhxr/uncomfy_with_my_binary_pronouns_and_more/,"[""hi, I'm in a really similar situation. just switched to they/them pronouns with a trusted few.

As far as other people's perceptions go, I wore them out and got a lot of compliments. biggest one being they suited my vibe, and since I felt that their vibe was more masculine, hearing that it matched mine was pretty euphoric. \n\nmaybe start with something similar, a piece of clothing or an activity that feels a little ambiguous and gives you freedom to step between masculine and feminine just to explore what parts of your masculine side you really love expressing. \n\nI hope sharing my own experience helps a little bit! my partner also has been using he/they a lot more with me and while it doesn't quite feel right all the time, it feels good. maybe your partner can help with that too :)""]"

I started conforming less to my gender identity and while I still dress fairly femininely, my clothing choices are generally androgynous leaning to the feminine side, especially during wintertime (flannels, running shoes, tanktops, etc). I don't think that my overall gender expression (altho I sometimes consider myself to be a tomboy) is either feminine or masculine specifically, just wtv feels comfortable. Still, I always identified as a cis-girl and my pronouns were generally she/her.

However, all that was thrown into question yesterday. We had a group art activity yesterday, and we finished early, so we decided to use the time to just chat about stuff. One of our group members was an enby, and at one point of our converstation, they asked us what our pronouns were. I answered like I always did. She/her.

I was always okay with ppl referring to me by binary pronouns, and I was okay typing it, but i didnt like hearing myself say it outloud for some reason??? idek?

I began pondering that thought when I got home from school. I began to wonder if I had any other ""disconnect"" from my identity. I wouldn't necessarily call it gender dysphoria since I feel comfortable being called a girl, using she/her pronouns, and my female body. But idk.

I recently joined her dance studio and was having the best time ever.

Things changed for me after our group was discussing costumes for our performance, and my choreographer only provided options for a ‚Äúladies‚Äù costume and a ‚Äúguys‚Äù costume, excluding a non-binary option for people like me. On top of that, she seemed to resist me making a boundary that I wasn‚Äôt going to wear something that made me uncomfortable in multiple ways including not having enough support for my large chest while hip hop dancing. 

Now this circle of people doesn‚Äôt feel like a safe space for me. I just want a space where I feel like all of my identities are respected and celebrated all at once. Is that possible? Has anyone in here had that?

I am AMAB, I have been picked on from a young age for appearing quite genderfluid. I am now identifying openly as queer as opposed to gay, this tiny step has had a huge benefit, more steps might come but I am just trying to take my journey of figuring myself out slowly. Trying to question why I react so badly to misgendering or remarks on the mean side of life is something that I have really done a lot of work on throughout my adult life (now 33). I really wish that I didn't react so badly as I really love and admire all genderqueer people I meet. I recently ended a relationship due to my ex's friends constantly joking or passing comments on my gender identity (the ex didn't have my back in the end). I ended up being some kind of inside joke, people were constantly trying to guess my gender or to get little jokes in. I am proud to be queer and different but I felt like the environment was stifling me or triggering bullying from years ago. I think I was right to have called out bad behaviour, a few years ago I would be too afraid to say anything out of shame or having to admit to my own gender-queerness. Self-doubt creeps in sometimes and tells me that I was just acting from a trauma trigger response and I shouldn't have reacted so badly.

617,Questioning my gender identity thanks to toxic masculinity,"Hi! Where to begin, hmmm. I've never embraces masculine stereotypes but my presentation is masculine.  I've found myself in conversations where I felt that if I were younger (I'm 42) and had been exposed to the concept of gender identity I'd probably identity as nonbinary or genderqueer. Several recent unpleasant interactions made me realize that internalized masculinity has been a detriment to my mental health.

One such encounter occurred at my work where I facilitated a group that just left me feeling icky (I work in mental health with the homeless). This particular group just had so much toxic masculinity show up. I left feeling exhausted and replaying tapes in my head where my perceived masculinity hurt me.

This all feels somewhat tangential, I'm still trying to process where I'm at. I was sitting with the thought of identifying with something that is more in line with how I see myself (as a person who likes and dislikes stuff and doesn't intentionally seek things out that are in line with gender) gave me a sense of peace. But then Monday happened and I got very anxious thinking about change and feeling judged.

Not sure what I'm looking for, I think I just needed to get this out.",um3guq,57,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/um3guq/questioning_my_gender_identity_thanks_to_toxic/,"['I think I completely understand you, I am also 42 and it feels like when we were younger none of the non binary and interesting options existed.

619,Why am I apathetic and tired of my identity?,"Prefacing that I love knowing I'm genderqueer and gnc. 

The problems kinda lay outside of that? So out of complete apathy, I don't bother explaining my gender and/or relation to it. Part of me just lays down and accepts that the ma'ams, ladies, girls, misses, etc. would happen even with correction so I don't waste my breath. I know that since I'm more on the femme side (always presented that way) that no matter what I do/say I'll be labeled as such even if I internally roll my eyes. I also use my dead name all the time since it's easier to explain based on credentials, work-life, and anytime I have to defend who I am in paperwork. I hate my dead name and being a rainbow baby but just resort to it out of apathy. 

I think it comes out in my pronouns too (not that they correlate to gender or define my gender). I use she/they but just list she/her as it's easier for cis people and don't care to put myself in an awkward position (if they notice) by using the right ones. The set isn't completely wrong, but it's not right either. I prefer being referred to as they/them and don't have the motivation right now to use they/she since I'd expect people to default to she anyways. 

When it comes to femininity, I'm increasingly uncomfortable too. I can't stop seeing those spaces as terf grounds/gnc exclusionary (see: labeling issues or topics as women's rights or girl power)/unaware of the danger they can cause or participate in. I know I'd just be a footnote if I wanted to be there if at all acknowledged, so my pushback would stay in my thoughts. I know that I'd have to carve out space when I don't want to justify my presence. Yet I keep getting pulled into them and I don't know why beyond appearance and assumption. 

With all of that push, it almost convinces me that I should just fall into the role and become numb to it to move more easily through everything. I've ranked what I'll begrudgingly take on (ie would never accept 'girl' but guess I could go with 'woman' if I had no other options). It comes down to wanting to be seen but not wanting to put in the effort to be seen as I am (which is contradictory and can't live in harmony).Truthfully I don't know the extent this affects me but if I sat down and took a hard look it would be overwhelming.

624,"We've expanded the 'Free Binder' list of links on our sidebar. If you're a minor who needs a binder, please check them out! Thank you!","Howdy, y'all. For years, we've kept a link to transactive.org's 'In A Bind' program on our sidebar, but unfortunately their website keeps changing as their organization changes webhosts. Sometimes, like right now, their website is down entirely, which also means that link on our sidebar doesn't actually go anywhere when their website is down.

As you can imagine, I'm sure this is very frustrating to people who came here, saw the link for free binders, and felt hopeful, only to find the link doesn't go anywhere anymore.

Well, to fix this problem, and since there are several more groups offering free binders these days, I've just added more links to our sidebar. Here's the new list:

Free binders for youth in need (21 or 24 and under):

626,"Wondering about the UN's ""Gender equality"" goal","Hiya all  üíú  
My partner made me aware today of one of the UN's sustainable development goals. This one is titled ""Gender equality and women's empowerment"" ([https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5)) Basically this goal is something that the UN aims to achieve by 2030, when they will most likely formulate a new set of goals for 2050 or something like that. I've seen on various subreddits the discussion around lumping women and genderqueer people into one group, but this is not about that.  
What this is about is the fact that a goal on Gender Equality does not even explicitly mention genderqueer people. I never want to downplay the struggles that women and girls face in this world and I can't pretend that these struggles are not big enough to deserve being formulated and worked towards under a dedicated goal. But at the same time I can't help but feel that one of the biggest international organizations formulating this under the umbrella of Gender Equality is missing something by including only a subset of us genderqueer folks.  


I personally wouldn't wanna change anything about how this stands now, but I hope genderqueer folks would be included as part of a Gender Equality goal in the future.

So my question to you all:  
\- what do you think about this in general? You think the UN should've included genderqueer people or would that only lead to downplaying women's and girl's struggles as a consequence? (this sounds very TERFy now that I see it written out, and to be clear that is not where I stand)  
\- do you know of any organizations that might be involved in including genderqueer people in the discussion of Gender Equality and Equity at an internation level?

My experience with gender and sexuality has always been a little messy and convoluted with me constantly questioning and struggling to feel comfortable. For a long time, I identified as FTM. My name was legally changed at this time, so I have a very traditionally masculine name.

I was on testosterone for about a year and a half at a low dose, then stopped doing my shots because I dreaded them every week and the changes they maintained weren't as important to me as the permanent ones. I am also a year post top surgery. These two things were absolutely crucial to me feeling enough like myself to be able to narrow down my identity. Which brings me to the issue...

WHY DO CIS PEOPLE ALWAYS ASSUME I'M DETRANSITIONING???

No. Are you a ""she"" now? NO. Are you changing your name back? Absolutely not my deadname is not vibey and I'm quite used to being called Matthew now.

Simply say something like ""I go by \\*insert pronouns here\\* now."" or ""I\'d appreciate it if you could refer to me by \\*insert pronouns here.\\*"" They aren\'t entitled to any information and you don\'t need to give them a reason if they ask why. I really hope this helps in any way :) Best of luck!!', ""**disclaimer: Not everyone will agree with me so save your arguments, this is an outline of how I define and use these terms, it's about how I understand my own identity and communicate with others. You do you, this is an example of how I break it down**\n\n\nFor me (they/them AFAB) I use different labels to convey different things. I basically break things down into different categories based on my understanding of the terms. \n\nThe way I look at it the main umbrella term is trans, as in 'not-cisgender.' So anyone who is not cis falls under the trans umbrella. \n\nTrans then I break into two categories, binary trans and nonbinary trans (or simply nonbinary for short). Either you're binary trans (a trans man or a trans woman) or nonbinary trans (literally anything else under the trans umbrella).\n\nGenderqueer feels like it could be used pretty much interchangeably with nonbinary, I take it as literally the queering of gender, so really it could be probably be even more of a catch-all term for anything that is outside the expected norms of gender. I love the term and often describe myself as genderqueer but it doesn't seem to be catching on in the larger community all that much, possibly due to the term 'queer' still being divisive in many communities. Nonbinary seems to be the most popular term so I often default to that for the sake of clarity and mutual understanding.\n\nNonbinary then has it's own sub categories such as agender, demigirl, demiboy, genderfluid, etc. \n\nOverall I'd say I'm agender because gender genuinely doesn't feel like anything in and of itself to me, it's simply a box that others try to put me in based on what they think my genitalia looks like and that's real weird to me. \n\nBut I also could on some level consider myself demigirl or librafeminine because I'm very aware that I still present pretty femme, and the fact that I've been told I'm a woman and been treated as a woman for the first few decades of my life has greatly impacted my opportunities and obstacles in life. I very much identify with other AFAB people of all genders in the shared oppression we faced growing up. Especially with the current political climate in the US the fact that I have a uterus that allegedly works is pretty damn relevant as well and I don't like to discount that or act like it isn't extremely relevant for my life.\n\nI might also fall under the label genderfluid because I do have tendencies to fluctuate between preferring more masc or more femme things, I usually call them 'boy mode' and 'girl mode' so for example I've been in boy mode for the past 6 months at least and the idea of presenting femme sounds exhausting and unappealing. Though idk if this is truly genderfluid because it feels more like fluctuating preferences than a shift in identity or gender so I don't usually use the term without qualifying and explaining more.\n\nSo based on context I might say I'm trans, might say I'm nonbinary, might say I'm agender, might say I'm genderqueer, I might list all of those. Labels don't exist to confine me to fit within their definitions, they are simply tools to communicate with others. So I use whatever labels fit my needs. I make the labels work for me rather than try to put myself into a box created by that label, because at that point it doesn't feel much different than trying to conform to my AGAB.\n\nI greatly prefer they/them pronouns, if I give people the option to use multiple or wherever pronouns they want I pretty much exclusively get she/her and I hate that. Also currently trying to work towards a more androgynous presentation but sticking with my theme of not letting others define me I try to remember it's ok to like what I like and present however I want, I'm still valid af.\n\nSo that's basically how I look at and use the terms. You don't need to pick one and only one to define yourself, and you don't need to let the label dictate your behavior or presentation. Use the labels however you want, but if you are using them in novel or unexpected ways you should be prepared to either clarify things or leave everyone very confused\n\nedited: formatting""]"

636,"first I thought I was cis, then alysgender, then genderfluid, then neutrois, now I'm probably genderfluid/demiboy????","I've had a very rocky relationship with my gender for the past 2 years and I felt like I could use this as a way to share my struggle (although I dont really see it as a struggle, more like a goofy zig-zagging journey of confusion that would make for a great sitcom) as well as maybe organize my thoughts about my gender better. 

For most of my life I've thought I was cis but never really questioned it since i was raised in a super conservative house and the idea of even questioning my gender was heavily stigmatized for me until very recently. 

Quick bit about me: I'm AFAB and use they/them 

When I first started questioning my gender I realized I hated being called she/her pronouns and being referred to as femme stuff. It just give me this disgusted gut reaction that feels so wrong. So at the very least I know I'm not cis. I only feel social dysphoria though and I feel pretty comfortable with my body as it is. 

For a while I thought I was alysgender, a form of gender fluidity where you fluctuate between masc, femme, and neutral gender feelings but feel comfortable with none of them. However later I realized I dont really know what gender *feels* like. I dont know what being femme or masc actually feels like so I thought I was quoigender or neutrois. 

I stuck with that for a while since I felt it described me best but yet again I've started to question my gender. 

So I'm autistic and have ADHD and I've had special interests my whole life. Recently I gained a special interest in the Kingsman movies, primarily the characters Harry Hart and Eggsy Unwin as well as their actors, Colin Firth and Taron Egerton. Both the characters and actors are cis men but they are known for challenging gender norms and being very open and friendly with the queer community. Taron is especially known for challenging gender norms since he played Elton John in the movie ""Rocketman"" and has been very close friends with Elton John irl. He is no stranger to wearing giant high heels, shiny 80s style skin tight suits with plenty of skin showing, and generally femme/androgynous styles. I admire him so much for shattering masc gender norms and being completely comfortable with his sexuality/gender. My interest in Taron got me into the femboy community and I've been flirting with the idea of identifying as demiboy or something similar. 

I love the idea of being masculine but having femme qualities. Something about it just really tickles my fancy. It's not sexual or fetishy, dont worry, I just love the energy and aesthetic of femboys. Is it possible to be mostly gender neutral but also identify as a femboy? That's probably a question for a separate post. 

I guess it could help if I try to see what pronouns I like first and maybe that could help me figure it out. I know for sure I hate she/her so that's a definite no go. I like they/them and the few instances I heard it used for me it felt pretty good so I guess that's a good sign. I've flirted with the idea of trying out he/him but I've never told anyone. 

Idk, I guess for now I'll say I'm genderfluid but if you guys have any ideas of labels that might fit me better I'd be happy to hear them :)",ugt1cz,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/ugt1cz/first_i_thought_i_was_cis_then_alysgender_then/,[]

Hi there. Hope you're doing well!

For most of my life, I've felt like a cis woman - but I've recently been questioning whether I might be genderfluid. The weird thing, though, is that my gender seems to shift according to particular triggers. 

Like, most of the time, I feel like a woman because that's what I'm used to. When I start talking to people, any other semblance of gender experience tends to melt away because I naturally shift to the state I'm used to being in. When I get stressed or need to focus, I tend to feel very male - and feel these small sparks of discomfort when someone says ""she"" or ""here, wear this, you'll look really pretty in this"". When I'm on my own or about to sleep, I often feel more non-binary or even agender. 

However, I think the BIGGEST change for me is related to this sense of ""emptiness"". I've struggled for ages with the sensation of being emotionally numb and shut down; it would just happen randomly sometimes and it would be so frustrating because it felt like I didn't have much control over it. But nowadays, when the emptiness hits, I imagine myself as male - and all of a sudden, it just feels so much easier to handle. It's still there, but now it just feels cozy or 'chill' instead of painful. 

Sorry for the long post! I think I'm just a bit unsure of what to make of it because most people I've seen seem to talk about gender fluidity as something that just \*happens\* at random rather than something that's triggered. TLDR - I'm wondering if the label is still applicable in my case or if I'm maybe dealing with something different entirely?",ufk3pg,71,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/ufk3pg/is_it_normal_for_gender_to_fluctuate_in_response/,"['I don‚Äôt know if ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is a relevant word here, but you‚Äôre not alone.

I‚Äôm what a tomboy is for AFAB; it would be unremarkable if our culture was equal in the options for each sex, but there‚Äôs a whole rainbow of accepted unremarkable options to AFAB that not only are taboo for AMAB, but for me at least I wasn‚Äôt aware even existed. It was easier for me to conceptualize and believe I was trans than that I am the male counterpart to a tomboy. Has anyone even heard ‚Äútomgirl‚Äù? See what I mean? \n\nOne thing I‚Äôd add though, is that trauma played a big part in my gender queerness all along. So I just don‚Äôt know if I was born this way or made this way. On one level it doesn‚Äôt matter, but on another, it does. \n\nMy mother really wanted a girl, and when she was pregnant with me, she believed I would be a girl. All my early clothes and decor bought before birth were pink and yellow. My female name was thoughtfully considered, my male name was an afterthought because of course I was a girl. Not sure if my parents found out before I was born or as I was, that I am male. My mother never really accepted that, or rather she was resentful of it. \n\nRecently I realized my mother is likely on the spectrum, as my brother is. This likely affected her perceptions and beliefs, and it likely impacted her ability to be a parent. She never should have been a parent. My dad too for that matter, he had too traumatic a life, and hardly even had parents, neither knew what they were doing and both were so self absorbed. The apple didn‚Äôt fall far from the tree. ü§¶\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è \n\nSo my mother was very physically and emotionally abusive, and very physically and emotionally neglectful. I was rarely properly disciplined in a structured and logical way; rather, I was beaten when I reminded her of my existence. She always retreated into zoning out in front of the tv, and like my brother she raged out when distracted from her screen zombie time. Sometimes I was merely berated, but usually beaten, always with her saying hurtful stuff like ‚ÄúI wish I had girls‚Äù, ‚ÄúI hate boys‚Äù, ‚Äúyou should have been a girl‚Äù, ‚ÄúI wish I never had you‚Äù, I wish you were never born‚Äù, etc. And there‚Äôs worse. Point is, I was almost certainly knocked off my axis by my early years. \n\nThen add in the homophobia of the time that my parents were very much into. I‚Äôve always been into girls and then women, but in my early years I came off as not so masculine. The second or third He-Man toy I picked was Teela, and the adults in my family were alarmed. My uncle bet my other uncle $1000 in 1985 money that I would turn out gay. (He wound up losing his six figure sales job to losing everything and giving blowjobs for crack on the streets; whether he was bi or whether the crack was just that good, ü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è. Point is, the adults sensed I wasn‚Äôt traditional masculine at an early age. In their culture, the only alternative to that was gay. Gay was AIDS, gay was YMCA, ‚Äúdirty queers‚Äù, etc. At school, one of the ‚Äúgames‚Äù my peers played was ‚Äúsmear the queer‚Äù, which was a mob beating of any kid who acted gay in any given moment at recess. So I quickly learned how to imitate and emulate to fine details the gestures, walk, talk, everything of my male classmates. I was ostracized and isolated early though, because my only friend was the only black girl in our grade, and of course our culture was racist AF also. Eventually I made friends with other kids whose parents beat them. We had a clique for a few years. \n\nFast forward to age 18, my friend group was into Rocky Horror Picture Show. One of them, our ringleader sorta, had all the guys dress up in her lingerie. All us guys were nervous, and while I felt normal in it soon enough, nothing clicked; my stuff was deeply repressed. Then a few years later, I bought an off the shelf Halloween Snow White adult costume on a whim. No idea at the time what drove it. My friends laughed, and I was so embarrassed that I secretly threw it out. It was a WTF at the time. Then nothing for almost 20 years. \n \nAround age 40, went through a relationship that came and went, nothing. Then got my heart broken by a crush, and in my pain, bought some male fitting panties on Amazon. Like before, it was really random, no idea what drove it, but when I put them on, instant catharsis and comfort, and strength. I felt healed from what I didn‚Äôt yet know was broken. \n\nIn the few years after, I delved deeper into crossdressing, realizing early I‚Äôd never pass, and then with the help of my best friend, explored it further, and explored my gender identity further. \n\nSkipping over a lot, but I‚Äôve noticed that current life re traumatizations that overlay early traumas are like gasoline on the fire of my femme side. The extreme isolation of the pandemic‚Ä¶ I crash landed in my mothers house in my 20s, and didn‚Äôt escape until my early 40s (grateful for the alternative to homelessness but never should have gone back), moving out in 2020 to live alone in a new town where I knew no one, that isolation like my childhood, I delved really deep into my femme side. In time, I noticed my gender expression fluctuate with the input of my life. Emotional traumas flared it up. Yet, it‚Äôs definitely part of me. \n\nI haven‚Äôt wore nail polish in months, but I do my makeup some nights, and wear eyeliner to work every day. My daytime style is very androgynous, and at home fully femme most of the time.

642,Questioning my gender identity," Hi everyone. Hoping some of you could help me a but with your experiences or just advice.

I've been questioning my gender identity a lot recently. I'm female but have always dressed more masculine. I've always felt pretty comfortable with that but always had this bit of a feeling that female isn't right for me. Sometimes I've wished I was and felt it would be better if I was male but not always. I've always had these feelings and been uncomfortable with my chest area and recently started binding it. The first time I saw my chest flatter I felt this wave of joy and it just felt right. It isn't something I want to do all the time but it's felt right the times I have.

I guess I just don't know to even work out who I am? I don't really feel like either and kind of sway between them a little I guess. I don't know if i'm just cis female but want to bind my chest or if there are other parts. Some days i feel like i want a beard, no chest and other days i'm pretty comfortable with my body and as I am.

I'm also engaged and in a long term relationship with a guy who has commented before that they would prefer me to be more feminine so I'm worried about how to go about telling him I'm exploring this and about the chest binding.

645,Soooo sick of cis people arguing with me and defining what trans and/or nonbinary mean because of their own misunderstanding of the nomenclature,"I'm fully aware that not all nb/gq people identify with the label ""trans"", and it's everyone's prerogative to choose whatever labels they're most comfortable with. Outside of that individual labeling though, cisgender means ""agrees with assigned gender"" and transgender means ""disagrees with assigned gender"", ergo anyone who's not cis is trans.

I put it like this:

>Male/man, female/woman, nonbinary, genderqueer, gender fluid et al are gender identities. Cis and trans are different ways of being male or female, and not being male or female is being nonbinary, and being non-binary is not identifying with your assigned gender.

>If genders weren't assigned, people would still go on to be between/beyond the binary. That is to say, cis and trans are cultural concepts that are only relevant to a system in which genders are assigned at birth. A non-binary person would still be nonbinary, but wouldn't be cis or trans because they wouldn't have been assigned a gender.

But I'm constantly finding myself in arguments about this, predominantly with cis (queer) people. That being the case, I wanted to come have a discussion with people these terms actually apply to because having cis binary people tell me what my identifying terms mean is absolutely crazy making.

Do you agree? Does being nb/gq/gf/etc make someone trans? I can understand why people have a bit of imposter syndrome claiming the term ""trans"", and that's their own choice to make, but cis and trans are fully inclusive of all potential gender identities (rather than being gender identities themselves) in the sense that they literally mean ""the side of their assigned gender"" and ""the other side of their assigned gender"". You either agree with your assigned binary label or you don't, so everyone is either cis or trans.

P.S. I'd love to have a **civil, friendly** discussion about this. Feel free to disagree and tell me why, but please try to be kind when doing so.",ud8r9b,168,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/ud8r9b/soooo_sick_of_cis_people_arguing_with_me_and/,"['Each individual should have the right to define and describe their own relationship with gender in the terms they find appropriate.\n\nHowever, it is still useful to be able to talk about groups of people, and since nonbinary people as a group are inherently affected by transgender issues, they should be included as a group when we talk about ""transgender people"".\n\nLike, not all pansexual people also identify as bisexual, but when we\'re talking about biphobia and the stigma against multi-gender attracted people, pansexual people (and multi-gender attracted queer people who don\'t use either terms, etc) are implicitly included in that population.', ""I had a hard time thinking of myself under the trans umbrella because I'm genderqueer in that I'm agender, so it's not that I identify with a different gender than assaigned at birth but that I don't. \n\nHonestly, what pushed me into acceptance of being under the trans umbrella is the way TERFs think of how I identify (I'm AFAB), so they assume it's internalized misogyny and discredit my gender identity/expressions. So I moved under that nice umbrella for solidarity and support. Imposter syndrome hits, but so it goes for nearly everyone"", 'I do like the way you defined trans as not identifying with your assigned binary label, and how these terms only carry as much meaning as the societies and cultures give them at this specific time period.\n\nIt\'s interesting to me because as a nonbinary person myself I go back and forth between considering myself trans and... not trans. I don\'t think I would ever consider myself cis, but I do experience that ""imposter syndrome"" you mentioned about identifying as trans. I guess this might be because when I think of ""trans"" the first thing I think of are binary trans people, who maybe have even transitioned and experience great dysphoria, are victims of hate crimes and harassment, etc. I myself appear very cis much of the time and so I have the ""privilege"" of not presenting as not cis. This I feel contributes to my hesitancy to adopt the label of ""trans"" for myself, but it then also begs the question: How much of an identity is defined by suffering, or a specific kind of shared suffering that a group experiences?\n\nIt reminds me of TERFS who largely use logic like ""REAL women menstruate, which is a type of suffering that all REAL women share, and anyone who does not suffer in this specific way therefore cannot identify as a REAL woman"". I am obviously trying to stray far far away from any kind of logic that TERFS use, but I have to admit that a big reason why I don\'t always identify as trans is because I feel like maybe I haven\'t suffered enough, or suffered in a specific way that binary trans folks do.\n\nI have to do more thinking about this, but right now all I have is that I personally consider myself either trans or not trans, but never cis. Aside from the suffering stuff I mentioned, ""not trans"" suits me in the way that every once in a while I do feel okay/ambivalent to my assigned gender at birth... so if I feel okay with it sometimes and not others, where do I fall in the binary of trans or cis? Or would you consider me trans still because even though I sometimes feel okay with my assigned gender at birth, I still am not okay with it at other times? And with a trans or cis binary, would it be possible to acknowledge that a person could perhaps be ambivalent or even identify with their assigned gender at birth socially/in particular social contexts but not individually/within themselves or in other social contexts?', 'I agree with your dictionary style definitions, but I think the reality is just more complicated than that.\n\nThe thing about identity labels is that they\'re serving a dual role. They are *both* dictionary definition defining a category *and* describing an actual real world group of people. If we go strictly by definitions, you\'re right. *But*, realistically, these words also describe groups of people and communities who have complex and ever-evolving relationships with each other and with the words they use to describe themselves and each other. Whether a person feels the word applies to them is going to depend strongly on how closely they feel their experiences align with the experiences of other people in the group. (And to some extent on other things like imposter syndrome, internalized bias, external bias, whathaveyou, but I do think the driving factor behind whether someone takes or rejects a label is how relatable they find the other people who use the label.)\n\nSo consider the group of people actually described by the word transgender. The overwhelming majority of transgender people either have transitioned, are transitioning, or want to transition in some way, shape, or form. And consider the people actually described by the word cisgender. The overwhelming majority of cisgender people have never had to seriously consider their gender, and of those who have they\'ve found their gender as it was assumed at birth to be a good fit. So what about a nonbinary person who\'s obviously found their gender as assumed at birth to be incorrect, but also has no interest in transitioning? What group best suits them? Maybe they feel that the lack of transitioning makes them relate more to cis people. Maybe they feel that the shared experience of questioning their gender and realizing it wasn\'t what other people thought makes them relate more to trans people. Maybe they feel like neither of these groups are relatable and prefer to avoid either group. It\'s complicated. What they feel is most accurate to their own experience may not align with the dictionary definition.\n\nThis kind of misalignment between \'dictionary definition\' and what is actually happening among real people is longstanding and ongoing in queer communities, for a whole laundry list of reasons. I think it actually used to be much more commonly felt that identity labels weren\'t set in stone, were far from perfect, and were mainly a jumping off point to say ""this is the group of people I find most relatable."" In my experience, the pivot towards identity labels as dictionary definition boxes to fit into is relatively new. While I understand it, I don\'t really vibe with it. I think sexual orientation, sexuality, romantic orientation, gender, sex, etc are all really complicated, that the ways we talk about them are constantly evolving, and that it\'s more important for people to be able to choose the words they feel most accurately describe their own experience than for those words to fit their dictionary definition perfectly. \n\nSo like, in the dictionary, yeah, everyone is either cis or trans. But IRL there are people who feel like neither of those words give a correct impression of their actual experience. And I personally think that\'s fine.\n\nAnyway yeah, that\'s my kind of wordy 2¬¢ as someone who considers themself both nonbinary and trans. :)', 'I agree with you on all accounts, except the utility of arguing with bigots. I think there are better uses of your time.', 'I agree with your logic - that cis and trans are broader terms and the other labels can be, but not always, more clearly defined. \n\nI don\'t get why anyone disagrees with another\'s chosen label. Things like this have different meaning based on our own knowledge and life experiences. Personally I don\'t care about labels, but definitely am in the non-binary/genderfluid/genderqueer realm.\n\nMy ""true identity"" is really only known to me, but if I was public with it I would see labels more as a way to describe to others how I fit into the world, not as much how I ""identify."" Does that make sense? If I had to explain what a term means, or if it just confuses people then it\'s not really helpful to bother sharing that with others.\n\nI like to say I simply identity as ""human""', 'I asked a similar question on r/trans recently. Mostly got very affirming feedback that nonbinary/genderqueer folk are implicitly trans with a lot of people making the caveat ‚Äúunless they don‚Äôt identify with the label‚Äù which made sense to me. I only got like two people telling me I‚Äôm not trans, and only a few bigots that the mods sorted out really quickly.\n\nI have had a lot of conversations over the years too, including the years I still tried to identify as cis that they thought nonbinary was just kind of a sidestepping gender or staying out of it. I‚Äôve heard things like ‚ÄúI sometimes feel kinda nonbinary‚Äù sometimes in a way that carried the same energy as people who call themselves ‚Äúa little OCD‚Äù cause they like to organize their bookshelves. Sometimes I think it‚Äôs also similar to the cis people who think I must like drag shows cause I‚Äôm trans. Definitely alot of misunderstanding outside trans circles what being nonbinary is.\n\nOne comment that really stuck with me from my post was one commenter said that being nonbinary is about what your gender really is, and being trans is about the journey from an assigned gender to any other gender. If one day it becomes possible for kids to be assigned nonbinary at birth or to self-assign when they reach whatever age they settle into, then it could become possible for nonbinary to be cis.

Action vs Disposition \n\nI hope that makes sense as to how I feel as accepting transgender as my personal title and why I generally opt for Non-binary instead.', 'I agree with your broader definition of trans, and that, while many nb/gq people don\'t identify that way personally, trans as an umbrella term potentially includes all nb/gq people.\n\nI haven\'t often encountered cis people argue against this. However, if they did, I would perceive it as very rude.\n\nIt\'s frustrating enough when binary trans people argue with me, not particularly respectfully, about this issue. In my experience I have only ever seen this argument from binary trans people, and there I have only gotten it from a subset of them, particularly, transmedicalists.\n\nI have *some* empathy for these people. A lot of them are older trans people who grew up with different terminology and there is a degree to which they are frustrated with the terminology changing and including people under the ""trans umbrella"" whose experience is very different from their own, which can make it a lot harder for them to connect with like-minded people. So it sort of feels like people are stealing their label.\n\nI get it.\n\nBut I still disagree with transmedicalism.\n\nOne thought I had, because transmedicalism still runs rampant in our society, I think a lot of cis queer people actually buy into various parts of it to varying degrees, so what you may be running up against is that you may be running into people who buy into varying degrees of this ideology. And it can be frustrating, because the ideology can be hugely problematic, very judgey and gatekeepy of who is considered trans, and can direct a lot of negativity at nb/gq people and other people who don\'t fit the ""one size fits all"" trans narrative.\n\nSo yeah, I definitely feel you on this stuff. In my case though I have mostly encountered this sort of argument from other trans people, usually binary trans people who hold transmedicalist views.', 'One thing that I am pretty sure people get hung up on in this debate, though they don\'t often explain it like this, is that they want to have separate labels for ""people who feel/identify outside the binary"" and ""people who are taking medical/legal/etc. actions to transition."" And so only the outwardly changing people count as ""trans"" to them, and the people who don\'t transition in such a way are ""only nonbinary.""\n\nThis is obviously not how the trans community has defined the word trans, and also not how the cis people tend to explain it, but I\'m pretty sure this is what\'s happening! Because they never seem to be excluding nonbinary people who are clearly medically transitioning - nonbinary friend who has had surgeries ""counts"" to them, while friend who came out about pronouns and isn\'t doing anything medically ""doesn\'t count"" to them. So they have this definition of trans that includes ""official changes,"" and they\'re arguing specifically with the nonbinary people that they don\'t see making those changes. \n\nI really wish there *was* a specific word for people who are changing things about their hormones, body parts, documents, clothes, as opposed to people who are not transitioning in that way. I think it would help make it clear to these people that nonbinary does fall under the trans umbrella. Some nonbinary people fall under this... thing-there-isn\'t-a-word-for, and some people do not have a need for those things, but they all count as trans (unless, as people have stated, the individual doesn\'t want to identify as trans).']"

647,Heavily questioning my gender identity,"Hello, beautiful people, 

I would like to ask for some guidance because, honestly, I have no idea who to ask or how to figure this out by myself. 

To sum it all up, I've been questioning my gender identity for a long time now, but it never felt like I have the right to do this. On top of that, my reasons felt shallow and I feel like I am taking up the space of those with actual gender dysphoria.

I am a cis man, bi/pan, who spent his entire life fighting the idea of ""man"". I grew up among girls (up until recently all of my friends were mostly female) because boys bullied me for not being a real man, as well as my father bullying me for the same reason. 

Naturally, I became a feminist, but I kid you not that I hate traditional masculinity with a passion. The simple thought of being put in the same box with other cis men makes me feel icky about myself, yet...yet I was born cis and I don't want to come across as a ""pick me"".

It took me a long time to accept my feminine side too, right now I am exploring more and more of it, but I can't say that I feel drawn to femininity as a gender expression past makeup, nails and some outfits, nor to female as an identity. 

I just don't feel like nor do I want to be a man, it doesn't resonate with me at all, but I enjoy having a mostly masc gender expression. Yet, I also feel like my reasons aren't right, that I am just trespassing into the territory of actual enbies or people with different genders. 

I am not looking for validation, although that would be nice too, as much as I am looking for some directions. My brain works on labels, it's quite systematic, so I need to figure out an identity that works for me without feeling like I am claiming to be something other people truly are and I am just ...

649,I think internalized transphobia is making it hard for me to question my gender?,"I‚Äôm not exactly sure what my goal is by posting this, but I think it‚Äôs mostly looking for camaraderie or similar experiences and how other people have moved forward!

I‚Äôm 19 y/o AMAB, and I‚Äôve been questioning my relationship with my gender for over a year now (maybe 2? Not sure, but you get the idea). As the title suggests, I‚Äôve had a very hard time acknowledging that I might not be a man. It‚Äôs a bit of a doozy, so I‚Äôll try to stay organized. I‚Äôd also like to preface this by saying I‚Äôm not like homophobic or transphobic, I‚Äôll explain the title better in the body text.

When I was little, I always wanted to grow up and become like a businessman, I imagined myself as some office worker architect in a suit. I had a decent mix of boys and girls as friends, and I think all in all, I was a pretty generic description of a ‚Äúyoung boy‚Äù

Starting in middle or early high school, my friend group started leaning toward more girls than boys, but I still had the same general image of myself. Of course puberty started, and while I‚Äôve come to realize I‚Äôm a bit bi (general preference for women), I was mostly focused on what girls would want to date me and things like that. Again, pretty ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù stuff. 

During that same time period in middle school and early high school, I fell into the right wing rabbit hole of YouTube that you may or may not be aware of. Anti-SJW, people who made fun of peoples appearance and anything on the left (LGBT community a part of that of course). This I think is the start of my problems. My family eventually straightened me out (away from the far right, not my sexuality lol) and I moved on.

I forget what prompted my initial questioning, but again it was a year or two ago. There was a general shift in my thinking when I saw photos of women, from ‚ÄúI think they look nice‚Äù to ‚Äúdo I want to look like that?‚Äù I‚Äôd see fan art of feminine characters from shows and instead of that ‚ÄúI like that, it looks good!‚Äù I‚Äôd get a pang of jealousy at how they looked in a crop top or the shape of their body or how skirts or dresses look on them. 

For a while I flipped back and forth on the subject. I currently identify as genderfluid for that reason. (Since this applies to past and present I might switch tense randomly, sorry lol) Sometimes when I feel masculine, I almost get mad at myself for ever thinking I wanted to be a girl, like a backlash if that makes sense? But I can‚Äôt tell if I truly feel that way, or if it stems from another emotion I‚Äôll describe: 

When I open my mind and let myself express myself freely with the feminine clothes my girlfriend has bought for me, I feel amazing at first. It‚Äôs SO fun and freeing, but the longer I focus on it the more I get a similar pang in my heart. I notice all the features about me that don‚Äôt match how I feel. And that feeling remains constant until I stop, and I think that might be when I get that backlash feeling? As if I‚Äôm mad at myself for exploring that option knowing how it would make me feel?

In December 2020, while I was still a senior in high school, I had a longer period of time where I was feeling feminine and embracing it. I told my family I was trans. I told my friends. I picked out a trial run name that I ended up keeping to myself for the duration hahaha. I was so happy and relieved. When I feel feminine, I feel like nothing fits me better than the term lesbian, I feel like any time I ‚Äúwanted‚Äù to be masculine I would have been happy channeling that from a base of femininity, and I do anything to present more feminine when I‚Äôm alone and feeling like that.

My whole family was very supportive, and so were my friends. My dad was the only exception, who emphasized that I think long and hard before an announcement like that, and made very sure I wasn‚Äôt doing anything medical. He came around, and was okay with it, but didn‚Äôt understand to use she/her still. He said he was worried about my career because of it. I think that might have been an influence?

Things began feeling weird or different, and I can‚Äôt tell if that was my gut telling me I identified myself wrong, or if I was simply struggling with change. I also can‚Äôt tell if still being called a masculine name brought up like doubt or nostalgia? A few days later I sent a text to my family saying to drop the trans thing and that was that. I was a bit more detailed my friends, telling them I was genderfluid instead. I felt humiliated, and as if I had proven my dads thoughts correct that I had rushed into something that was wrong or not for me.

I‚Äôm opening my mind again, since I closed off a lot of the possibility of being feminine after the embarrassment I had felt, and I‚Äôm even considering exploring the possibility of HRT. When I‚Äôm feeling feminine, I feel disheartened that I didn‚Äôt take steps earlier, but when I feel masculine, I yell at myself for almost taking them (again, I can‚Äôt tell if I really do feel wholly ‚Äúmasculine.‚Äù I think it might be the backlash from being anxious about change?)

Anyway, I guess if I had a main question  or two I‚Äôm trying to get across, it‚Äôd be these: has anybody has this ‚Äúbacklash at yourself‚Äù feeling? If so, what happened moving forward? Similarly, has anybody related to the feeling of wanting to present as your assigned gender, but from a base of something else? (That was worded poorly: in my case, I mean like I want to present as a man, but be a woman, instead of present as a woman but be a man)

And picked up a lot of that growing up. And therefore had a lot of repression going on, and why I think I started questioning a little later in life. Going to college was the first time I had actually started questioning all the prejudice I'd grown up with, and now that I'm actually questioning my own gender, have been working through a lot of this 'internalized transphobia' with my therapist and it has made all the exploration that much harder.\n\nI've been questioning for about a year or so now, and have had a similar experience, I shared with my partner that I was questioning my gender at first, but then every time I'm not questioning, feel anger at myself and embarrassed for even bringing it up in the first place - kind of like the 'backlash' that you mentioned.\n\nIn terms of moving forward, I'm still in the midst of it so I don't want it to be one of those -blind leading the blind- moments lol but the thing I have found that has helped me the most is talking with those in similar circumstances as myself, hearing other points of view, along with therapy (not sure how viable that is for you).

I feel as if this would only be possible with HRT and/or top surgery, but I\'m not sure if that\'s what I *actually* want.   \nMaybe it\'s internalized transphobia, maybe it\'s something else, who knows.  \n\n\nWhat\'s worse is that my gender is not fully static, so my dysphoria varies a lot. Some days I feel fine in my body and my voice and how others perceive me, and on other days I want nothing more than to be a fully transitioned trans man and be perceived as such.  \n\n\nThen there\'s the problem of feeling too connected to my AGAB and my history as being everyone\'s little girl in the family etc. etc., which I often believe is the biggest thing holding me back from coming out to my family. Being the only ""girl"" cousin and grandchild in the family puts much pressure on me to be and behave and look a certain way and I have often conformed to that even when it\'s uncomfortable.  \n\n\nShit is really difficult. Until then I (and perhaps you) will dress as I want and not take any shit from others.

653,"so confused about my gender, please help (long post)","Dude, I don't know what the fuck is up with me.¬† I'm not sure if I'm a girl or a trans boy or nonbinary or what.¬† I have always been gender nonconforming to a degree. 

4 years old- hated wearing ruffly girly clothes.¬† I remember thinking it would be physically painful to put on a shirt with ruffles because I hated it so much. 
5-7 y.o.- I found out older boys got hairy legs and got super fascinated with my own leg hair.¬† Wanted to be a ""hairy legged boy"".¬† Sometimes adopted alternate personas when I would play, I always imagined I was a boy.¬† I don't think I really identified with girlhood at all as a young child.¬† I think I mostly wanted to be a boy.
I was very tomboy, wore my brother's clothes.
At one point I ""changed my style"" wanted to look more girly for a while.¬† 
8-9 y.o.- went back to mostly boy clothes.¬† My friends were mostly boys but I did have some female friends.¬† I remember wanting to join boy scouts with my brother, partially just to be included in a ""boy"" group.¬† I got mistaken for a boy a couple times that stand out in my mind.  I remember one time crying to my mom that I wanted to be a boy and asking her to take me to the doctor and have them make me a boy, but I think this only happened once.  I definitely did want to be a boy though.
10-12 y.o.- puberty kicks in and I actually take a very girly turn.¬† This was definitely my most girly era.¬† I had a big crush on one boy but I was pretty boy-crazy overall.¬† I did have a crush on one girl, but I didn't realize it was a crush until later.¬† I wore very girly clothes, was excited to start my period and get breasts, acted very feminine, wore a lot of makeup, I was in a dance troupe which was very girly.¬† Basically I hit puberty and I was fine with it, I enjoyed being girly even though I was still slightly tomboy.¬† All my friends were girls, I had a couple ""boyfriends"", this was my main girly era.
13 y.o.- I started to realize I'm bisexual.¬† I had feelings for girls moreso than boys but because of my homophobic family I refused to believe I could be bi. I got really depressed.¬† I got way less girly, changed to a no makeup, jeans and a tshirt style, realized I do not really identify with or want to emulate any women, only men.¬† All my role models were men, and I wished I could be taken seriously like them as a man.¬† I become aware of the feeling that ""I wish I was a boy"", but because I didn't think ""I am a boy"", I wasn't trans.
Through my teen years I identified with and emulated men and boys, but didn't identify as a boy.¬† I expressed myself in my writing as a boy (except when writing strictly autobiographical) and didn't identify with any female characters, only male.¬† Hawkeye Pierce, Sherlock, Han Solo, Holden Caulfield, Travis Bickle, etc etc etc.¬† I was vaguely fascinated with the idea of being nonbinary but didn't allow myself to consider that I could be. 

I always have and still do wish I was born a boy 100%.¬† I still mainly identify with a male point of view and have never really felt like a ""real girl"" or like I can ""do girl right"".¬† Last summer I took a lot of mushrooms and got honest with myself that I might be nonbinary.¬† I adopted a more masc presentation and I feel really really good about it. I'm coming to grips with the fact that I might not be a cis girl, but I have no idea what the fuck I am.¬† I don't mind being seen as a girl and I'm really scared to try to transition because of the social consequences.¬† I don't mind being called she/her or being seen as a girl but I also like being called masculine terms and I have realized that I feel like a boy a lot of the time.¬† However I also feel like a girl sometimes and I truly enjoy being feminine sometimes.¬† I don't want to get rid of my breasts but sometimes I feel like I wouldn't mind going on Testosterone.¬† Like I would like the deep voice, body hair, muscle mass, facial changes, etc.¬† But the idea of everyone seeing me as a boy seems weird and uncomfortable because I've been socialized as a girl so long that I'm comfortable with it.¬† I don't really experience a lot of dysphoria and don't mind being seen as a girl, but I do feel like I identify a lot more deeply with boyhood.¬† Being a girl is the path of least resistance for me and I feel like I would be ok with that, even though I wish I was born a boy but I wish I could just be a boygirl with boobs and hairy legs.¬† What the fuccccckkkk is going on???????",uc2b7n,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/uc2b7n/so_confused_about_my_gender_please_help_long_post/,[]

I know I'm probably catastrophizing, but I don't know how much that can possibly be true. 

I'm already realizing why my height bothers me a great deal and that's something I can't change. I'm 4'11 and I find that an extremely feminine aspect of me. There's just no way I can turn or twist it. There's short guys, but no guy is 4'11(I mean feel free to prove me wrong). I feel like it just screams to people that I'm afab.

(Easily being carried and the like) 

Otherwise I like looking more on the feminine side(though androgyny is my goal, I like a little femininity in a boyish way) I'm scared that I'll change my mind later in life and that I'll want to hypermasculine (cause that's definitely *not* what I want.)

661,Not sure if GNC or genderqueer (?? Not sure if dysphoric ??),"[LONG- Estimated reading time: 3 min]

(afab) My whole life I did not give any fucks about gender roles. I didn't really mind being called a girl/woman but also didn't know there were other ways to be. (I lived under a rock--went to very small parochial school grades 2-12.) I do remember resenting new expectations of femininity and actively rejected skirt school uniform once I began puberty. Getting breasts was annoying, I absolutely hated suddenly being told I had to wear uncomfortable tit-harnesses everyday, but I don't know that I ever really felt what could be called dysphoria at that age. 

I wanted to be a knight in shining armor. I liked bugs and lizards etc. and legitimately did not understand why all the other girls didn't think those things were fun. I called myself a tomboy. I desperately wanted to be a shapeshifter and run away to live in the woods as a wild animal so I don't have to deal with society ever again. 

I'm also probably autistic, or some flavor of neurodivergent, and I learned to mask really well. It's only in the last couple years I've starting investigating this (a friend gave me Tony Attwood's book and I was like *holy shit, was this guy hiding in the bushes taking notes on my childhood?*) 

Gender norms don't really make sense to me (much like a lot of social things), and I learned to mask really well and behave in a way people expected of me or would get favorable social reactions so I could survive (or at least win the approval of teachers if not peers), so there are many habits I have that are feminine ways of speaking and featuring etc but they don't feel like *me* just a role I'm playing. But the more I try to unmask the more I feel weirded out when I notice myself doing those things. I hate how my voice gets so high while I'm trying to people-please. 

I started to try different ways of being during the plague, I quit bras in favor of honoring my sensory needs [except for formal occasions :/] and I'm starting to realize that I feel a lot more comfortable in masc styles and masc underclothes, and buzzed the back of my head WHICH I LOVVVE and cut my hair shorter than it's every been (tho not actually short-short. (My hair's always been long bc I hate strangers touching my head so haircuts are No Thank You. (Plus I'm about to be job hunting soon and think it will be easier in interviews if I have a more stereotypical appearance.))) 

And for the first time in my life I'm noticing I feel *really uncomfortable* about my breasts. Like I enjoy them for, uh, intimate purposes, but I REALLY DO NOT want them to be perceived. And I'm not sure that's bc I'm uncomfortable bc of misogynistic male gaze reasons, or that thing people called dysphoria. That. What is that?? Is this feeling dysphoria? AHHHHH- 

üçÜ>!And as far as genitalia, sometime in my teens I have a distinct memory of learning about intersex people and wondering in shock if I was born with a penis and doctors had removed it when I was an infant so I could be a ""normal"" girl. I have had hallucinations about having a dick. I have worn a strapless strap-on and felt intense joy and really like being called a good boy. I assumed that was just a kink thing but now I'm really beginning to question if it's just that. !<

There are actually at least 7 different types of dysphoria. \nAlso, labels are descriptive‚Äîthey merely put a word to your identity or presentation, nothing more. Please don‚Äôt let them prescribe who you are. Be yourself and if a label is useful, great, if not, then no labels work too.

669,Rant about terminology,"Hello, go easy on me, I‚Äôm putting out some tender feelings and unfinished ideas.

I don‚Äôt like some of the terminology around gender, sex and identity.

The common use of of AMAB, AFAB and AGAB to describe someone‚Äôs sex seems clumsy to me. I am thinking lately of using e.g. ‚Äúmale-sex‚Äù, ‚Äúnatal male‚Äù to describe sex.

I also don‚Äôt like the word ‚Äútrans‚Äù. I know it‚Äôs meant to be an umbrella for those whose gender doesn‚Äôt match their sex, but it feels profoundly inadequate.",u8hi2g,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/u8hi2g/rant_about_terminology/,"[""Personally, if someone tried to refer to me as a 'natal female' I'd be rather put off by it. I think that there's a bit too much focus on agab in a lot of spaces as is, tbh. I'd much rather we just stopped referring to it so much, especially since it can over-simplify issues. e.g binding is often put in afab resource lists, but I've met amab ppl who chose to bind their chest after hrt. Ofc, terms can be quite personal and this is one where I can rly see why it woud vary from person to person. Having more options in language is never a bad thing.\n\nI def feel you with trans through, the common association is with binary trans people to such a degree that I've met several people who didn't realize that being nonbinary meant that I was trans. (ik some nb ppl chooses not to use the term but I mean receiving genuine confusion when I used the label for myself)"", 'The terms AFAB and AMAB introduce an important distinction that you may be missing, which is that AFAB and AMAB do not refer to objective biological sex, only to the (subjective) assignment of sex into two categories, which is a sociocultural phenomenon that is not always in harmony with scientific knowledge or biology. There are several angles from which you can understand this.\n\nOne such angle is intersex people, who are likely more common than you realize. I personally know two intersex people in person and more online, and it is likely I know even more, since people are rarely open to the general public about being intersex. Intersex people are born with a biological sex that is not unambiguously female or male, yet they are nearly always assigned a binary sex at birth. So for example, I have a friend who is chromosomally male but presented female at birth and was AFAB as a result. This person\'s sex is intersex, but they are AFAB, and their gender happens to be nonbinary.\n\nMedical transition also alter\'s a person\'s biology. Biological sex includes outward manifestations such as primary and secondary sex characteristics, as well as internal ones such as hormonal profiles. Hormonal transition changes a person\'s hormone profile and secondary sex characteristics, so if someone hormonally transitions it does not make sense to say that their ""sex"" is what they were assigned at birth. It has now become more complex.\n\nThere is even a fairly strong case to be made that, even for people not normally considered intersex, biological sex is not a binary and the idea of forcing it into a binary is a cultural one, not a scientific one. See [this 2015 article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/518288a) which is one of the most respected scientific journals in the world.\n\n---\n\nAs for the word ""trans"", if you don\'t want to use the word ""trans"" to refer to yourself, that\'s fine. There are numerous nonbinary and/or genderqueer people who feel similarly, just as there are also numerous of us who identify as trans. Some of us (I\'m in this category) do identify as trans even though we sometimes feel slightly uncomfortable with the label; in my case it is because people wrongly assume that trans means that I either want or have already carried out medical transition, whereas I don\'t want these things. There are plenty of other terms people can use. Genderqueer and nonbinary are great terms. Gender-non-conforming is useful for some people. You might explore the [nonbinary wiki](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Main_Page) to find other terminology. I find some of the more esoteric identities useful; for example, the closest single term I\'ve found to describe my experience of gender and my identity is *agenderflux*.\n\nI would encourage you to keep questioning, exploring, and discussing terminology. It\'s important for us to do so, in order to address shortcomings or problems with the terminology, either with terminology that is already in use, or with new terminology we are considering using. It\'s also important for us to understand the rationale behind terminology shifts that have already taken place.\n\nI would, however, caution you against using terms like ""male sex"" or ""female sex"" to describe people who are, respectively, AMAB or AFAB. This could come across as offensive or dismissive to some people, and perhaps more importantly, it would not be truthful and might reinforce misconceptions about sex and gender, as it would blur the distinctions I made above, particularly as intersex people and people who have medically transitioned are concerned. AMAB and AFAB are widely accepted terms so less likely to offend. Sometimes you need to bow to the culture a little bit. I\'m open to questioning the dominant culture but you have not yet convinced me that your approach is an improvement over the status quo, and I think you\'d do well to consider some of the points here and integrate them into your thoughts, and see if that either makes the existing terminology make more sense to you, or perhaps helps you come up with *even better* terminology that addresses both your concerns, and these other issues.', 'Are you looking for discussion, debate, or just a place to share?', 'Choosing to refer to somebody by their birth sex or ""natal"" anatomy erases intersex people, who make up about an equal portion of the population as redheads.

675,Gender roles are meaningless (rant/expereince),"Hi friends, 24yo bi afab human here. she/her pronouns, identify as woman. 

Since I can remember, gender roles and stereotypes have always seemed obtuse to me. Such harshly restricted rules with outlandish expectations and social implications. Growing up in a pretty heteronormative culture, I adhered to these expectations as a young child. Judged those who seemed ""other"" and had a complete lack of understanding of non-hetero sexuality or even the concept of gender as a whole. 

Around 8/9 I found myself particularly intrigued by boyish things. I wanted short hair, army print cargo shorts (i loved those), nothing pink, a boy's bike, and for people not to see me simply as ""a pretty shy little girl"". I wanted to be rough and tumble, strong and smart. I even tried to pee standing up for a while lmao. 

Through the development of my identity in my teens, I was well aware that I rejected gender stereotypes and expectations. I was (and generally still am) comfortable in my identity as a woman. I just detest the overwhelming and restricting binary that society entraps us in. Our restrictive language and severe lack of education. The absolute perfectionism chokehold media has on humans to the point where we've lost the meaning of beauty and authenticity. (I cant stand most social media platforms for this reason). the constant need to cover with makeup and make each strand of hair lay just so, and SHAVING don‚Äôt even get me started on body hair. I'm ranting now, but you can feel my frustration. the false perception of life through a phone screen, ya dig?

But more and more I feel that my general distaste for society's binary isn‚Äôt just about society, but that I don't ascribe to it. Obviously, fuck gender norms bc of all the aforementioned, I'm a human that has no need to fit anyone's expectation. But I have started to reflect inwardly. Is it just societal perceptions I am fighting? or my own concept of gender? I feel as if I can describe myself as a ""woman+???""

I have feminine behaviors and intrests, but my attitudes feel genderless. I don‚Äôt fit into the (fake) boxes, which is fine.

1. Is it possible to identify as genderqueer but genderfluid in expressing gender? Right now I *think* I don‚Äôt really feel like a man or a woman but sometimes I feel more feminine and sometimes I feel very masculine which reflects in how I hold myself and talk and dress. 

2. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a common thing and would love to get feedback. I‚Äôm asexual & have never experienced sexual attraction. However I‚Äôm also sex repulsed. To be more specific and sorry if it‚Äôs TMI but I‚Äôm repulsed to the point of nausea at the thought of any kind of penetration. I don‚Äôt even use tampons. I did have a thought a few years ago that I might be more sex neutral or willing to have sex with a partner if I were the one doing the penetrating. Is this a sign of dysphoria or is it just a weird quirk? 

3. My body shape is very stereotypically feminine which means that most gender neutral or masculine clothes don‚Äôt fit me right. Even as baggy or straight jeans are coming back I can‚Äôt wear them because they don‚Äôt fit me right.

679,AMAB - Comfortable with He/Him - but uncaring about gender norms or even if others were to use other pronouns for me. Is there a term for me?,"Condensed version in the title, but sums it up mostly. I am AMAB, I've never been uncomfortable being referred to as male and, for all intents and purposes, am cis and have presented myself as such.

I am bisexual and, over the past few months, I've become more involved with queer spaces. As I've gotten more exposure to more open queerness I've realized a few things:

A: Pan probably fits me better than Bi, as gender doesn't have any bearing on my attraction

and B: I just.. don't care about my own gender. And it's been that way for a while.

Like, I'm fine being called a guy, I'm fine with he/him pronouns, I have no discomfort there.

But I also couldn't give less of a crap about gender norms and honestly I don't think I could care less if someone used female pronouns or consistently used they/them pronouns for me.

I'm not against the idea of myself having a gender so I don't feel like agender fits. I don't feel like genderfluid describes what I feel - I have seen ""Gender apathetic"" tossed around, and I think that probably fits the bill, but with how little knowledge I truly have I feel it's probably a good idea to actually talk to people with experience.

Could this also fall under ""Nah you're cis, just don't give a crap""? Or is that just like. The definition of Gender Apathetic in a nutshell?

Edit: Thank you for all the responses! Since a couple people mentioned it, I'm not fretting over labelling myself. For the most part I'm probably just going to stick with outwardly presenting as Cis but I wanted to explore it for personal introspection since it's been on my mind a lot lately.

Double Edit: Just to clear up because I've used the phrasing a couple times from lack of a better term for it off-hand - I'm saying ""presenting as cis"" mainly just to mean ""Everyone assumes I am cis, and because I have no issue with that, I give no indication otherwise"".

684,Seeking support after I was denied the X option when applying for my passport Tuesday. Going back tomorrow with a recorder,"Hi, I'm new here. I'm genetically/hormonally intersex and identify as non-binary with they/them pronouns. I'm having a full on panic attack and just tried to call 10 different crises hotlines to process, but each one had a preformed message telling me to call back later before disconnecting. So, I decided to come look for peer support here. 

 I was excited to be able to get a passport without having to put the incorrect gender on my application. I don't have access to a printer, so I got there extra early to fill out a form there. I was disappointed when the form didn't have the X option, but I figured it could be rectified somehow. I went and asked the agent how I could get my passport done correctly with the other option. She told me I couldn't, that I had to pick one of the real genders on the form. I said I am intersex, which the courts have declared a real gender and said I had to the right to have my passport accurately reflect that. She said the form is the form and when they eventually get new forms I can fill them out how I please. Then she called the next person. I left and immediately left a message with my local legal aid and then my community case manager. My CM was horrified for me, and said he would find the right forms for me and print them out. We agreed this was a bigger issue than just me though, and he assured me he would take the proper steps to address it and make the social worker community aware of it. 

My CM brought over the form today. I'm so nervous to fill it out. You aren't allowed to correct it if you make a mistake, and I only have one copy. I know they will look for any reason to reject it. I wish I would have had my case manager help me. My hands are shaking and my palms are sweaty, but I don't have the comfort of mom's spehgetti. (Sorry, I wrote out the first part of the sentence because it's true, and then I saw the joke and had to make it before anyone else did). 

I live in a one party consent state for voice recordings, and sought out some advice to make sure it would be legal for me to record my second attempt to get the correct passport tomorrow. I'm going to ask why I was given incorrect information, why I wasn't told there was the option to print one out myself, and if they realize that violated my court protected civil rights. My CM told me when he was dropping off the forms that he found out they can actually look up and print off the new forms there. So, I'm going to bring that up too. I'm going to ask if they somehow had forms that only had the female and X option, if she would tell males they had to pick one. I will then follow up asking why it was different because I'm intersex/non-binary. 

The person, also intersex nonbinary, in Colorado whose lawsuit made this possible was right. We are not men or women so we shouldn't be forced to lie on government forms. I want to be clear though that non-intersex non-binary people are EQUALLY AS VALID and also deserve the X option. It's just harder for bigots to justify their refusal against the kind of medical evidence they recognize as valid. So, I almost feel like it's my responsibility as someone who can more easily shut their arguments down, is white, and has had therapy for this to stand up for all of us. 

I'm also a scared little burnt-out mouse and hoping for some encouragement/advice here? I'm autistic and have severe social anxiety.

688,Questioning gender & would love some advice,"So I‚Äôve been wondering about my gender a lot lately and it‚Äôs come to my attention that that‚Äôs something cis people typically don‚Äôt do. But I have no idea what I am and I would really love some advice. I‚Äôm sorry this is long. 

I‚Äôm afab late 20s. I guess the root of the problem is I have masculine tendencies but I don‚Äôt know how deep they run? Like in my ideal world I would dress masculine‚ÄîI‚Äôve always loved male clothes and fashion more. Dresses and more feminine clothes make me uncomfortable almost all the time but sometimes I don‚Äôt mind them. 

Okay but also I know clothes don‚Äôt define gender. When I was a little kid way before I really had a concept of trans or anything I used to tell people that I was born a boy but my parents wanted a girl so they made me one. Whenever I would play pretend games I made my character a boy with a boy name. I grew up with lots of boy cousins and always wanted to dress like them and be a boy. I remember crying when I first started getting boobs because it meant I wouldn‚Äôt be flat chested any more. 

But as I got older idk if I just thought that was shameful or childish or what but I stopped all that and embraced being a girl more I guess? I really leaned into sisterhood and I‚Äôve got a great group of women in my life. I identify with a lot of the struggles or challenges women face and I feel like that aspect of my life along with sisterhood is a core part of me. Sometimes I feel like I identify more with being part of a sisterhood than with actually being female. I‚Äôm not sure if that makes sense. But at the same time being called a woman just feels wrong. Whenever I call myself a woman I always stumble over it because it just doesn‚Äôt fit right. I don‚Äôt mind girl or female though? Man doesn‚Äôt really feel right either though. 

But even now the version of me I see in my head looks more masculine & I have a very older brotherly vibe to myself. At the same time I want desperately to be a mom one day.

Some days I wish I could wake up with short hair and a flat chest/no curves and look like a man. Some days I love my long hair and feminine curves. In an ideal world I think I would love to be able to shape shift and choose what I look like based on the day. Ironically, ever since I was a child I always said shapeshifting was my dream superpower. 

I‚Äôm also afraid that if I‚Äôm not really a cis female, have I deceived my way into these circles of women? Are people going to see me as a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing trying to infiltrate the sisterhood somehow? I don‚Äôt know how I could cope with that. 

I really don‚Äôt know. I would love if anyone had some thoughts or feedback or ideas or ways to help me work through this. Therapy isn‚Äôt really an option right now due to cost and an extremely conservative family. If you‚Äôve read through this whole mess and have any advice or thoughts or ideas I‚Äôm open to hearing them. I wish someone could just do a scan of my brain and tell me what I really am lol. 

Please be kind, I‚Äôve put off posting this for probably a week now because I‚Äôm afraid of what people might say and that it might be hard to swallow.

698,Genderqueer - A Ramble,"Most people live in their vessels, unperturbed by them. They may have a gripe, a complaint here or there, but for some of us, it is agony. I ignore it for the most part. I know that my body will never be the one I truly want, but I can dream of it. I long for the day my body is no longer my prison. Someday, I will engage in the divine alchemy of the self. As grapes turn to wine, so shall I become something completely different. It‚Äôs already begun. I bind my chest, I cut my hair, I dress myself to reflect my soul to the world. I carry myself with all of the unearned confidence of a man and the expected kindness of a woman. I want to go further. I need to go further. I will remove everything that would remind me of the maternal destiny society wants to force upon me. No one will force my body to carry another. Some may see this as selfish. They don‚Äôt matter. No one else‚Äôs opinion matters. No one‚Äôs opinions will stop my metamorphosis. I am still nestled in my cocoon, waiting patiently. Someday, I tell myself. Someday. But that someday will come. I will rejoice as my body becomes a glorious, colorful, beautiful thing I can finally feel at peace with. The weight will be lifted from my chest, and I will be free. Some will never see me as I am. They will always insist that I am woman, that I must be a certain way by virtue of my birth. To them, I am an impossibility. I am unfathomable. I am an anomaly. I must be one or the other, pink or blue, male or female, but I reject that. Nobody will tell me what I am. Not anymore. I know what I am. I am a blanket of lavender, soft, queer, and beautiful. I am a column of white, untarnished by what society expects. I am a field of green, nurturing, androgynous, and strong. I am genderqueer.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to say to them. That‚Äôs what I wish they‚Äôd all understand. But they never will, no matter how many times I try to explain it to them. They‚Äôll tell me I‚Äôm just a tomboy. They‚Äôll tell me everyone feels this way. They‚Äôll beg me not to mutilate my body, but they have no idea. They can‚Äôt fathom what it‚Äôs like to live in the body I do every day, knowing something is off. They have no idea how badly I want to be anything but what I am. They will never understand the bitter resentment I have towards my lover, looking at his body and wishing it was mine. No one would understand the sheer horror I have when I think too hard about what my body could do if given the chance. I am alone in my understanding of myself. 

So I‚Äôll just keep all of this to myself. It‚Äôs not like the closet isn‚Äôt a familiar place. It may be dark, but at least it‚Äôs safe. I don‚Äôt have to worry about ridicule, harassment, or harm. I can just keep smiling as they call me ‚Äúher‚Äù and ‚Äúmiss‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äù and ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll ever pass as anything else anyways.

But I can see you getting some pushback for trying to use cis and trans together.

Obviously, you‚Äôre free to be yourself no matter what labels you put on it, but it does seem like you might be painting yourself into a corner where you‚Äôre constantly having to justify this particular identity', 'This is an interesting question. I think that if you said ""I am cis but fall under the trans umbrella"" this would, at best, elicit confusion or misunderstanding, and at worst, possibly cause some people to take offence, feel defensive, and/or subject you to some backlash.\n\nCis and trans are usually seen as opposites or separate, non-overlapping categories. Now, in practice, there is actually some gray area between the two states, but most ""broad umbrella"" approaches define trans to be inclusive of anyone who doesn\'t feel 100% cis 100% of the time. When you use a term like ""the trans umbrella"" you evoke the broad, inclusive definition of trans, so saying that you are ""cis"" while also fitting under a broad trans umbrella, would be confusing.\n\nI.e. being ""both cis and trans"" really only makes sense if you are sticking to older, stricter definitions of ""trans"" which are binaristic or otherwise limiting (such as transmedicalist views, only considering people trans if they hormonally transition, experience strong dysphoria, etc.)\n\nThere is good reason behind the move towards more inclusive definitions of trans. Mainly, it comes down to avoiding the whole ""not trans enough"" worry, and combatting transmedicalist ideology, which can reinforce medical gatekeeping, and can often be dismissive of if not outright hateful towards both nonbinary people, and binary trans people who do not desire medical transition.\n\nThe terms ""genderqueer"" and ""nonbinary"" are also both broadly inclusive. A lot of genderqueer and nonbinary people have identities ""adjacent to"" binary identities, which can include their assigned birth gender (i.e. someone who is ""cis adjacent"" but not fully cis) or a binary trans identity (i.e. someone whose identity is close to the opposite of their assigned birth sex, but not fully aligned with that identity.)\n\nI\'m not going to say that it\'s wrong to identify the way you describe, but I would caution you against it because I think it would probably not be the best way for you to communicate your experiences to others. Language is imperfect, can change over time, and can mean different things to different people, but I still think that communication works best when we put some effort into using terms within the range of meanings that are commonly used. If we get too far outside that meaning, people get confused, and sometimes even (understandably) lash out.\n\nMany of us have had experiences with people using terminology in nonstandard ways with ill intent...I know I have certainly encountered that, so when I see someone using terms in ways that seem contradictory or confusing, I get defensive, standoffish even. I start worrying that the person might be trolling, or pushing a weird agenda without being clear about doing so, because I\'ve seen a number of people do that. I.e. a large portion of people who use trans-related terminology in nonstandard ways are either advancing transmedicalist ideology, TERF, right-wing anti-trans ideologies, or some other problematic and harmful viewpoint. And, given that transmedicalism and TERF can be held by a number of LGBTQ people, just knowing that someone is nonbinary or genderqueer is not sufficient for me to feel ""safe"" with them using terminology in nonstandard ways. It still puts me on edge a bit.\n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts here!', 'Have you heard the term metagender before?

People associate with one term or another based on personal feelings, so exact connotations will differ for everyone.  I personally see ""genderqueer"" as a somewhat more forceful term (in a good way), one with a longer history that\'s tied to queerness as a political identity.\n\nGenderfluid generally means that a person experiences life as different genders at different times.  Could change by the day, the month, the hour, etc. Also, one can be any combination of genderfluid, genderqueer, nonbinary and queer - these terms aren\'t mutually exclusive.', 'I am queer and genderqueer and genderfluid.\n\nQueer is an easy way to say succinctly ‚ÄúI belong in the (LGBT) community‚Äù without getting into exactly who I am attracted to and what I am. My actual orientation is bisexual/pansexual, but most of the time people don‚Äôt need to know that. I‚Äôm married and monogamous and so queer keeps it simple. It would be even more necessary if I had attraction to one gender as the most common words for that refer to both your gender and your potential partners‚Äô genders. Personally I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like to try to pick between straight or gay if I happened to primarily or only like men. Thankfully I do not have to deal with that.\n\nI‚Äôm also in the camp of both reclaiming the power of the word queer, which is still used as if it‚Äôs an insult in many places I‚Äôve lived, and considering myself politically aligned with the queer liberation movement.\n\nThat led into my choice of using the word genderqueer to describe myself once I understood that I was trans and not binary. It was an obvious choice, since genderqueer was the dominant word for ‚Äúoutside man or woman‚Äù, but it also aligned with my politics and my feeling that gender is a massive mess and I‚Äôd like to fuck it up if I may, please and thanks. I may use the word nonbinary now, but that‚Äôs primarily for convenience, it‚Äôs more common and seen as less clinical than it was 15 years ago or so. Nonbinary always felt like the technical, polite word. Almost like ‚Äúfemale is to woman as nonbinary is to genderqueer‚Äù without the added connotation of choosing to call women females and men males. It‚Äôs not the same as sex vs gender but it had a similar detachment in language that it no longer has.\n\nAnd genderfluid comes from the fact that as I understand it my gender changes over time. Genderfluid is under the nonbinary umbrella, it‚Äôs one way in which we can categorize gender experiences. There‚Äôs fluidity where what the gender (or lack of gender) is changes, fluctuation (genderflux) where the strength of experience of gender changes, having a gender at all (agender vs ambivalent (to) gender vs gendered), how many genders experienced (single gender, bigender, multigender, pangender, omnigender), and other more complex parameters that can all be defined separately. Understanding that gender is a feature which has many distinct descriptors helps people understand why there are so many gender labels out there. Once you try to describe gender without just pointing to a group of other people and saying ‚Äúthat‚Äù/‚Äúnot that‚Äù, in order to be understood you have to have a common language, and the more we discuss amongst each other the more we find ways we are different or similar and therefore need to describe those differences and similarities.\n\nTLDR: queer is a word for orientation, genderqueer is a similar concept to nonbinary, genderfluid is a change in gender over time, and you can be any combination including all three.', ""It's worth pointing out that there are two meanings of genderqueer in use today:\n\nThe original term genderqueer, as attested by Riki Wilchins in the 1990s, was a political rallying call for anyone that lived outside the traditional binary notions of gender  whether in terms of identity or expression.

I often wished my chest was smaller so it would be easier to pass as one.  I'm not sure if I want to be a guy full time, I kinda wish I could switch back and forth.  I put on more masc pants to go out the other day and my whole attitude changed and I felt way more confident.  I really wanted to be able to chat with others and read others experiences in hopes of better navigating this journey. I don't have labels for things yet.

710,How do you define identity?,"I‚Äôve been thinking about identity and what can be considered valid as sexual orientation and identity. I‚Äôm an empath. A strong one at that. So I constantly feel everyone else‚Äôs emotions and identity all the time. In a perpetual state of filtering and mirroring, i feel everyone‚Äôs different sexuality and identity. Can I be classified as queer if my identity is a projection of others identity overlapping with my own? But what I feel is genuine. It‚Äôs been like this for so long that I feel almost no sense of my own identity. At times I feel male, straight, gay, female, ace, lesbian, etc. most of the time I just feel so different from everyone else around me as my identity is constantly adapting in the presence of others. I can resist it but what do I fall back on? With the attraction I feel being genuine how can I tell what is my own versus others? Or is this all just an excuse to describe my own emotional identity being unstable due to fluidity?

711,Exploring existential questions,"So here I am at 41 years old, amab, and having newly come to the realization that I am genderqueer, and therefore am facing some interesting existential questions.

I've been doing some writing and LOTS of reading the past two weeks to try and sort this all out in my head. Someone shared their story a couple weeks ago and reading it made a deep and profound impact on how I understand myself. So I wanted to share mine here, in the hopes that maybe it'll help someone else think about themselves... and also because it's cathartic.

**How did I get here?**

Well ‚Ä¶ quite by accident, I think. I always recalled my childhood as being rather unremarkable. The way I remembered it, I was a happy kid, quiet, did my own thing, and kept to myself. And honestly, I never put any effort into thinking any more about it. I escaped my childhood ‚Äî I have no friends from before college (off facebook, anyway) ‚Äî so my childhood memories could stay safely locked away, undisturbed.

Then early last week, a friend from years ago made a post on social media about their gender identity. Reading their story of being othered in childhood, the bullying, the never-belonging ‚Ä¶ it brought it all back. Like a flood gate, these unlocked memories came rushing in.

The truth is that I have never fit in. When I was little in the 80s, I never knew how to fit in with the boys. I couldn‚Äôt figure them out, and being around them made me uncomfortable. Because of that, I was relentlessly labelled as a faggot and a queer. The girls made sense to me though. I liked the things they liked, I wanted to do the things they did, and they were nice to me. So I made friends with them and became one of the girls. I didn‚Äôt think I was a girl, I just felt I belonged with them. I was safe, and comfortable there, two things I never was among the boys.

So all these memories of the first 20 tortured years of my life came flooding back‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs when it hit me: I never fit in with them, because I‚Äôm *not one of them.*

And so down the rabbit hole I went.

**If I‚Äôm not a ‚ÄúGuy,‚Äù what am I?**

*I‚Äôm not one of them ‚Ä¶* what a gloriously freeing thought. But what am I? Well ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs start with the other things that I am not.

I am not misgendered. I feel totally connected with the body I‚Äôm in, and have no issues being male.

I am not agender. There are some very masculine parts of my identity, and some very feminine parts of my identity and I connect with both parts equally.

I am not genderfluid. I don‚Äôt feel like a man sometimes and like a woman others. The masculine and feminine aspects of my identity feel in balance, not alternating.

That leaves me with genderqueer ‚Ä¶ and oh, there‚Äôs that word again. ‚ÄúQueer.‚Äù Except now it somehow feels like a badge of honor rather than the scarlett letter I wore as a child. This must be me. I‚Äôm genderqueer.

**What Makes me ‚ÄúNot a Guy?‚Äù**

If men are from Mars and women are from Venus ‚Ä¶ well I‚Äôm from Neptune. I look like a martian and tried to blend in, but could never escape the fact that it‚Äôs just not where I‚Äôm from.

I find it offputting to be called a man. I spent a lot of time recently trying to explore what it is about that I don‚Äôt like. What is it -- to me -- that makes a man and man and a woman a woman?

If I take genotypes and phenotypes off the table and focus only on observable behaviours, I could score people individually on empathy, aggression, kindness, competitiveness, and other characteristics. If I had to make binary piles to sort out Man and Woman, I suppose I would sort those with higher empathy and kindness, and lower aggression and competitiveness, into the ""Woman"" pile, and the opposite ‚Äî low empathy/kindness, high aggression/competitiveness ‚Äî into the ‚ÄúMan‚Äù pile.

There it is ‚Ä¶ toxic masculinity. Why is that how I view ‚Äúmen‚Äù? I can be a man and just not be toxic. So why not be that?

But then I look at my friends. Out of necessity in my adult life I developed a few close male friendships. Three carefully curated men whom I care about a great deal. They‚Äôre my closest friends in the world, and I‚Äôd trust each of them with my life. They don‚Äôt exhibit toxic masulinity ‚Ä¶ and yet I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the same as them. Not better, not worse. Just somehow not the same. Honestly this is where I get stuck.

It just comes back to down to Mars, Venus, and Neptune. Not all martians are the same, and some martians are in fact very relatable. But wether I get along with some, or even all, of them ‚Äî it‚Äôs just not where I‚Äôm from. I‚Äôm not one of them.

**So ‚Ä¶ What Am I?**

Well. I‚Äôm me. And I like that.

In my early 20‚Äôs I stopped trying to figure out how to fit in, and began drinking instead. That‚Äôs a whole other story - but I‚Äôm 5 years sober now. While I was drinking, I never had to think about fitting in or figuring out where I belonged. I was too numb to care that I didn‚Äôt belong, and that was good enough for a while. When I got sober, I found that I ‚Äúbelonged‚Äù and fit in with AA. These were my people. I came to understand my inability to fit in as a side effect of being an alcoholic‚Ä¶ and so I didn‚Äôt have to think any further about it.

But then the floodgates opened. The memories of childhood came racing back. I got hit with that ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment of realization that I‚Äôm not one of them. I was forced to take a second (third? fourth?) look. And that‚Äôs when it ALL made sense. ALL of it.

I was born genderqueer, not a boy. I was raised as a boy, and could never find my place. I came of age attempting to become a man, and felt nothing but awkward and out of place. I entered adulthood pretending to be a man, and despite great superficial successes (and several spectacular failures), NEVER found my place. I spent most of my adult life drinking to avoid the pain of having to pretend to be something I wasn‚Äôt. But now, with this incredibly simple statement ‚Äî ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not one of them*‚Äù ‚Äî I can look back all the way to my earliest memories, and EVERYTHING makes sense.

So. Here I am. I have many strong masculine qualities. I have many strong feminine qualities. I have a male body and my gender expression leans towards the masculine side.

I‚Äôm me, take it or leave it.",twrn5v,35,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/twrn5v/exploring_existential_questions/,"['Beautiful story.

713,A question about self labelling and navigating an existing relationship,"So I came out to my wife a few days ago as ""some sort of nonbinary trans"", a label I don't identify with entirely and don't expect to be a stable end point of wherever my journey might be heading. But saying nothing out loud had become unsustainable. 

We have had discussions and full on crying fights over my outward presentation over the last six months, so I think she was less surprised than overwhelmed by being told with certainty that my previously rather cis persona is dead and buried.

My question is whether or not I'm setting myself and my marriage up for worse future problems by the way I approached this. She asked me a series of questions from 'are you changing your pronouns' to 'are you going to do hrt' and everything in between and I answered partially truthfully and partially evasively that I don't really have answers to any of that just yet.

From anyone else with a similar experience, am I creating future problems for my relationship by (1) adopting labelling that I don't entirely agree with in an attempt to give her something more concrete to latch onto even though I expect that to evolve? (2) not laying out right upfront the fact that I'm seriously contemplating hrt at a future point even though I'm not certain about how that will shake out in my own mind?

I don't want to be hiding the ball (Jesus, that's an unfortunate turn of phrase) but I also don't want to get out ahead of myself. I also don't want to burn my credibility by changing her expectations too far, too frequently, or too often.

Yes, I know that therapy of some sort is the proper venue for these questions, but I haven't gotten there yet. I will. I was just hoping to find someone who has navigated this space, whether successfully or not, to hear about pitfalls or positives I'm not thinking of myself.",tw4yye,19,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/tw4yye/a_question_about_self_labelling_and_navigating_an/,"[""So I am in a ridiculously similar position, albeit with a fiancee instead of wife - I've been in personal gender therapy for a while now, and still don't have any definitive answers about myself either, except that I'm definitely not the cis male I thought I was.\n\nI'm working on finding us a couples therapist that deals with this stuff as well, As I've been dealing with these feelings for about a year now, and feel like I've made little to no progress, and I think some of that stems from feeling anxious about what my SO thinks, and I struggle a bit with the conversations around it, as again, I feel like I have no answers to anything she asks.\n\nAs to your questions - I've internally had the same ones floating around and have come up with:\n\n1.

There's no deadline or statute of limitations on figuring yourself out or making various transition-related decisions. It's okay to not have everything figured out yet, and it's unreasonable to expect you to have decided everything at this point.\n\nIf she's not comfortable with you not having this figured out, that's on her, not you. Your work is to figure it out as best you can in your own time. Her work is to deal with her own internalized misconceptions about gender and your identity, get whatever support she needs *somewhere else,* and provides you the support you need while you're doing the hard thing. Her desire to have a concrete understanding of the situation is understandable, but very little in life is certain, and expecting that of you is unreasonable even if you were cis.\n\nGet her plugged into a support group like PFLAG, and get you and possibly her some gender therapy. Communicate to her that you aren't certain, and that you appreciate her patience while you work through what your experience of gender means to you, how you want to describe it, and what steps you might take in your life to be more comfortable. Communication is key in any relationship, but especially in gender-diverse ones."", 'I have no advice for how to proceed, but the whole evolving labeling thing really stuck with me.

Instead of trying to present her with a nice, easy to handle idea, you might want to just spend a lot more time processing your feelings with her. Just talking through your thoughts with her frequently will make whatever happens much easier than if you try to predict how you will feel a month from now and give her some kind of summary based on a guess. She will be more likely to see things coming if you mention when it comes into your head that you are considering hormones or whatever, or if the two of you talk about the pros and cons of hormones. You could do something like one or twice a week go for a walk or a drive with her and talk about how you feel or write her a letter every day. I love hearing my husband's thoughts.

I am gender fluid myself, for me it's cause my gender/body dysphoria comes and goes.

I'm just really confused cause without the stereotypes and gender roles we're all the same , there is no difference except for genetelia, so if someone identifies as non binary , how can someone ""feel like neither a man or a woman'' when feeling like a certain gender doesn't exist , or does it ?",tvyzos,6,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/tvyzos/what_exactly_is_non_non_binary_and_how_can/,"[""Well, gender is a social construct and that plays into the gender roles you speak of.

Feeling like a certain gender very much exists, even if you feel like it's not something you experience."", 'dysphoria is a push that pushes you out of a certain gender. euphoria is the pull that pulls you towards one. if trans people have to be dysphoric about our agabs, then it would only be fair that cis people should have to be certain they *would* be dysphoric about every other gender in existence for their cisness to be valid. \n\nnonbinary is an umbrella term that refers to anyone who isn\'t 100% solely and constantly one of the two binary genders\n\ngenders exist just like sandwiches exist. you *know* what a ""woman"" is, even if you couldn\'t create a logically complete proof for what a woman is. ones gender is our sense of self with relation to the gendered world around us. so a woman looks at womanhood, aware of butch women and nonwestern womanhood and says, ""yeah, I fit here, this is comfortable and good for me""', 'Personally I\'ve come to this conclusion for now;\nEveryone can feel and be feminine/masculine/both/neither in one way or another, regardless of what body they were born with. \n\nThe reason I think people ""feel"" like a certain gender is often (not always) based on if they feel like they fit into a gender-based stereotype or not. \n\nIm AFAB and used to think that I was non-binary, because I felt uncomfortable with female stereotypes and didn\'t identify as a man either. Later I\'ve realized I\'m not nonbinary because the uncomfortable feelings were rooted in sexism and the want for escaping them. I thought that if I identified and lived as a non-binary person I could escape sexism.\n\nNow I try to live as my authentic self and believe that how I dress or act doesn\'t Have to be linked to gender. Just because you\'re born AFAB you don\'t have to be feminine. And just because you\'re AFAB and don\'t feel comfortable with being feminine it doesn\'t automatically mean you\'re trans/genderqueer. Now I identify with agender or gender non-comforming because I don\'t feel or identify with any gender. The only thing I know is I got specific body parts, and I don\'t think they need to define my personality that much. I only think they\'re relevant in some situations, like if you need to go to the doctor.\n\nI hope that makes sense, and I hope it doesn\'t come off as transphobic because this is only my personal experience and thoughts. And I know that it could\'ve helped me to hear this when I was younger.', 'I can tell you only about my own, agender, experience. Probably ""allogender"" people, and even other agender people, will have very different feelings from mine. Because we all experience gender differently and interact with it differently.\n\nSo, I\'m agender, genderless and I know it, because I know what is gender. I have it in my head. And I know that I\'m not that. If I try it on me, I feel dysphoric (it\'s probably called mental dysphoria) Also (since I\'m not fully genderless) I see where I intersect with gender (and which one). I... I feel it. I feel which part of my consciousness is genderless and which have some ""gendered presence"" / ""vibe"" at the moment.\n\nMy body doesn\'t participate in that process because I don\'t see gender in my body. My body can be anything and represent anything for me. I see it kinda... blank. I can interpret in variety of ways.', 'I am most likely agender. However, my impression is that some people actually have feelings that correspond to what others would consider ""masculine"" or ""feminine"". For example, when I walk, I tend to move my shoulders rather than my hips. This type of movement seems to be more common among men rather than women. I think I do it less because it makes me feel more like a man and more because it makes me feel like Geralt of Rivia, which I think is funny. Probably, people who feel like men would walk this way and think, ""Yeah, this makes me feel like a man."" or ""Yeah, this feels right.""\n\nIn general, women are softer to the touch than men (IMO). Perhaps if someone wears something delicate and has soft, smooth skin, then they feel feminine. I generally think, ""Huh. How about that?"" in that situation, but I\'m guessing that people who feel like women feel that this is more who they are.\n\nI don\'t have dysphoria or euphoria (I\'m generally pretty anhedonic), so I can\'t comment on that part. I can tell that I feel outside the binary gender scheme, because when I think ""fuck gender and all the ideas that go with it"", I feel that this is correct. Likewise, I don\'t care at all about the label on my meat sack. However, I also know that there are people who struggle to have their gender-related feelings accepted. Their feelings are no less valid than my feelings. Even if I don\'t feel it, I still respect and accept that others do.', 'Trans is not defined on an axis of suffering.']"
716,"We have a new ::free:: online live support group for LGBTQ+ survivors of abuse and sexual trauma, and I'm here to welcome anyone who needs inclusive, non-judgmental support.","\[Mod approved\]

Hello beautiful humans,

I work with a 100% volunteer-run 501(c)3 non-profit offering free online (Zoom) support groups for survivors of abuse and sexual trauma. We run 75+ weekly groups and monthly workshops, and now we're launching an LGBTQ+ support group in addition to those.

We are a very inclusive community, with both survivors and volunteers of all different ages, genders (cis and non-conforming), backgrounds, ages, cultures, religions (or lack thereof), races, and identities. What we don't have is a space created just for the LGBTQ+ community, and we would like to change that.

I would love to extend an invitation to this community to join the new support group(s) (up to 3 different days/times depending on how many volunteers we get). This also extends to any other of our other mixed-gender support groups or workshops as well.

We would also love to welcome genderqueer individuals to run these groups, both due to representation as well as (for some) your understanding of trauma just from social stigma and hurtful experiences, let alone whatever else you may have gone through in your life.

I'm posting here to spread awareness of free, accessible support for those who are having a hard time going it alone (groups will launch in about 3-4 weeks). The Hope Recovery community is one where we uplift and hold one another, and make sure every single person feels seen and validated. Nobody will ever tell you it never happened, or that you're making a big deal out of nothing. You're not alone and you deserve support. There will never be any fees and you'll never be told you've been here too long or someone else needs your spot. It can be scary to meet new people, but these are other humans who actually get it, because they're going through the same things. Finding support is an important step in healing, and I'm happy to open our community to yours.

Please go here to see a full list of our program offerings (details are lower on the page, though not everything is running at this time): [https://www.hope4-recovery.org/program.html](https://www.hope4-recovery.org/program.html)

The post is also an ask for people to volunteer to run the new groups as well, as we are building this from scratch. We also need volunteers in general as we have all types of people in our program at large, and representation breeds safety. 

I appreciate your time in reading this-- take care and be well :) Brandi

p.s. It is a religious non-profit but all groups bar one are secular, as we are inclusive of all beliefs.",tvf0y0,39,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/tvf0y0/we_have_a_new_free_online_live_support_group_for/,[]

I am 41, AMAB, and only now have begun to realize that I do not identify as a ‚Äúman.‚Äù 

I never fit in with the boys when I was a kid, so all my friends were girls, and I considered myself ‚Äúone of the girls.‚Äù As we grew up, the fact that I‚Äôm not a girl put me on the outside of those social circles as well. Entering adulthood it became apparent that my platonic relationships with women were causing lots of jealousy in my monogamous hetero relationships ‚Ä¶ so now at 41, I have 3 carefully curated close male friends, and my wife and daughter. That‚Äôs my whole life. 

In my friend group, I still feel very much on the outskirts. I am not ‚Äúone of them‚Äù (though they never treat me like I‚Äôm not). At home, at least, I can still be one of the girls‚Ä¶ but my daughter keeps reminding me that I‚Äôm a boy, lol. I don‚Äôt mind when she tells me I‚Äôm not a girl, but being called a boy ‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt sit well. 

I am not misgenered, but I do not feel like ‚Äúa guy,‚Äù so I am not sure what I am‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs how I wound up here at genderqueer. I don‚Äôt feel any real need to have a label other than for the benefit of being able to succinctly describe myself in fewer than 3 paragraphs ‚Äî but that‚Äôs still the problem: ‚ÄúGenderqueer‚Äù says what I am not, but does not help pin down what I am; and ‚ÄúPredominantly heterosexual genderqueer male‚Äù seems like a mouth full!

But more than finding a label, I came here in hopes of finding a place to belong. I‚Äôm not one of the guys, and I don‚Äôt get to be one of the girls; quite ironically I never allowed myself to try to belong in the LGBTQIAA+ community (because I felt outside of that, too)‚Ä¶ so, I‚Äôm here to say hi and find out if I‚Äôm finally in a place where I‚Äôll fit in.",tvoddw,12,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/tvoddw/figuring_out_where_i_fit_in/,"['Hi there, I hope you end up finding that this is a place you fit in, because we‚Äôd certainly love to have you!

I've learned to respect that it is there to protect me.\n\nIt is painful to balance my safety against my self expression.

Are you afraid of someone finding them, or are you afraid of the process of buying them? Do you have someone who can support you in buying them?\n\nMy psychologist says that if I give in to my anxiety, then it reinforces that I really do need to be afraid of that thing. For example, if I am anxious about talking to the people at the bank, and I just refuse to go to the bank, then I feel relief when I don't have to go. My brain thinks it has protected me with that anxiety. If I do go, it is obviously going to be fine, because the people at the bank are pretty nice.

My gender definitely reaches outside of the gender binary, but I still mainly use the word male as the main label for my identity.

Practically, it also implies a few things that aren't true about my gender and experience. So what are your people's thoughts?

728,Confused/naive person looking to learn more about the discussions surrounding gender,"I‚Äôm not sure if I have come to the right place to ask this. However, as the title suggest, I have a lot of questions regarding gender and the way people identify themselves within the world. There is a lot of discussion and conflict surrounding this topic and I would to learn more about it.

All I know is this: I don‚Äôt even know what it is that I don‚Äôt know, but, I feel like I must be missing something.

I read an argument today in the comments section of a tiktok video. 

It started as Person 1 referred to Person 2 as a girl.

Person 2 corrected Person 1 and indicated that they were not a girl.

Person 1 then noted that Person 2 had indicated on their profile that they use she/her pronouns.

Person 2 then stated ‚Äùpronouns ‚â† gender‚Äù

Person 1 then responded with ‚ÄúAh, so you are non binary. Apologies for the confusion‚Äù

Person 2 further corrected Person 1 saying that they are not non-binary. A heated argument ensued.

I was left extremely confused.

I don‚Äôt understand how somebody can refer to themselves as she/her yet not be a girl.

This is a very specific example, but I am using it to illustrate the following point:

I don‚Äôt understand a lot of the discussions surrounding gender identities. However, I would like to.

I feel intimidated by such discussions as they feel taboo, so I, like many others, avoid them. But, I think this is wrong and I worry about having prejudices as a consequence of my ignorance. I feel a responsibility to learn.

However, I should note that this is not my only motivation - I am also just genuinely really curious and interested.

So, I would really appreciate it if somebody could point me in the right direction of where to start. Perhaps an established gender studies book? Or if there is something more fundamental then I could start there - I really want to understand the fundamental definitions and ideas etc.

I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have an issue with it, but while I have no issues with he/him pronouns, after all I certainly look male I realized I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever thought to define my own pronouns and putting he/him didn‚Äôt feel right, it made me very nervous or anxious. So I‚Äôve been really spending some time thinking about myself and my gender. I haven‚Äôt really thought about this at this level in like 20 years. It‚Äôs been like a splinter in my thoughts since. I think for me the most confusing part is I‚Äôm likely a little older than most here and I remember when I was younger really admiring and feeling envious of comedian Eddie Izzard and feeling like I wish I could be just like Nathan Lane in the birdcage or feeling really confused watching In and out. These feelings really made me wonder if I was gay (there is such a spectrum now but back in the 90s it didn‚Äôt seem that way) but I‚Äôm not attracted to masculinity so that was out. I felt like I matched so much of what it was to be gay except the liking guys part which is really the part that makes you gay. Anyway I‚Äôve always been kinda feminine but I have a real fear of presenting too feminine yet I really wish I was brave enough to dress even more femme.

732,I don't understand my gender. Help!,"Hey everyone! I've been struggling to understand my gender identity, and I was looking for some advice as to if anyone has felt similar confusion to mine and what they may have discovered for themselves.

I've been trying to understand if I'm cis, nonbinary, or even trans. I'm AFAB and identify right now as a bisexual woman. But lately I've been thinking a lot about my gender identity and I can‚Äôt understand if I‚Äôm an indifferent cis woman who‚Äôs projecting or not. I feel like I‚Äôve convinced myself of things before as an internal way to be unique. But to be fair, I thought I convinced myself I was bisexual in 8th grade, and I‚Äôve been in a relationship with a girl for two years now so‚Ä¶I guess I really was bisexual.

I‚Äôve always felt very indifferent about gender I think, and I just accept the way things are because it‚Äôll never be anything different. 

But at the same time, I feel like I wish I was someone else. I‚Äôm a maladaptive daydreamer, and a writer, and I‚Äôve only ever been able to write/create male characters. As a kid, all of my stuffed animals were boys. In middle school, I wanted to create a male alter ego of myself. But to be fair, this could all be internal misogyny or my attraction to men manifesting in weird ways.

I hate being called a lady or a woman, although I‚Äôm fine with a lot of feminine terms. I‚Äôve comfortably grown up with being the tomboy girl that‚Äôs referred to as a ‚Äúboy‚Äù or ‚Äúson‚Äù or ‚Äúnephew‚Äù as a weird family joke. My girlfriend calls me something lately, a pet name that has the word boy in it, and it makes me so happy. 

But when I think about pronouns, I get especially confused. I‚Äôve always used she/her, and despite being more hyper aware of it, I‚Äôm fine with them. No one has ever used anything else for me but I like the idea of they/them. She/they then? They/she? It feels weirdly empty without also saying he/him, like I‚Äôm just missing exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. But I wouldn‚Äôt want just he/him, I‚Äôm okay with she/her and they/them. But sometimes I‚Äôm itching for a certain set, they/he or they/them, like I‚Äôm just standing in the shower thinking about how great it‚Äôd feel to have a pronoun pin with THIS SPECIFIC SET of pronouns at this moment. If that makes sense. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I experience gender dysphoria, but lately I‚Äôve been feeling bad about my body. I especially feel shitty about my height (5‚Äô2) because I wish I could at least appear androgynously if I wanted to. I wish I could cut my hair and it would look less like ‚Äúpixie girl‚Äù and more like ‚Äúshaggy boy‚Äù. I even feel gross about my reproductive organs‚ÄîI know that‚Äôs random, but it feels wrong having them in there. I bought a gc2b binder a few months ago to see how it made me feel but I couldn‚Äôt even get any results because I got it too big by accident. 

But feeling like I want to look like this doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm nb or trans‚Äîmy brain could be wanting to copy what I see on TikTok or something. There‚Äôs no way to trust, no matter what I feel or think I want, that I‚Äôm not cis because it could all be me projecting or copying and I won‚Äôt know until I decide I am and create social issues trying to come out. 

But despite all of this, I am as girl as girl can be. Everything I have is pink, I‚Äôm short, my voice is high pitched, I‚Äôm always the baby spoon, I stand with my hip out, I cross my legs, like I literally act and appear as feminine as possible naturally. And I could never appear as anything other than a woman.

It feels wrong to be cis, but wrong to be anything but. I like the idea of being nonbinary but I don‚Äôt know if I actually am or I‚Äôm just being miserable about myself, and I feel attached to ‚Äúmale‚Äù terms and identities but feel like that‚Äôs just some weird internalization.

738,"ADVICE NEEDED: Cis het man dating afab nb, trying to affirm their identity and make them feel comfortable","How do I affirm my partner's gender identity as a cis het man? My partner is nb afab and I want to create a space for them in our relationship where they feel comfortable to be who they really are. But they say that they feel like they need to perform femininity for me, the same way they do out in the world. What can I do, as someone who is attracted to femininity, to make them feel comfortable not being feminine?

I'm also afraid that after I make them comfortable being less feminine, I might become less attracted to them. Like my brain may be more woke than my dick. I'm terrified that I may lose my attraction for them if, after they explore for a while, they end up with a more androgynous or masculine center.

For me personally I love that my bf and I call each other dude and bro, and he also calls me his emby (our personal version of enby).\n\nI'd suggest asking your partner what kind of language they prefer to be used for them, ex. I don't mind being called girlfriend, and often talk about about being a they/them gf or an enby gf.

This is where your heterosexual label comes into play: it is important to know and acknowledge that you are in a queer relationship with a queer person. While you don't necessarily need to change your own label, it can be super helpful to express and remind your partner that you love them as a nonbinary person. They may feel as if your label means you see them as a woman, so i think sitting down and communicating will be best. Show openness and willingness to understand their identity. Reminders and sweet compliments using more enby-focused terms and the like can be a great way to show your partner you see them as nonbinary. It's also okay to look at your own labels and explore what they mean to you.\n\nIn terms of losing attraction, you can't really predict or prevent that from happening.

740,Any ideas for labels that would describe this?,"Heya! So, this isn't too important, but making this post has been on my mind for a while, so I decided to do it. Basically, one of the things that I have been wanting is a more specific label for my gender. The way I eventually came to start calling myself gender queer was because of the broadness of the term, and I was ""Just gonna use this till I figure myself out more."" Cut to now, and I've absolutely fallen in love with the term, mostly because of how broad it is, and I've been 100% satisfied with it for the longest time. But I've been thinking about something more specific again recently, and I think I would enjoy it. My idea is to describe my gender here and see if anyone knows of any gender identities that they think might match it? Or just share their thoughts on this situation as a whole. 

Okay, so anyway, one of the ways I like to describe my gender is in the framework of that semi-wellknown analogy. The idea that gender is really complicated, so we as a society made boxes around these genders in order to help us define them. Transphobia is when people try to enforce these boxes without realizing that they are there to serve the people, not the other way around - and that it's ok if our genders don't fit neatly in these boxes or even if we make our own. The way I would see my own gender is that it occupies the same space that a cis person's male gender would, but it's a different color. So it's wholly and completely male, but it is still inherently different and unique.

Sorry if I got kind of philosophical, haha. But that is the best way I've found to describe my gender so far. There is another definition I have that I feel coexists with this.

""My gender is whatever parts of myself that I can close my eyes, think about, and smile.""

Cisgender people, for example, don't have to fear mockery and ridicule when leaving the house each day for not adhering to binary gender stereotypes, they don't have to worry about the conundrum of which public restroom to use so as not to be beaten up or yelled at, they don't have to jump through hurdles of correcting people about their name and pronouns, they don't have to struggle to find clothes that fit their body type since mainstream fashion encourages gender normativity, they aren't told to ""think of the children"" by parents who insist their gender expression poses a danger to little kids, they don't have to routinely second guess the meaning and significance of cisnormativity in every aspect of their personal life, they don't run the risk of being disowned by their family or fired from their job or refused service by a business for subverting the conventions of manhood or womanhood, everyone they encounter on the street, at the store, at school, and in the workplace looks and acts virtually the same way they do, and everytime they turn on the TV or a movie or a music video or open a magazine or book they see people that also look and act much like they do to remind them that how they are is 100% normal and accepted everywhere.

749,Considering myself as genderfluid but keeping my she/her pronouns?,"My relationship to my gender confuses me. I'm an AFAB lesbian and considered to be quite femme. However, I felt a bit uncomfortable about being a woman since puberty, and by 'a bit' I mean I sometimes I'd have gender dysphoria but most of the time I'd be fine. 

I still get gender dysphoria but it's so rare and mild that even though I've considered transitioning, I don't think it would be the right decision for me. 

I considered myself genderfluid before I had heard of the label, I just used to explain it as 'sometimes I feel more like a man, sometimes more like a woman, sometimes neither' and I've felt like this my whole life. 

Defining myself as genderfluid takes away the feeling of dysphoria, makes me a bit more relaxed, I don't feel trapped in either box, I feel like I can just do whatever I want whenever I want. I know you can no matter your gender but idk it's just liberating for me. 

However, I really like my she/her pronouns, I wouldn't want to change them. It's weird because I don't really do anything different to a typical cis woman so it makes me feel like a fraud, and when I tell people I'm genderfluid they seem confused.

You need some degree of flare out. I also like skirts that flare out because it can create the illusion of hips, giving a more feminine form.

Elastic waistbands are your friend, A-line or skater silhouettes are a great starting point because they're very easy to style and work on most body shapes, plus if you have anything you wanna conceal down there they don't cling. My favorite thing is wearing a little pleated/skater skirt under a big baggy shirt or sweater.\nThe other cool thing about skirts is that the waistlines are easier to adjust than pants, so if you get a size too big it's easier to take in. I've never gotten clothes from Etsy other than graphic tees, honestly it kind of scares me. As much as I disagree with the fast fashion thing, Shein is a good starting place when you're trying something new out and aren't sure.

761,How do I experiment with gender secretly from my parents?,"I recently started feeling unsure of my current gender identity (cis female) and decided I want to experiment with it. However there is an obstacle - my parents. They are quite (but not extremely) queerphobic. While I do think crossdressing is an option, everything else is out of my reach.

762,How are we amplifying gender construction,"So we mostly agree that gender is a social construct right? But where do we draw the line exactly?

An internal experience of being.

And it\'s going to take some more determined shattering of ideals to break that particular habit. \n\nSome have seen the quick solution to this as ""let\'s abolish gender"", but these tend to have it in their heads that all dysphoria is social and not physical or emotional. Gender is much more complex and convoluted than social expression, it is an inescapable feeling of who/what a person is to themselves. Discarding it doesn\'t alleviate the inner turmoil, understanding does.\n\nWe label and categorize things as a means of understanding where they come from, what they are, how we define them. It\'s a tool for learning. Defining them as tightly to the smallest niche as possible for the greatest amount of comprehension. It\'s an affect of having the brain structure and power that we do: we were built to ask questions, seek answers, and make sense of everything (nature abhors a vacuum). And it\'s perfectly healthy to do this. It can get unhealthy when we get hung up on a label to the point of tacking it to other people whether they\'re keen on it or not.\n\nThere\'s a difference between being society\'s definition of a man and being your own definition of a man. If the details happen to overlap, that\'s not a bad thing. Society\'s idea is a collection of information that\'s a bit over-generalized, but there\'s basis in some truths. \n\nI believe in shaking off the idea that all men have to present a certain way to be men. That the idea of binary, concrete roles and rules needs to be tossed out to make room for just how fluid, abstract and individual the gender identity experience really is. It feels different from person to person, and that\'s healthy.\n\nMaybe I\'m just rambling or ranting...']"

Here are a list of surprises:
When I showed up with my masc haircut,,, my therapist cried‚Ä¶ Darn them for knowing what I don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm surprised that as I‚Äôve presented male that I'm physically attracted to my partner- or people. I thought I was ace‚Ä¶ I love my partner, he's good and we are a good team. Idk what this means.

The ease others now show around me: example my boss when I showed up at work as a man: ""I had no idea you were THIS male/androgenous, I‚Äôve always thought of you as‚Ä¶ a Dude and a woman at the same time. BUT you can just stop being a woman in people‚Äôs heads?!""

People switched to he/him pronouns out of nowhere and ask me if I‚Äôm he/him- My brain broke when I was asked the 1st time- I stared into space for a good 5 minutes.

Before I started presenting differently- my girl friends tell me the same thing: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like my husband, only you look like a woman, talking to you I get insight into what‚Äôs going on in his head. If he ever dies we are getting married.‚Äù I NEVER thought about this beyond ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs interesting, and macabre, glad to help?‚Äù The surprise? *oh, doofus, that makes sense.*

771,need perspective from other fem presenting transmasc folks,"I'm gonna try to sum this up as succinctly as possible but it's still probably going to be long. I'm 23, I've been out as trans for almost a decade now. Originally I identified as a trans man but after a few years I realized I was so focused on passing that I had totally suppressed my actual style and personality. So I went off T, met new people ans told them to use whatever pronouns they wanted for me, started exploring wearing whatever clothes I wanted, learned how to do makeup, got over my fear of pink, kind of jumped back and forth between genderfluid and agender and transmasc before finally stopping where I am now, which is that I'm just a trans man who wants to be pretty and wear whatever the fuck I want. I shaved my head and I'm growing it out long. I'm going back on T. I'm doubling down on he/him pronouns. 
But there's still something that feels off, and I think it's just the idea of not feeling like I belong anywhere, or being scared that if I don't lose a ton of weight and have my voice drop 10 octaves wearing what I want and having long hair is going to result in me never getting gendered correctly. I just want to be a beautiful boy. I don't mind being mistaken for a girl sometimes, that happens to pretty boys all the time. I'm just worried about nobody ever thinking twice about it.

Before I was honest with myself about my gender I often wore baggy/shapeless clothes when I was having a masc day, now I'm letting myself embrace those times more and I want to be proud of how I look in more masc styles, I know it kind of defeats the purpose to assign gender to styles of clothing but I'm hoping you guys know what I mean, like styles that would /generally/ be perceived as masculine. Anyways I'm going to order a binder soon I think (as soon as my next paycheck comes in) so any tips for what clothes work well with a binder are also welcome. Also!!

It\'s obviously harder to do when the weather gets warmer, but even just a tshirt under a button up can look really cool while making you look more straight up and down.\n\nI think generally avoid the temptation to just go or sizes that are way too big for you, because even though it feels like you can hide yourself that way, it doesn\'t always look that great. It\'s generally good to pair big with small. So if you\'re wearing big baggy trousers, don\'t also wear a big baggy top, and vice versa.

778,Need advice - AMAB and confused,"Hi all, Lovely to see such a supportive and encouraging community here.

I was hoping to get some advice as I have been struggling lately. I am having quite a bit of distress about being AMAB but knowing that my body, sexuality, and presentation or self-identity do not match.

As a background, I am AMAB, currently identifying as male and sexually as Predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual. I am married to a woman, I love dearly and is my life partner. I am a dad to one kid and have another on the way (and probably want more with my wife).

I recently was convinced that I was Trans and actively sought some help, starting next week. I sought this help as I could not reconcile my feelings about my gender, sexual orientation and (self-diagnosed) pretty severe body dysphoria. 

Since asking for help, I have been doing a lot of deep thinking and identifying who I am and what I want. Previously I had struggled with the concept of going from my current presenting gender (tall, broad, very masculine appearance) to a more feminine appearance and adopting the associated dictated behaviours expected by society on female-identifying people. It had left me feeling more in distress at the idea of then trying to meet a feminine prescribed ideal. 

This morning it hit me like a lightning bolt that I genuinely believe I am genderqueer. I do not wish to adopt the stringent societal requirements of adopting either dictated gender. I think my identity consists of masculine and feminine components to complement each other to make the real me.

My true hope is to gain a feminine body through HRT and cosmetic surgery (fat transfer for larger hips, buttocks and breasts). This more adequately reflects my physical desires and needs while keeping some of my masculine components. This would effectively see me gaining my passion for a more feminine appearance while keeping my role as a dad to my kids and husband to my wife and broadly presenting as more masculine in public. Despite not viewing myself as a male, I would still wish to adopt the title 'husband' and 'dad' as I enjoy these roles in my life and maintain this with my family.

I would be keen to change my pronouns to they/them, my gender classification to X at work and in life, and truly view myself as genderqueer or nonbinary.

I would likely maintain a more masculine outward style of dress in public while adopting more feminine items for underwear, around homes etc. I would wish to grow my hair out and have feminine hairstyles. Ultimately I would want to combine a masculine and feminine style in life. 

Does this make sense, or am I completely on the wrong path?

I am genuinely sorry if I have offended anyone by anything I say here. I am still coming to understand the best terms to ensure I do not cause distress to any other people. Happy for any constructive criticism or feedback on my use of language.",t94ltr,6,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/t94ltr/need_advice_amab_and_confused/,"['All I have to say is congratulations on gaining such great insight into yourself!

If being a man is a gender, then what does it contents include? Does feeling *masculine* makes one feel like a man? I wonder this because, well, our ideas of masculinity can change with time and place. Would a person whose sense of masculinity is very different from the general public's still feel like they are a man or would that make them possibly queer?

I understand this is a slightly academic question. But as someone who is an aspiring academician, thinking in these terms is what helps me understand my own self.

A very clear example of masculine women is butch lesbian women and stone butch lesbian women. (Not to say that non-lesbian masculine women don\'t exist, more that butch lesbianism is a /very/ clear example).\n\nAdditionally, how I figured out that I /wasn\'t/ a man (despite not knowing what one was) was by asking men ""Do you feel like a man?"" the answer was always yes, even when it was a ""weak yes"" or ""passively yes"".\n\nSince the answer to that is never a clear cut ""yes"" for me (even when I am comfortably masculine) I figured out that I probably wasn\'t a man.\n\nAs far as I\'ve been able to figure out, concluded from asking people with a gender what it\'s like and comparing to my own (lack of) gender? Gender (man, women, maverique, etc) is a gut feeling, something experienced similar to how emotions are experienced.', 'This is something I\'ve mulled over for a long time and I have settled on two possible solutions: one, that you\'re a man because society defines you as a man, and two, you\'re a man because you define yourself as a man. I think both solutions work together to create unique experiences for trans people in particular.\n\nWhat I mean by that is this: I\'m AFAB and transitioning. I identify as bigender, not as a man or a woman exclusively. Right now, according to society, I an a woman, and I get treated as such. When I\'m further along in my transition, I\'ll look like what people consider to be a man, and I\'ll be treated as such. But I\'ll never be the same as a cis woman or a cis man, because cis people don\'t experience that transition and don\'t have their gender dangling by a string to be revoked when someone finds out ""the truth.""\n\nSo, I identify as bigender because I\'ll be simultaneously considered man and woman, and because I don\'t believe I\'ll ever adhere to the standards set up for men and women purely because they require cisness. But that\'s just my definition of gender, and it changes depending on who you\'re talking to. So a trans woman is a woman simply because she says she is, and she\'s trans because of the circumstances of her birth. And her experiences are unique to that of trans women specifically because she identifies as a woman.', 'When I broke down the ways in which I feel gendered, I found that I feel the following:\n\n* biological: female --> resulting in femme fashion choices to fit the frame (although tomboy-femme aesthetics, see below)\n\n* social: female - people perceive me this way because of my physiological characteristics, regardless of my style choices\n\n* behavioural: some feminine, more masculine\n\n* aesthetic: some feminine, more masculine\n\n* interpersonal (platonic): mostly masculine\n\n* interpersonal (romantic): some feminine, some masculine\n\n* interpersonal (sexual): more feminine (only due to physiology mainly, otherwise balanced)\n\n* intrapersonal (sexual): some feminine, some masculine\n\nI consider myself ambigender: both agender woman and libramasculine. I have a partial connection with masculinity, not maleness. I think the word ""man"" can include any/all of these and more. But since I feel masculine only to a certain extent across different paradigms *and* have no dysphoria about my biological sex, I don\'t think of myself as either male or a man. I think if someone didn\'t have dysphoria but felt more masculine across several paradigms, they might feel like a man. Equally, if someone did have dysphoria and wanted/had gender reassignment but were gender non-conforming and not particularly masculine in other areas, they might also feel like a man.', 'This sounds somewhat familiar.  Through most of my life I identified as a man, just one who\'s sense of masculinity was completely different than the world\'s.  Generally I realized that the world would not accept me for who I was, that even those fighting for gender equality would always see the gender roles they claimed were optional before they would see me as a human being.  I don\'t see this as any kind of personal slight, but a result of our brains being big implicit bias machines, always looking for things that fit what we see.\n\nSo, after a couple decades of having my personal identity as a man denied and substituted with society\'s idea of what a man is, I was pummelled into not identifying as one anymore.  (Well, tbh, I ran into a specific horrible situation that\\` made my brain break and really laid out plainly how \\`arbitrary and harmful our view of gender is even in ""safe"" spaces and it was kind of like a switch flipping and a little light coming on labelled ""If this is how the world works, then I can\'t be a man.""  Not can\'t as in don\'t want to be, as in ""it\'s impossible"").\n\nSo to me, feeling like a man means fitting what your brain\'s conceptualization of what a man is.  Despite our best efforts, we cannot always control how our brains view a concept.  Sometimes we can when it\'s near the edge, sometimes it shifts by itself.  It gets complicated for some people, less so for others depending on the strength and nature of their internal concepts of gender and how closely they match them.']"

789,Trying Not to Cry...,"** EDIT AT BOTTOM** So. I'm going to a major library conference in March, and many of us got our conference badges in the mail today. Waaaay back, months ago, when I initially registered, I had chosen cis-gender pronouns because they didn't have any (what I call) mix-gender pronouns: she/they, as an example. However, in the last couple of months, and some of it in part due to this page's strength and guidance, I've slowly come out as nonbinary to folx. At work and in life, I use they/she or she/they pronouns (and am slowly moving towards they/them/theirs). So, at the start of January, feeling brave, I went back and edited my profile for the conference. Through the website, if you don't use their pre-populated list of pronouns (she/he/they/xe/ze) or Ask, you could put ""Other"", and then provide your pronouns, **which I did.** I literally put ""she/they"". 

I got my badge this afternoon, and was all excited. I opened it...and in the line for pronouns? Other. It's listed as Other. 

Am I being overly sensitive or emotional about this? Like, part of me is rationalizing that since I had to select ""Other"", and was then required to fill out the ""Other"" pronouns, the system didn't catch the pronouns provided? But also...ouch?

*ETA: so a colleague and amazing ally reacted faster than I did and fired off several emails to the conference planners. It was indeed an error via the system the conference event planner didn‚Äôt catch, and the organization holding the conference is rectifying. As far as I can tell, anyone who‚Äôs badge said ‚Äúother‚Äù and didn‚Äôt include the correct pronouns will be reprinted. I‚Äôm hoping to hear more today.

790,lots of confusions,"I came to identify as genderfluid in high school and even chose a name for myself but never truly identified as myself- never used that name in person or my preferred pronouns.

791,I‚Äôm really confused,"Hey friends! 

I‚Äôm sorry, because you probably get a million posts like this weekly and they might be exhausting by now. I‚Äôm just really struggling with my gender identity, and I am hoping for some clarity. I only came across the term gender queer today somehow, and it might fit me better than non-binary or other identities I have thought of. 

I may ask questions that are‚Ä¶ more direct I guess you could say? I truly don‚Äôt mean to offend- I am just someone who needs a firm ‚Äúyes you dummy, that means x‚Äù. Like, I didn‚Äôt accept that I was attracted to the same sex until I realized that thinking ‚ÄúI wish I was gay so I could be with and sleep with people my own gender‚Äù was a gay thing. And I thought it for YEARS but only realized when a friend was like ‚Äúuhhhh‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs pretty fucking gay lol.‚Äù when I told her. I am dense as a pound cake and need some coddling basically LOL. 


So I am AFAB, and have always identified as female before. There‚Äôs always been struggles with my gender, but so far I have thought they were just because I‚Äôm not expressing myself as ‚Äúfemme‚Äù all the time. I know that you don‚Äôt need to present as femme to be a woman- 400%. Most of the time I do not present that way, and I still feel womanly (whatever that means) or whatever. 

I have fantasized about having a penis for a while. But like, I don‚Äôt like the idea of giving up my more feminine traits or sex organs either. I wish I could have both if that makes sense! The thought of a prosthetic to wear sometimes (which I also had no idea existed until today) is kind of awesome to me. I don‚Äôt know what situations I would like that in, but it seems appealing to me. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äútop‚Äù in FF relationships either, so a strap on was never like a thing I was looking to get either. The prosthetic is different to me though. Idk. Maybe I‚Äôm being dense again hahaha. 

I grew up with two younger brothers, and a dad that clearly valued them over me. I am not sure if my sudden gender issues are because my dad died almost three years ago now, so I am able to separate gender from my issues with my dad or what. I was always the type of kid to do the opposite or double down when I recognized totally unfair treatment, so maybe I was super feminine and attached to that for a while as a way to spite my dad? Idk. He had really weird and gross views about women too so I thought I had to live up to that ideal. 

ANYWAYS. That‚Äôs a lot of word vomit. I might have made no sense, and I sincerely appreciate anyone who read this whole post! I‚Äôm just a (current) lady confused about my identity, and maybe going through a quarter life crisis ish now that I‚Äôm in my late twenties. Also, I now identify as bi if that changes things are all! 

I just don‚Äôt know who I am, and I don‚Äôt know if I am gender queer. It seems nice to be able to identify fluidly, but I am so confused. I think I am maybe thinking if this in terms of gender norms so that‚Äôs tripping me up to. I‚Äôve read so many things, but I am so confused. Please help me :(

I‚Äôm looking into identifying as Genderqueer to keep it broad but I would like to hear if anyone feels something similar as I do but maybe identify otherwise or such! 

I am AFAB but I mostly feel and identify as masculine/male and like being perceived as much, I would say a good 80% of the time. I mostly prefer he/him pronouns as well. 
I dress feminine a lot too sometimes but still like being perceived as male occasionally.

Maybe like the other 15% of the time I would be okay with being perceived as female and dress feminine. 

The other 5% I just don‚Äôt wanna be anything or perceived as anything at all.

I‚Äôve never liked people thinking I was male before, but in the past week or so I‚Äôve been thinking that it would be pretty OK, but not my favorite. I‚Äôve also considered neopronouns and they/them pronouns, but the latter doesn‚Äôt seem to fit and I don‚Äôt know how to use the former for others, never mind myself. I‚Äôve taken a bunch of sexuality quizzes and they‚Äôve all said that I was genderfluid, non-binary, transmasc, or just plain female, and even though none of them are genderqueer, I was thinking that label might fit me better. I know none of them know who I am better than I do, but I really have no idea what my gender is, and if it even does relate to my pronouns. Please help!

I‚Äôm 23 and was starting to think I‚Äôd never catch up to everyone else, as until recently I was still a virgin and I had never had my first kiss. It took me up until a couple years ago to realize and accept that I was queer because of a conservative upbringing, and I didn‚Äôt have any romantic relationships in high school or college. When I started to dress more femme and embrace my gender identity, I thought it would only make it harder to attract a potential partner.

812,Gender Struggles & Feeling Impostery,"Hey y‚Äôall! I‚Äôve been thinking about making a post on this subreddit for a very long time because I‚Äôm really struggling with understanding my gender identity and keep reading other folks‚Äô posts to try to see how other people experience being genderqueer. I‚Äôm still confused about my own gender though so I apologize if I‚Äôm repeating another person‚Äôs experience and also for likely a very long post because I struggle with being succinct!

I‚Äôm afab and I feel like genderqueer best describes my experience because I don‚Äôt *really* feel like a woman, but I‚Äôm comfortable with more feminine gender expressions and I‚Äôm incredibly worried that my experience isn‚Äôt genderqueer enough. I‚Äôve always had questions about gender identity, but I truthfully have found myself often complacent and feeling like it‚Äôd just be easier to live as a cis woman, as though figuring out my gender is a little too much at times that I wonder if it‚Äôs worth it in the end. (Of course, if a friend told me this I would tell them that self-discovery is always worth it and that you deserve to know and live your truth, but obviously it‚Äôs different for me lol).

I am 23 right now and if I had to chronologically-order my experiences with gender, it would go something like this: 1. ***Childhood***\- embodying that ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù trope and big ‚Äútom-boy‚Äù energy; 2. ***Teenager***\- recognizing the toxic misogyny I‚Äôve internalized and countered that with acceptance of more femininity and stronger ties to womanhood as a form of empowerment; 3. ***Young-adult***\- ‚Äúhey so I don‚Äôt mind certain forms of femininity, but I actually don‚Äôt think *woman* feels comfortable to me and maybe I really don't feel like other girls lol?‚Äù I have one friend who I‚Äôve told that I feel like I could be genderqueer & I‚Äôve asked to use they/them with me to see how it feels (incredibly grateful for them, more than they'd ever know haha!). I feel genuine happiness when hearing they/them pronouns and other gender-neutral terms/adjectives used to refer to me (like dapper & spiffy!) and am becoming increasingly more uncomfortable with she/her along with continued perceptions of woman around my personhood.

The thing that I‚Äôm struggling with is that I don‚Äôt feel like my gender *expression* is outside of the binary enough to feel like it‚Äôd be appropriate to use genderqueer to describe my gender to others. I like whatever is going on in the middle between feminine and androgyne expression with special attention to that closest-quarter on the spectrum towards androgyne. I don‚Äôt know how else to explain this, but it just feels like at times that the image of androgyne is almost too masculine to my brain (which of course, I understand the difference between androgynous and masculine expression matters to a lot of people and that‚Äôs absolutely valid, I am just saying for my brain I don‚Äôt see much difference).

**In short, it would be very easy for me to continue being perceived as a cis woman because I‚Äôm comfortable with the way I dress and behave in ways that are more conforming to femininity and more feminine gender roles. I'm just feeling less comfortable with being perceived as a** ***woman*** **and oftentimes I feel like I'm being ridiculous and invalid for feeling this way.**

So I‚Äôm experiencing really bad imposter syndrome to where I worry that I would be doing a disservice to genderqueer folks out there to use ‚Äúgenderqueer‚Äù as a term that describes my experience. I‚Äôm also absolutely terrified that the one friend I feel safe experimenting gender with is the only person I‚Äôll ever feel confident enough to try to explain my experience with gender due to a fear of rejection/scrutiny/disappointment. I‚Äôm not sure what I hope to get from making this post, but I‚Äôve been mulling over this for a long time now & I‚Äôm feeling very lost and uncertain on what the right thing to do/feel is if that makes sense?

I was also a bit of a tomboy growing up and leaned into my femininity, especially around friends, as a teen and young adult. I was, to anyone‚Äôs knowledge including my own, a cis straight female. It wasn‚Äôt until I was 23 that I (separately) started exploring my sexuality and 27 that I started exploring my gender. In the four years between coming out as pansexual and coming out as genderqueer, I slowly transitioned my style and my physical look to be more androgynous/ masc. I felt like I was finally expressing the real me, being an out, more masc, ‚Äúwoman‚Äù. But something was still missing even when I was shopping in the mens section and cut my hair shorter and shorter. It wasn‚Äôt until I started seeing more nonbinary and genderfluid content online that I felt like I could really relate to people about my experiences with gender. I was most often fine being perceived as a woman and wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed with dysphoria. But the more a I started to dig into my own gender the less comfortable with being assumed to be one of the ‚Äúladies‚Äù. I now most strongly identify as gender fluid because I really do feel like I can wake up with different gender expressions day to day. Sometimes I‚Äôm dressed full masc being gendered in public as he/him, and sometimes I want to wear a tight dress to show off my body. Most frequently I like to toe my own personal perfect balance between masc and fem. I started telling people recently and part of me thinks that I told people too fast, before I was able to articulate my feelings about my gender well. The rest of me feels relieved and knows that the imposter syndrome will only go away if I face my fears and exist how I want to exist and identify as I was to identify and present how I want to present on and given day.

813,"My response to the person who keeps claiming that gender nonconformity is just a ""choice"" that people make.","I notice that you blocked me after I called you out on such misinformation, rather than offering the courtesy of a reply. So I will respectfully share my thoughts here instead.

**You stated: ""Choosing whether to conform or not is a choice, something you do.""**

I notice you do this a lot -- framing gender nonconforming people like myself as making a ""choice"". There are plenty of aspects of my gender nonconformity that are not chosen. I have a lisp for example. I also have a limp wrist and a narrow gait. Those are not ""choices"".

And most importantly, I have an effeminate personality, which may not be expressed at all. In some cases it may be actively repressed, particularly if I'm in a situation where I feel threatened or intimidated.

Ultimately the ""choice"" argument is a red herring, and it is particularly harmful and dangerous given its long history of institutionalized violence against LGBTQ people based on the errant assumption that being gay, trans, etc. is voluntary. So it is indeed quite disconcerting that you are relying on such similar rhetoric in order to spread misinformation about gender nonconforming people.

Here's the thing: The only ""choice"" I am making is to *fake* being ""a real man"" -- to deny my intrinsic and authentic feminine nature -- just to make other people comfortable so that they will not physically or verbally attack me. And that is certainly not a ""choice"" that anyone should have to make.
