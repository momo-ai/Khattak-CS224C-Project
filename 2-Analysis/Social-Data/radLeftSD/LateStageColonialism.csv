1,WE DECLARE 17 DAYS OF INTERNATIONAL CELEBRATION UPON THE DEATH OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II!!!,"
To counter HM King Charles III's declaration of 17 days of national mourning, we are proud to declare our own 17 days of International Celebration upon the death of his absolute shit of a mother. 

Queen Elizabeth II presided over Britain's descent into neo-liberal hell and Britain's rampant neo-colonialism across the world. Her reign saw 70 Years of compounding of misery for the people of this country.  A royal parasite, she extorted the British people out of millions of pounds to fill her own off shore accounts, and stole billions more from Britain’s colonies throughout the global south, to maintain her multiple palaces and ensure her criminal children avoided any legal ramifications. The Queen has done nothing for the British people. She has served only herself faithfully. We're glad she's dead. It's a shame she didn't die 70 years ago. 

We recognise the death of Elizabeth II does not mean the end of aristocracy, colonialism, elitism and privilege in Britain or the world. The class struggle is a long arduous battle and the death of one billionaire does not mean it's end. But our very vocal, very open disrespect for the Crown and all it represents is our attempt to attack the shield of reverence that guards the monarchy from true criticism and radical change. Performative mourning and solemnity in the wake of that wretched woman's death does nothing but reinforce the cult of personality that surrounds her and protects the aristocratic class. The cult around King Charles is far less powerful and gives us hope we can use his unpopularity to finally put the final nail in the coffin of lingering British feudalism.

For those who still need further explanation of this position, we include links to resources that will help better inform you of the issues of the British monarchy and our principled stand against them and why we revel in the death of a monarch.

And we hope more will join us soon. If you moderate a subreddit and wish to join our declaration, feel free to message the mods and let us know.

Though the left can often feel divided, its important that find some common ground. And in this, all true leftists can find joy. 

We no longer feel any need to seem 'respectable' in the eyes of liberals, conservatives, fascists and the reactionary 'left'. We do not compromise with the right and we drink their tears as their Queen's corpse rots. 

We hope the death of the Queen means the final chapter for monarchy, not just in Britain, but the world over. It's time for all those who believe in true democracy and human liberation to end this archaic anachronism. 

But for now, in this joyous moment, let the Crab Rave continue:

[Their economy is pretty dependent on importation of food](https://www.akfoodpolicycouncil.org/blog/2021/6/22/2021-alaska-food-security-investment-recommendations) so perhaps this was a decision lobbied in Alaskan politics as to monopolize higher costs of food over that of food security, however I’d be shocked if this was the case, Alaska’s rated corruption doesn’t rank high in North America, let alone the world.\n\n**Edit***: it has come to my attention some of information I was given about Alaska was wrong, they are infact a relatively [highly corrupt government](http://www.ktoo.org/2014/06/16/alaska-tops-corruption-rankings-policy-journal/) in the Western 1st World.', 'lol least delusional tankie spewing lies', ""honest question \n\nwhat does that do *other* than virtue signal.\n\nif *all* these countries view it as a right, why don't they provide food for free to everyone?"", ""Source: https://geneva.usmission.gov/2017/03/24/u-s-explanation-of-vote-on-the-right-to-food/ America's reason for voting 'no'\n\nThis Council, should be outraged that so many people are facing famine because of a manmade crisis caused by, among other things , armed conflict in these four areas.  The resolution before us today rightfully acknowledges the calamity facing millions of people and importantly calls on states to support the United Nations’ emergency humanitarian appeal.  However, the resolution also contains many unbalanced, inaccurate, and unwise provisions that the United States cannot support.  This resolution does not articulate meaningful solutions for preventing hunger and malnutrition or avoiding its devastating consequences.  This resolution distracts attention from important and relevant challenges that contribute significantly to the recurring state of regional food insecurity, including endemic conflict, and the lack of strong governing institutions.  Instead, this resolution contains problematic, inappropriate language that does not belong in a resolution focused on human rights.\n\nFor the following reasons, we will call a vote and vote “no” on this resolution.  First, drawing on the Special Rapporteur’s recent report, this resolution inappropriately introduces a new focus on pesticides.  Pesticide-related matters fall within the mandates of several multilateral bodies and fora, including the Food and Agricultural Organization, World Health Organization, and United Nations Environment Program, and are addressed thoroughly in these other contexts.  Existing international health and food safety standards provide states with guidance on protecting consumers from pesticide residues in food.  Moreover, pesticides are often a critical component of agricultural production, which in turn is crucial to preventing food insecurity.\n\nSecond, this resolution inappropriately discusses trade-related issues, which fall outside the subject-matter and the expertise of this Council.  The language in paragraph 28 in no way supersedes or otherwise undermines the World Trade Organization (WTO) Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, which all WTO Members adopted by consensus and accurately reflects the current status of the issues in those negotiations.  At the WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in 2015, WTO Members could not agree to reaffirm the Doha Development Agenda (DDA).  As a result, WTO Members are no longer negotiating under the DDA framework.  The United States also does not support the resolution’s numerous references to technology transfer.\n\nWe also underscore our disagreement with other inaccurate or imbalanced language in this text.  We regret that this resolution contains no reference to the importance of agricultural innovations, which bring wide-ranging benefits to farmers, consumers, and innovators.  Strong protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, including through the international rules-based intellectual property system, provide critical incentives needed to generate the innovation that is crucial to addressing the development challenges of today and tomorrow.  In our view, this resolution also draws inaccurate linkages between climate change and human rights related to food.\n\nFurthermore, we reiterate that states are responsible for implementing their human rights obligations.  This is true of all obligations that a state has assumed, regardless of external factors, including, for example, the availability of technical and other assistance.\n\nWe also do not accept any reading of this resolution or related documents that would suggest that States have particular extraterritorial obligations arising from any concept of a right to food.\n\nLastly, we wish to clarify our understandings with respect to certain language in this resolution.  The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.  The United States does not recognize any change in the current state of conventional or customary international law regarding rights related to food.  The United States is not a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Accordingly, we interpret this resolution’s references to the right to food, with respect to States Parties to that covenant, in light of its Article 2(1).  We also construe this resolution’s references to member states’ obligations regarding the right to food as applicable to the extent they have assumed such obligations."", '>US votes no\n\nStill the biggest provider of humanitarian aid in the world by 9 billion dollars', 'The only logical position.\n\nFood cannot be a human right.', 'We can clearly see how Russia cares about human rights', 'What I wish they meant by ""food is a human right""... community gardens, direct purchasing from farmers, teaching students how to grow and cultivate food, etc.\n\nWhat they really mean: here\'s your government approved cricket biscuit']"

The images that seem to have been taken in the Girê Cûdî Resistance Area, which reached the ANF and fell to the west of the Zap on September 11, 2022, are blood-curdling. Although HPG shared their names, tags and even images, it is seen that the Turkish army, which concealed its losses, burned the bodies of its own soldiers this time.

HPG Press  Center (BİM) announced in its statement on September 12 that the Turkish army burned the bodies of its own soldiers. The statement was as follows: *“Turkish soldiers who tried to enter the Martyr Çekdar war tunnels of Girê Cûdî Resistance Area on September 11 were put under control; It was ambushed at 10:00 and then hit by sabotage tactics. In this action, which was carried out simultaneously and in coordination with our forces in the war tunnels and our mobile teams, the invaders were later hit with hand grenades, individual weapons and assassination tactics. In these strikes, at least 10 invaders, 1 of which is ranked, were punished and 4 invaders were injured; It was determined that their names were Savaş, Fatih, Gökhan, Serkan, Burak, Naci, Harun, Mert, Oğuz and Fuat.”*

**SOLDIER BOMB THE BODIES OF THEIR DEADS**

The Turkish army bombarded the place where the corpses of the punished invaders were with warplanes and howitzers so that the weapons and materials on them would not fall into the hands of our forces. 1 drone flying over the action area was hit by our mobile teams. Later, 2 more invaders who took action were shot and punished with an assassination tactic.

**BURNING THEIR DEAD**

After bombarding it with warplanes and howitzers, the Turkish army burned the dead bodies of soldiers by bombing and setting fire to the place where their own soldiers’ funerals were with incendiary rockets from attack helicopters. The area of ​​action and the funeral of some of the punished invaders are still under the control of our forces. As a result of the actions that lasted from 10:00 to 16:00, a total of 12 invaders were punished, 4 of them were injured and 1 drone was hit.

342,Studying the Indigenous Languages of Mexico Has Changed My Perspective,"Studying the Spanish spoken in Mexico has given me more perspective about the complexity of language learning. Even though I speak Spanish with Mexicans frequently and traveled there, I never realized that the Indigenous tribes of Mexico had such a big impact on how the language was spoken and how common traditions were celebrated.

This is why I've been consuming a lot of content related to Mexico this year to make me a better Spanish learner. With this knowledge, I can connect more with Mexicans because I understand more of the history that they cherish. I can pronounce words and phrases better since many of them are not just Spanish like the Nahuatl, Maya, Otomí, and Mixteco languages. I can't only use my knowledge of the Spanish language to help me pronounce certain names of cities for example. There is a different type of sound that has to be produced.

For these reasons, I have been taking many Italki lessons from a Spanish tutor from Mexico. I made a video podcast of our conversation about this topic and I am sharing part 2 of it!

I hope you enjoy, thank you for your support, and it is also fully in Spanish! In the video description, you can also find a link to her profile page on Italki to learn more about pricing and how she teaches Spanish.

Although Sunday night’s result was expected, since the polls pointed to an “aprobate” defeat for a new Chilean constituent that would replace the country’s current constitution – which is the one formed during Pinochet’s military dictatorship, which created an extensive neoliberal project under the patronage of the US.

*The new constitution presented points such as:*

* **End of the Senate** – The current constitution divides Congress between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The latter can enhance the work of the deputies. The proposed Constitution eliminates the Senate and creates two Chambers of “asymmetrical” power: a House of Representatives for making laws and a House of Regions only for laws regarding regional agreements, without the weight that the current Senate has had until now.
* **Indigenous justice system**s – the 1980 Constitution makes no reference to original peoples. The new text proposes autonomy for the indigenous people, recognizing 11 peoples and nations, but does not allow an attack on the “unique and indivisible” character of the Chilean State. Among the most controversial points is the recognition of indigenous legal systems, but with the proviso that they must respect the Constitution, international treaties, and that the Supreme Court will have the last word.
* **Gender equality** – The proposed Constitution defines Chile as a parity democracy, in which women will occupy at least 50% of the positions in the powers and organs of state.
* **Abortion**: The 1980 Constitution protects the life of the unborn. In the new text, the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy has been included.
* **Health insurance** – Today, all formal workers must obligatorily allocate 7% of their salary to health care. It is possible to opt for a totally private plan, but this monthly payment often does not fully cover the expenses incurred by an illness. The proposal establishes that the mandatory health expenses must be 100% destined to the public system. People will also be free to contract a private plan.
* **Pensions** – Since the 1980 Constitution, pensions have depended exclusively on worker contributions to private pension funds that pay pensions below the minimum wage of $400 and are 60% less than the last salary. The proposal proposes a public Social Security System, financed by workers and employers.

Because of this, it had become known as the “most progressive constitution in the world.”

**HOW IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ELECTED A NEW CONSTITUTION**

In late 2019 Chile rose up in struggle after high school students protested yet another increase in public transportation fares, in a short time of protests the revolt spread and deepened into a revolt against the reality of the Chilean state system itself. Seen by the western world as the example country of Latin America, Chile has always had barbaric neo-liberal policies which resulted in an extremely unequal society. According to Jose Miguel Ahumada, a political economist and associate professor at the University of Chile, the country is “one of the most unequal countries in Latin America”. As described by The Washington Post, while the last three decades of neoliberal policies made Chile “one of South America’s wealthiest countries, with inflation under control and easy access to credit”, they also “created stark economic disparities and strapped many Chileans into debt”. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) states, that 1% of the population in Chile controls 26.5% of the country’s wealth, while 50% of low-income households access 2.1%. Additionally, according to National Statistics Institute of Chile, while the minimum wage in Chile is 301,000 pesos, half of the workers in that country receive a salary equal to or less than 400,000 pesos.

The protests quickly grew to enormous proportions and clashes with then-President Sebastián Piñera’s police left at least 11,000 injured and 28,000 arrested. During the protests it had been widely reported that women had been harassed and raped in their confinements. The height of the conflict was in October 2019 when Piñera declared a state of emergency and military personnel were seen on the streets…a scene not repeated since the infamous 1973 military coup. On 25 October 2019, over 1.2 million people took to the streets of Santiago to protest against social inequality, demanding President Piñera’s resignation, in what was called as “The biggest march of Chile” as an answer to the Curfew.

Youth played a crucial role in the uprisings, local organizations and popular struggle in this process. It was with the youth protests that the uprising broke out, and with their historic resistance that the countless marches were able to take place despite police attacks. It was the youth who clamored and shouted for a new Chile, one that respects differences, original peoples, gender equality and conditions.

It was clear that with popular organization and persistence much could be achieved, and it was with this mentality and feeling that Gabriel Boric capitalized his votes within the left and was elected president by a congress that could support him. The constituent commission was established and presented as the solution for a radical structural change in the country’s reality. However, it is clear once again that, within capitalist modernity and its tentacles of Leviathan, the changes aspired to by the people will not happen by legalistic means…

In addition to the Boric government’s own culpability for its neoliberal policies – very similar to Pinera’s, by the way – the propaganda apparatus against the constituent did not let up, and with the spread of thousands of fake news reports and big international newspapers like the Washington Post positioning themselves against the proposal, it was possible to organize and gather the rejection votes around this propaganda.

It is essential that those people who have mobilized and occupied the streets, created community organizations and systems, social centers, projects of popular power, remain organized and prepared?the worst consequence of this coup against the democratic forces of Chile will be the lack of hope that it will create in that part of the population and a practice that will remain based on a constitution from the worst period of Chile. **The slogan “Chile will be the tomb of neoliberalism” proves to be even closer to the original “Madrid will be the tomb of fascism” said during the social revolution in Spain in 1936. It is clear that to destroy neoliberalism and its inhuman practices, the People’s Revolution is necessary.**",x6gubg,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/x6gubg/chile_proof_that_the_legalistic_way_does_not_work/,[]

 In the [first part](https://www.nuceciwan111.xyz/en/2022/08/31/democratic-nation-and-the-nation-state-i/), an attempt was made to give a small insight into the discussions on the democratic nation and nationalism. In particular, the apoist historical perspective was examined and statehood and nationalism were elaborated as preconditions for capitalist modernity. In this part, several ideologies from Protestantism via liberalism to capitalism, will be analysed with a focus on the consequences in terms of the history of mentality.

“Only when state power is organised as a nation state can capitalist modernity, and in particular its profit maximisation and capital accumulation, be realised through the economy”, (2) Öcalan states. It is not enough to interpret the nation-state as a tyrannical and monistic model; the ideology of liberalism was also decisive for the rise of capitalism. Dealing with the ideology of liberalism becomes all the more important if we want to understand social life and mentality (3) in capitalist modernity in Germany.

The emerging liberal ideology is closely linked to the interests of the rising bourgeoisies and can be seen as the political and economic equivalent of the bourgeoisies’ quasi-religious dogma – nationalism. The first part outlined how nation-building was linked to the development of internal markets. Liberalism is the ideology that softened the control of the monarchs and dukes as well as the guilds and other associations over the markets and opened the way for the emerging bourgeois classes.

**Steps towards a capitalist economy**

While in medieval Europe production, especially in the cities, was not oriented towards competition but towards the needs of the community and, if necessary, its feudal lords, it was necessary to change this mode of production in order to enforce profit maximisation and accumulation. This was especially true in rural regions, where villages had their commons and produced for their own subsistence and not primarily for the market. Similar institutions to the commons exist in the most diverse regions as commons, ejido or also saynoca. In Europe, these forms of life are or represent mostly living collectivity, as it must have characterised life before the stratification of society and the appropriation of private property in the means of production. This non-alienated form of society is what Abdullah Öcalan calls “natural society”. In medieval Europe agriculture was collective and the community had to pay its dues in the form of labour and/or goods to the feudal lords. The value model of medieval societies also had features adapted to collective life; generosity was respected, while stinginess was one of the deadly sins. (4) People resisted the personalised manifestations of power – the secular and clerical feudal lords – in collective movements. There was a fundamental difference between urban and rural resistance. The cities had become centres of capital accumulation, while the rural areas were increasingly converted from subsistence production to the production of “cash crops”. We can see here a shift from use value to exchange value. The rise of the Reformation and Protestantism must therefore be interpreted against the background of the mercantilist, state capitalist mode of production. (5)

**Protestantism – from social liberation movement to absolute control**

Marx observed: “Hegel remarked somewhere that all great world-historical facts and persons occur, as it were, twice. He forgot to add: one time as tragedy, the other time as farce.” (6) We can see the development of the Reformation as a harbinger of the betrayal of the bourgeoisie by the French Revolution. Martin Luther based his Reformation on the strength of the sixteenth-century peasant social movement, but entered into an alliance with the feudal lords, betraying the peasant revolutionaries around Thomas Müntzer to them and to the proto-bourgeois classes who sought access to land and people under the control of the Catholic Church. While social revolutionaries such as Thomas Müntzer preached the illegitimacy of rule and liberation from princes and clergy, drawing on both urban bourgeoisie and the peasant movement, Luther took his cue from the authorities and presented the status quo as God’s will, Müntzer invoked a right to resist oppression. (7) He relied on the resistant collective to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth, while Luther agitated for salvation from individual access and individual interpretation of biblical teaching. The enforcement of this counter-revolutionary tendency enabled the development of capitalist society through the doctrine of predestination (everything is willed by God and predestined accordingly) and the related unconditional election. Predestination doctrine and unconditional election in this context mean that God has already chosen those who should be saved. Next was the consistent, Calvinist interpretation of this dogma, that God’s favour thus manifested itself in prosperity on earth. Even charity was thus no longer part of Calvinist practice, as it became especially prevalent in the centres of emerging capitalism, such as in the Netherlands or even Great Britain, because people were considered to be poor because of God’s disfavour of them. This laid the foundation for the Protestant ethic described in detail by Max Weber. These developments, which took place in the context of emerging mercantilism and early capitalism, were accompanied by massive expropriations of communal land from the municipalities. Resistance to what were called enclosures also developed in many places, such as the Levellers in Britain. The expropriation also had an economic downside, providing the basis for the labour force for the new imperial projects and eventually for industrialisation. (8)

The deprivation of subsistence led to new modern profound dependency relationships. In terms of mentality, hard work as the meaning of life became the ideal through the Protestant ethic. A stark contrast to the Middle Ages, where work was seen as punishment and not as a means of salvation. In the Bible translations of this period, this ideal manifests itself in the use of the terminology “hew wood and carry water.” (9) Just as Abdullah Öcalan describes the imposition of patriarchy in the late Neolithic and every subsequent imposition of domination and statehood as violent processes, the imposition of bourgeois domination that led to modern neoliberal capitalism was also such a violent process with an unclear outcome at any point in time. First subsistence and later the collectivity of the workforce had to be smashed again and again in order to guarantee the functioning of capitalism. This process of destruction also manifested itself on an ideological level through the development of liberalism, whose roots were deeply buried in Protestant ethics. Calvinist churches in particular were not places for the salvation of souls but disciplinary institutions of God’s reason of state – the preordained decision of damnation or salvation. (10) Thus, the individual is increasingly made responsible for their own social position by Protestant ethics. Being rich, rational, methodical, success-oriented action testified to the grace of God. A brutal ideology that even allowed the legitimisation of the genocide of the indigenous population of North America. Thus, Puritans argued that their genocide of the indigenous population of North America was “manifest destiny”, i.e. manifest foreknowledge – following this logic, there was therefore no missionary policy. The Puritans saw themselves on the winning side and the indigenous population on the losing side, because God had decided this long ago. (11) The bourgeois class with its global sense of mission created the Christian God in its image – white, male and world-dominating.

**Protestantism and Liberalism**

We can thus see a clear intertwining between the thinking of capitalist modernity and Protestant ethics, which extends into the familial, into the patriarchal nuclear family as the reproductive nucleus of labour power and domination in contrast to the medieval extended family unit. In capitalism, as in Protestant ethics, the value of a person is linked to their productivity. This school of thought forms the basis for the development of liberal theories from Adam Smith to Thomas Malthus. Adam Smith, in his work “Wealth of Nations”, developed the concept that the pursuit of individual profit in an unregulated market was the best way to generate wealth. His theory was based on projecting the concept of exchange value into the distant past. So far, there is not a single piece of archaeological or ethnological evidence for this – on the contrary, we see in non-capitalist societies that instead of “exchange value”, “use value” is central and economies are organised through gifting, redistribution and reciprocity and other mechanisms. (12) Smith’s concept breathes the spirit of individualism – the sum of self-interests would add up to the total interest. Here foundations are laid for central contradictions of capitalism – profit maximisation at the expense of people and nature may be profitable in the short term, but in the long term it means destruction. While Smith applied Protestant ethics to economics, Malthus reached into the bag of tricks of population policy. His concept of poverty alleviation was to reduce the number of poor through starvation. “Manifest destiny”, predestination, punishing the poor for their self-inflicted poverty; Malthus is still respected when it comes to population policy.

**Positivism – the Method of Liberalisms**

The theorists of liberalism openly show that everything can be quantified and rationalised. Early Bourgeois rationalism consciously distances itself from Catholic mysticism and gives patriarchy a new push. In rationalism, which is as white as it is male-dominated, there is no longer any room for women figures like Mary – heaven depopulates, there are now only God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit – at least for the time being. For positivism reduces the world, nature, humanity, thinking and feeling to “proven facts” – everything is measured and categorised. “Objective” analytical thinking is presented as free of ideology and social conditions. But scientific objectivity itself in this context represents the transformation of discourse and ideology into “facts”. Just as the Sumerians codified, even essentialised, social hierarchy for millennia in their first occupational lists, objectivity attempts to do this with the prevailing social order as the starting point of “objectivity”. For positivist classification, splitting and structuring is nothing other than the method of liberalism. Positivism reduces humanity to singularities acting only for their own advantage and nature to passive matter to be controlled. Religion is rationalised in this direction and reduced to the concepts of man in the “struggle for existence”. Thus, in the 19th century, Darwin’s theory of evolution was transferred to society in the sense of the nation state – thus paving the way for Nazi terror. The power interests of the nation states were cast in the form of supposedly objective necessities through racial theories.

Biologistic racism and the pathologisation of women under the diagnosis of “hysteria” in the 19th century are cornerstones of this new form of power. Dichotomous thinking in pairs of opposites, the categorisation of everything in the world by an “objective” exterior (e.g. the researcher) is deeply rooted in the Christian-Jewish belief system – in the Book of Genesis in the Bible there is the telling instruction of Yahweh to humans “Be fruitful and multiply, populate the earth, subdue it…”. (13) Man is subject, the earth is object. The ruling classes are subject, while the ruled in capitalism are reduced to terms like “forces” or “human capital”. Positivism exacerbates this concept by linking the idea of progress with domination over nature. We could speak of a new form of sacred rule, a sacred rule by the bourgeoisie, whose substitute for religion is nationalism and the citizen its priest – with or without religious disguise.

But it was not only for the racist division of society and the legitimisation of colonialism that Social Darwinism was used. Social Darwinism became one of the central pillars of what we now call neoliberalism – and what should more concretely be called the class struggle of the ruling classes. Herbert Spencer, who is repeatedly referred to as the “father” of neoliberalism, used categories of Social Darwinism in his expositions to explain capitalist exploitation and accumulation. His studies had been paid for by John D. Rockefeller and Thomas Edison and so he stated that social inequalities were “natural and necessary”. (14)

**Liberalism and Nationalism**

The symbiosis between liberalism and nationalism may seem contradictory, but it is more relevant today than ever before. In particular, the neoliberal ideology of locational nationalism clearly demonstrates this, with the state increasingly vying as an institution for the favour of international capital. The “national competitive state” (15) is defined as a political-economic project of neoliberalism through which all parts of society are subjected to the paradigm of international competitiveness. (16) The main goal of liberalism is to bring the state completely under the control of capital. (17) While liberalism gives itself an anti-state appearance, a strong state is its foundation. Adam Smith defined the protection of private property as the core task of the state – i.e. the state as defender of the class system. While liberalism asserts equality for all, it also preserves and exacerbates inequality by transforming the social contradiction of collectives and classes into a contradiction between individuals. The effect of this is that in Germany, for example, there is hardly any awareness that there is a problem with patriarchal violence, despite the fact that 35% of women in Germany reported having been victims of such violence in 2014. The number of unreported cases is probably much higher. (18) Patriarchal violence and feminicide are described as singular family dramas when they take place in one’s “own” society, while patriarchal violence is located in the “other”.

**Individualism in the context of liberal thought**

As we have shown, liberalism produces individualism, or rather egocentrism, which splits society into isolated, competing micro-units. Liberalism can therefore never mean freedom, but only the opposite of collectivity. It has the inherent paradox that on the one hand it places a lot of emphasis on individual behaviour, but on the other hand it rounds off this concept with a form of “manifest destiny” fatalism: In concrete terms, this means that the individual, deprived of any collectivity, is given the attitude of being only a small grain of sand, a small subject that can only resign itself before the enormous machinery of the state. Freedom is promised under the paradigm “the individual is everything, society is nothing”, which interestingly leads to the same result as its antithesis, “society is everything, the individual nothing”. Both deprive society and thus the individual of its power, its ability to shape reality. This form of absolutism automatically leads to divided individuals – division between public and private, between service and leisure, between the mentality of a political person and a working person, between the activity of an enforcer of deportations and a loving family father …

Society is made up of collectives and individuals – liberalism attacks precisely this structure of society and creates characters as befits capitalist modernity. Responsibility for the status quo is handed over to the state and gladly taken from it – life without the state becomes unimaginable. Individuals in their fear of each other see each other as wolves, they can only “become god” to each other through state power. (19) Hobbes wrote these sentences in the early 16th century, when capitalism and the modern state were beginning to develop – if we look at the following centuries, capitalist modernity, nationalism and statism have produced more “human wolves” than ever before. A side note, Hobbes does the wolves wrong, they are certainly not that cruel – the Hobbesian axiom of etatism has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Through the naturalisation of state power, all forms of reasons of state become acceptable. But nevertheless, democratic modernity exists everywhere and in all of us, it shows itself in historical moments like the revolution of Rojava, but also in all the collective and solidarity actions all over the world.",x3elar,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/x3elar/democratic_nation_and_the_nationstate_ii_in_this/,[]

To approach this term, we first have to understand that the Kurdish movement has set out to reappropriate or reappropriate terms that may well have different connotations in the dominant discourse.

The Kurdish freedom movement has an anti-state and anti-nationalist character. The cornerstones of the apoist model of society, Democratic Autonomy and Democratic Confederalism, have already been discussed on several occasions. With the very important concept of the Democratic Nation, there still remains a certain blank space, although it describes the alternative apoist model to the nation-state at the philosophical-practical level. The blank space arises in the European debate because the concept of nation is always associated with the concept of nation-state, as well as with nationalism: *“The body of nations afflicted with the nationalist spirit expresses itself in the state. Precisely because of their body, these nations are also called nation-states. The body of those nations that are, however, free and in solidarity is Democratic Autonomy. Democratic autonomy means that the individual and society govern themselves with their own will. One can also speak of democratic leadership or democratic authority.”* – (Abdullah Öcalan, KÜRT SORUNU VE DEMOKRATIK ULUS ÇÖZÜMÜ, Kültürel Soykırım Kıskacında Kürtleri Savunmak, 2016).

Thus, we can first of all state that the Democratic Nation is not oriented towards ethnicity or religion, but is defined by a democratic mentality. However, to really approach the concept, we should try to get closer to Abdullah Öcalan’s thought and methods.

In the historical and dialectical method used by Abdullah Öcalan, history does not unfold along the antagonism of capital and labor, as in the classical Marxist method. Rather, it manifests and reproduces itself on new levels within the framework of the antagonism of democratic and state civilization. (It should be noted that the term civilization should be understood here in its original sense of “civitas”, as a community or society, and not in the framework of colonial discourse). In the historical method of the PKK, the teleologically based historical materialism describing the inevitable social development from primitive communism to slave society, feudalism, capitalism, socialism to communism is understood as not immutable. The “natural society” or “primitive communism” was already described by Engels as a matricentric society and many findings from the Neolithic, especially depictions of goddesses, as well as mythologies seem to provide evidence for such an interpretation, as does the systematic repression of women at the social level in the state structures of Sumer, Akkad and the following (3). This also supports Öcalan’s observation that the imposition of domination and patriarchy was not inevitable, but a process that was maintained through violence and betrayal: “In particular, the epic of Inanna, the goddess of the first city-state of Uruk, is very revealing. This epic, which describes a time when matricentric and patriarchal cultures were in equilibrium, narrates a harsh confrontation: Inanna, as goddess of Uruk, seeks out Enki, the god of the city of Eridu, in his palace, and there claims the hundred and four “I’s,” the basic discoveries and inventions of civilization, which she considers to be her rightful property. Through various methods, he manages to return them to Uruk. This legend is a key narrative that helps to understand that era. In the epic, Inanna strongly emphasizes that the “I’s” as achievements of civilization belong to the mother goddess, that the male god Enki had nothing to do with them, but stole them by force and cunning. All of Inanna’s efforts revolve around the recovery of this culture from the mother goddess”

Although it is not easy, in the context of material findings, to explore supposedly vanished forms of society, mythology and narrative offer a rich treasure trove of insights. The primordial society, which is not a paradise even for Öcalan, but the society that existed before the imposition of the “sacred rule” of hierarchy, in its first form as patriarchy and gerontocracy, rule of the old (men), has not ceased to be, but persists as a substrate, as what Öcalan calls Democratic Civilization, which opposes state civilization and continues to resist capitalist modernity to this day.

Therefore, moving away from historical determinism and assuming that an alternative development would have been possible at any time implies that this remains true for today.

Öcalan points out that the ultimate expression of capitalist modernity is the nation-state. The nation-state that has conjured up centuries of genocide and wars in Europe and covered the Middle East with monist regimes. In this context, the formation of the nation-state must be understood as a process that began in the sixteenth century and fructified in eighteenth and early nineteenth century Europe. Its roots are to be found in the bourgeoisie and bourgeois society, which got rid of the absolutist regime with the French Revolution by exploiting the oppressed, women. If the dismantling of customs barriers had already been the content of absolutist mercantilism, nationalism as a bourgeois ideology now took over this task. Öcalan states that the erroneous analysis of the nation-state and the problem of the state itself in Marxism-Leninism contributed to the downfall of real socialism: *“The inadequate analysis of the question of the state by socialist ideology only deepened the problem (…) especially the right of self-determination of nations, the idea of a state for each nation contributed massively to deepening the problem. The idea of the Democratic Nation “differs from real socialism and the classic Marxist-Leninist doctrine that sustains it. The right of self-determination is freed from its limitation as a bourgeois right and is linked to the standard of social democracy. Concretely, this means that the solution of the Kurdish question is possible without statist contamination, without the pursuit of a nation-state principle and without being forced into such categories; it can be realized through democratic models of self-management of society. This is the essence of the PKK’s transformation.*” As for the concept of nation-state, Öcalan harshly criticizes the overlapping of the concepts of people and nation, ethnicity and demos. Ephraim Nimni of the Center for Ethnic Conflict Studies also follows this logic when, like Öcalan, he describes the problems of the nation-state as structural; he states that “culture becomes an almost totalitarian feature for unity” something we can clearly perceive again and again in the debates in Germany, but also in the regime in Turkey. The anthropologist Gellner describes assimilation, expulsion and murder (so-called “ethnic cleansing”) as a consequence of the logic of nationalism; the 20th century bears witness to this thesis. For the aggressive nationalist mobilizations of the 20th century, congruence between state and culture was a basic requirement.

The development of modern nation states is, as I have said, closely linked to the development of modern capitalism and its markets. Western European states gradually began to replace imperial concepts in the 16th century. This process culminated when the bourgeoisie overtook the kings and feudal lords in the French Revolution and took their place. Women, the exploited women who had driven this revolution, were betrayed, murdered and subjugated at the first opportunity by the new bourgeois elite of state civilization. Nation building took place in the context of the defense and conquest of the market. Feudal taxes were abolished for the capital of its own bourgeoisie. Nations were defined as territories of production and consumption – internally at first, but aggressively expansive after consolidation. The nation, defined as “people,” provided and continues to provide the glue to bind the oppressed to the oppressors. Social scientist Jeffrey Miley describes this development as follows: “*Britain, for example, used the concept of Britishness to make the working class identify with imperial projects. (…) This represents a historical problematic that culminated in the rise of fascism in interwar Europe, when state actors used the reference to the nation to mobilize the masses.*” We can see that the nation-state perspective permeated everything. While positivism ostensibly displaced religion, the nation-state seems to have taken the place of God. This shows the emerging sacralization of the nation and the essentialization of this fictitious concept. Essentialization and sacralization were also evident in the emergence of “biological” racism and social Darwinism as naturalizations of the capitalist model. Nation-state thinking encompassed all areas of society and, therefore, intellectuals and philosophers were also not in a position to criticize the state system as such; at best, they were limited to partial aspects such as production. Today, in the discourse on the competitive nation state, which in Germany shows itself as a debate on localization, we see once again that the nation state is not the opposite of globalized neoliberalism, as the nationalists would have us believe, but the confrontation of workers in several competing nation states in order to win the favor of capital, in fact a frankly classical application of the nation state principle.

In contrast, apoism radically rejects this definition of nation as state, as its description of women as “the first oppressed nation” demonstrates. The understanding of the Democratic Nation is not based on territory, identity or culture, but on shared values. The Democratic Nation can coexist with states, but practically it manifests itself through Democratic Autonomy and Democratic Confederalism, its expression is radical democracy, not homogeneity but plurality as a characteristic. The separation of subject and object, manifested in dichotomies such as mind (subject) and matter (nature/object), man (subject) and woman (object), reflects the division of society into rulers and ruled. An important feature of the philosophy of the democratic nation is the abolition of this subject-object dichotomy: the individual and society are not conceived as a contradiction or a unity, but the individual as something that can only be understood in a social context, that can only be free in the context of a political society and, conversely, a society can only be free through free individuals. Not the postmodern subjectivist individual who is so isolated that he is powerless in the face of “society” – here equated with the state – and not the modern individual who means nothing in the state or society and is therefore powerless, but the individual who organizes himself freely in radical democratic structures and thus shapes society together with others. However, radical democracy also means the democratic assumption of all tasks taken away from society by the state, defense, justice, the judiciary, as well as the construction of relations beyond patriarchal oppression and exploitation. Here it becomes clear that the closed democratic nation cannot exist at all, but is about a continuous change of self-understanding in the individual – from the self-understanding of the subjectivist or objectivist speck of dust in the face of the leviathan of the state to a conscious and free individual who is in connection with and organized in society.

*“We are convinced that people are more enslaved under capitalist rule – liberalism creates the illusion of freedom – in this sense, individual freedom must be discussed. Sure, we don’t live in the time of religion and kings, but people are still unable to become free individuals, they become objects. Maybe people are not sold as often as before, but today the same thing is practiced with more subtle methods. The struggle is difficult, but it cannot succeed without the liberation of the individual; we have to ask ourselves: how free am I?”*

*(Abdullah Öcalan, 2016).*

Speaking about the isolation imposed on Kurdish People’s Leader Abdullah Öcalan, Bayık stated that the Turkish state had punished Leader Abdullah Öcalan with legal fraud. Emphasizing that the Turkish state cannot break the bond between the Kurdish people and Leader Apo despite all the pressures, Bayık said that Leader Apo’s ideas are spreading more and more every day.

KCK Executive Council Co-Chair Cemil Bayık pointed out that the AKP-MHP government was entirely responsible for the massacre in Antep and Derik, and said, “This is not an accident, it is a massacre. Our people should not accept those murderers when they come to their condolences, they should be fired. “Our people will accept this. This is not true. This situation is incompatible with patriotism, humanity and moral values.”

Pointing out that the guerrilla is struggling with great difficulties in Zap, Avaşîn and Metina, Bayık stated that the Kurdish people should support the guerrilla. Reminding that the Turkish state is stuck in the face of the guerrilla despite advanced technology, Bayık emphasized that this war will bring the end of the AKP-MHP.

KCK Executive Council Co-chair Cemil Bayık’s interview with Stêrk TV is as follows:

**Kurdish People’s Leader Abdullah Öcalan is in a great isolation. Despite this, the agenda in Turkey revolves around Leader Apo. How do you evaluate this situation?**

There is a vigil in Strasbourg for the physical freedom of Rêber Apo, a campaign was started by the trade unions in England, hundreds of intellectuals and writers made statements. I hereby greet everyone who stands against the genocidal policy of the Turkish state and fights for the physical freedom of the Leader, and I offer my respects. They are waging a very sacred struggle. Because protecting Rêber Apo is protecting freedom, democracy, peoples and human values. There are many reasons why the isolation against the leadership has been so aggravated. First, they are afraid of Rêber Apo. They do not want their voices to reach the people. Because they know very well how much the Leadership affects the people.

Another reason for deepening the isolation; Leadership is leaving 24 years behind in the dungeon. It’s almost 25 years. According to European laws, the Turkish state must reconsider the punishment imposed on the Leader. In fact, Rêber Apo needs to be taken out of the dungeon. But the Turkish Leadership wants to keep it in prison until the end and destroy it. That’s why they make false claims from a legal point of view. For example, they say “he has committed a disciplinary offence”. The Turkish state must give an answer to Europe by September. The Turkish state also wants to prevent this with these false disciplinary punishments. Our people, especially lawyers, need to understand this very well and seriously consider it. They must thwart the legal frauds of the Turkish state.

No matter what the Turkish state does, it cannot break the Leader’s ties with the Kurdish people, the PKK, the peoples, and humanity. This is not possible. Rêber Apo is now in the hearts of peoples, especially women. It is not possible for the Turkish state to change this. That’s why he’s just deceiving himself. Because Rêber Apo’s ideas and philosophy are spreading more and more each day. Those who fight for freedom, democracy and socialism embrace Rêber Apo more and more every day. Rêber Apo said, “Where my defenses are, there I am.” Rêber Apo’s Defenses are everywhere right now. Everyone who reads and understands Rêber Apo takes care of him. Therefore, more than anyone else, the cadres of this movement should ensure that Rêber Apo’s ideas are further disseminated. Protecting Rêber Apo is protecting the Kurdish people, AKP-MHP fascism,

**There was a massacre in Derik and Antep recently, it is called an accident, but it was a kind of massacre. In your statement, you stated that the hostility of the Turkish state to the Kurdish people led to these massacres. It was even reported to the press that it was a third truck. How do you evaluate these events?**

As it is known, the Turkish state does not recognize the Kurdish people and carries out a policy of genocide against the Kurdish people. The AKP-MHP government continues its policy of genocide at the highest level. He doesn’t hide it either. He explains to the press how many Kurds he killed every day. The Turkish state, the AKP-MHP government, is not only hostile to the PKK or the Bakur Kurds, but to all Kurds wherever they are. They also see the ongoing World War III as an opportunity for them. They want to take this opportunity to complete the genocide against the Kurdish people. That’s why they put all their resources into use. They tied their fate to the destruction of the PKK and the genocide of the Kurdish people. In order to stay in power, they are making unlimited hostility towards the Kurds.

Just as ISIS is committing massacres, the Turkish state is also doing it. Just as ISIS attacks and massacres people with cars and motorcycles, this is what the Turkish state has done. Great massacres took place both in Antep and Derik. This was not a coincidence, it was done deliberately so that no one should say it was an accident. I take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in Antep and Derik and to our people, and wish a speedy recovery to the injured. The AKP-MHP government is killing people by accident, just like in Derik and Antep, they are killing people by saying “he was sick, he had an accident, he died” in the dungeons. Again, women are killed in many places. Here in Uludere, in Amed, women were brutally murdered. This is how they want to intimidate women and neutralize women’s movements. Massacres against women are not accidental.

**THE LIFE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO THE Kurds**

Again, as is known, there is a massacre of nature in Kurdistan. Trees are cut down. The geography of Kurdistan is being destroyed. They do not leave a living space to the Kurds. It’s not just about cutting trees. They are destroying all the lives of people, animals. They massacred people who were going on a picnic in Başur, they killed 4 children and injured 11 children in Hesekê a few days ago. All of these children are children who lost their parents in the ISIS attacks. The Turkish state is consciously avenging ISIS. Wherever we look, they attack everything in the name of the Kurds. Not only the PKK, but their targets are Kurds and Kurdistan.

The AKP-MHP government is entirely responsible for the massacre in Antep and Derik. These are massacres, not accidents. Our people should not accept those murderers when they come to their condolences, they should be fired. They will both slaughter our people everywhere, and they will come to offer their condolences, and our people will accept it. This is not true. This situation is incompatible with patriotism, humanity and moral values. In particular, Süleyman Soylu is killing our people every day, he declares it every day. He uses all weapons. He commits a massacre and then comes to our people, no one should accept it. The Turkish state commits crimes every day in Kurdistan. The people must rise up against it every day.

The women killed in Uludere and Amed are the cause of the uprising. Those killed in Hesekê and Iraq are the cause of the uprising. Again, the massacre of nature is the cause of rebellion. Those who fight for democracy and freedom should not accept these and rise up against it. If they revolt, the government cannot carry out such a policy. They pursue this policy because they think they are scaring and intimidating everyone. That’s why not everyone should make an individual account. Freedom, democracy and his country must be accounted for.

**The attacks of the genocidal Turkish army against Zap, Avaşîn and Metina continue. The guerrillas are also displaying an epic resistance against these attacks. It is stated that the Turkish army has used more than 1500 chemicals so far. The Turkish state also published a video showing that it used chemical weapons without realizing it. Despite this, they cannot break the resistance of the guerrilla. At what stage is the guerrilla resistance and the war now?**

Rêber Apo says that the greatest technique is human. Because he is the person who uses all the techniques. So it’s bigger than technique. We see very well what the leadership said in Zap, Avaşîn and Metina. The Turkish state uses all nuclear, phosphorus, thermobaric and chemical weapons, and reconnaissance planes fly dozens of times every day. They use tanks, cannons, missiles, whatever they have. NATO provides support, Barzani helps in every way, they also use gangs. But still no result. This shows that the guerrilla prepared itself against all the techniques of the Turkish state. That’s why it deals big blows to the Turkish state. The enemy had aimed to occupy all areas in a few weeks and to eliminate the guerrilla.

It is more than 4 months today, but they still cannot take a step forward, they are stuck in the face of the guerrilla. They are having many problems. They even bomb their funerals so that no one would understand. But they also make different propaganda among the people. They say that they have dealt a blow to the guerrilla and are waging a special war. Many soldiers die here, many of which they do not explain. They explain very little. In this way, they want to keep the people’s faith in them alive and they make politics over it. The guerrillas have the dead bodies of the soldiers, and the friends have revealed their names. They even revealed their tags for everyone to believe. They also called on the families to come and get your body. The Turkish state has fallen into this state. The reason why he used so many banned weapons and chemical weapons is because he lost against the guerrilla.

Congratulations to HPG and YJA Star guerrillas. They defend the dignity of the Kurdish people and humanity. They sacrifice their lives for this. They are loyal to Rêber Apo, the guerrilla and the martyrs, they are based on the philosophy and ideology of Rêber Apo, they are in love with the people, freedom, democracy and land. They put up a heroic resistance. Therefore, they are not only heroes of the Kurdish people, but also of humanity. Because they are fighting against fascism and genocide and they are giving their lives. That’s why everyone should band together around the guerrilla and scale up their actions. The entire burden should not be left to the guerrilla. They are already doing their job. Everyone must fight in every field with the spirit of guerrilla resistance. There are some actions now, but they are incomplete. There should be more activites.

**THE GUERILLA IS RESISTING RUDE DURING VERY HARD CONDITIONS**

Friends in Zap, Avaşîn and Metîna are struggling with great difficulties. Maybe they don’t eat for days, maybe they can’t take a bath for months, they have a gun in their hands, and they resist the enemy’s technique day and night. They deal big blows to the Turkish state. That’s why everyone should see this. Let the guerrilla fight under these conditions, let’s say, ‘We are their comrades, we depend on them’, but let’s not fulfill our duties. Then the opposite situation arises. This must be realized. The tactic of the guerrillas is a new tactic. That’s why it deals big blows to the Turkish state.

We don’t just say this, it is said by those who took part in the Turkish state’s special forces in the past. They confess that the guerrilla has renewed itself, has become very strong, and that we cannot achieve results in this way. This is real. Maybe some of us may exaggerate what we say, but the enemy himself admits that it is so. So there is no exaggeration here, there is truth. Everyone should see this and do their part. Once again, I congratulate the HPG and YJA Star guerrillas, they are doing great heroism. They are an example to the whole world. Everyone gets strength from it.

Guerrilla is currently carrying out tunnel and team tactics. As these complement each other, the Turkish state suffers a coup and fails to achieve results despite its techniques and tactics. That’s why they’re stuck. They don’t know how to get rid of it. That’s why they want to escalate the war in some places. But they don’t get any results either. Where they want to get rid of, they sink further, they receive more blows. That’s why a great war is being waged. This war will bring the end of AKP-MHP. The forces fighting against fascism should take this fact as the basis. They should see the guerrilla’s struggle as their own struggle and fulfill their duties.

**You mentioned how tough the war was. Guerrilla also announced its 4-month war balance sheet. According to the balance sheet, 1871 invaders were punished and 84 guerrillas were martyred. Tactical nuclear and chemical weapons were used 1532 times. How do you evaluate the final stage of the war?**

Our headquarters is already constantly releasing balance sheets. We can understand the extent of the war from these balance sheets. The Turkish state has suffered great blows in this war. The guerrilla also has a martyr. But when we compare, the loss of the guerrilla is not much compared to the war being waged. This is the result of the guerrilla’s struggle against the enemy’s technique. The guerrilla both inflicts few casualties and inflicts great blows on the enemy, thus nullifying his technique. The peoples who are fighting for freedom can draw many conclusions from the resistance in Zap, Avaşîn and Metîna. They shouldn’t fight like they used to, because they can’t get results that way. However, if they can draw conclusions from Zap, Avaşîn and Metina and train themselves, they will continue their struggle for democracy and freedom against the occupation very comfortably.

The situation is not the same as before, the capitalist system has developed technical and tactical changes. They especially developed against the guerrilla so that they would no longer be a freedom force. HPG and YJA Star guerrillas are also fighting against the enemy with new tactics. That’s why the Turkish state can’t get results despite the help of NATO, Barzani and the use of chemical weapons. The friends fighting in the Medya Defense Zones set an example not only for this movement or the Kurdish people, but for all humanity. Maybe they are carrying out this struggle under very difficult conditions, with impossibilities, but they are carrying out their struggle consciously. In other words, they know what they are doing for the PKK, for the people, for humanity. If they were not conscious, if there was no strong will and strong comrades, a strong struggle would not have been waged. No one could live in those areas even for a day.

Today, the guerrillas have been putting up a relentless resistance for more than 4 months. Rêber Apo’s philosophy and ideology are the basis of their heroic resistance in those impossibilities. The guerrilla heroically fulfills its duty. What is required of everyone is to understand the struggle of the guerrilla under those conditions and to fulfill their duty on this basis. We know how the guerrillas wage war against impossibilities. That’s why we think about how we can be worthy of those friends and how we can make the struggle bigger. Other than that, we have no other purpose. No matter what we do for those friends, we can’t pay our debt. Because they fulfill a historical duty for us, for our people, for humanity.

If the guerrillas are resisting heroically under those conditions, we need to fight more with that spirit and will outside. We have to be worthy of those friends. Friends should know that no matter what happens, we will pay our debt to them and we will fight on this basis. Friends should know this too, no matter how much propaganda the enemy makes, he has lost against the guerrilla and will lose even more. On this basis, I once again congratulate the YJA Star and HPG guerrillas and express my gratitude.

**After the NATO meeting, the Erdogan-Putin meeting took place. Immediately after, attacks against Kurds increased. How do you interpret these talks and the plans and policies of the sovereign powers?**

New members were accepted at the NATO meeting held in Spain. They fulfilled the demands of the Turkish state for the admission of these members. What are the demands of the Turkish state? NATO’s aid to Turkey was their support for the war they waged against the PKK, their non-opposition, and their demand for weapons. In other words, no matter what the Turkish state does, no one should oppose it. The Turkish state does not have the strength to fight against the PKK and commit genocide. This policy of genocide was developed in Lausanne, and the Turkish state carries out this policy. If the Turkish state insists on the policy of genocide and liquidation, NATO is behind it. My call to NATO; Do not be a partner in the genocide policy of the Turkish state. They should not conduct politics over Turkey and the Kurds. The Kurds are no longer the same as before, they have made the decision for freedom and paid the price for it.

A meeting was held in Tehran. Turkey demanded that both Russia and Iran accept their demands. So what are Turkey’s demands? The liquidation of the PKK, the genocide of the Kurdish people. Especially the occupation of new places in Rojava. They want to completely abolish Rojava’s status. AKP-MHP demanded this in Tehran, but it was not accepted. But this should not mean that nothing was agreed at the meeting. Some things are accepted. Some decisions were taken on the basis of Turkey’s re-establishing relations with Syria, the Syrian regime’s coming to power in Rojava, and the exchange of intelligence. But these are not Erdogan’s demands. So he went to Sochi and met with Putin. There he wanted more from Putin. “We will stand on Northern and Eastern Syria with Putin, we will work together,” Erdogan said on his return to Turkey. This description says it all.

In Sochi, Russia obviously made some promises. They promised that they would not close the airspace, and this is seen in practice. Because they do not even listen to the air attacks of the Turkish state. There are also intelligence exchanges. That’s why the Turkish state increased its attacks on Northern and Eastern Syria after Sochi. The occupation and attacks against Northern and Eastern Syria never stopped. If Russia had not paved the way for these attacks, the Turkish state could not have attacked. The Turkish state is killing children, women and the elderly every day.

Both America and Russia are responsible for these massacres. Our people in Rojava also say this, so they do not take a step back in the face of attacks. They say, “Whatever the cost, we will not leave our lands, we will resist until the end.” That is what is true. For our people, there is no other way but resistance. But they can live with resistance. These forces have given our people nothing but massacre, exile, immigration and demographic change. Unless a change is made in the genocidal policy they developed in Lausanne, the massacres against the Kurds will continue. Our people should know this well. Our people must believe in themselves first of all. One should not expect anything from anyone.

**KURDISH PEOPLE SHOULD NOT LEFT THEIR LAND**

Turkey wants to establish relations with the Syrian regime, but this is not something to be comfortable with. There are huge problems. There is a government supported by the Turkish state in Idlib. Again, the Turkish state has occupied many places and set up a fake army consisting of thousands of mercenaries. How will these be? Another important point is: A female minister of Erdogan came out and said, “We consciously attracted the Syrian people to Turkey. Because we had a purpose, we brought millions of people to fulfill it. We took advantage of them, we got money from the EU, we worked cheap in Turkey and made big profits, we brought all the factories in Syria to Turkey, we formed an army from the gangs among them and use them everywhere, and now we want to resettle them in Syria. As well as to the regions of the Kurds.” He clearly said this. The EU and the US have been paying the Turkish state for refugees for years. In other words, they support Turkey’s genocide policy. They have been serving this for years.

The people and fighters of Rojava fought against ISIS and dealt a great blow to the gangs. They saved humanity from great trouble. Humanity owes it to Rojava and the Kurdish people. But the Turkish state is killing those people every day. They martyred the children of those who fought against ISIS gangs and lost their lives at school. The EU and America need to see this. In this sense, it should not give material and moral support to the Turkish state and should not be a partner in the genocide. Our people should also know that a very dirty policy is being carried out against them. They want to evacuate the villages and migrate the people. That’s why they attack the villages. No matter what the cost, no one should leave their village. If they leave, the Turkish state will achieve its goal.

Again, their cadres aim to weaken the movement by removing the administration. They are using this tactic right now. In other words, they want to weaken both the people and the military power. They want Erdogan to stay in power by murdering the Kurds . Our people should not forget this and should prepare themselves in every way. Whoever is hostile must fight against him. That is the correct one.",wyysga,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/wyysga/bayık_claiming_rêber_apo_is_protecting_freedom/,[]

### RÊBER APO – From the book “To insist on socialism is to insist on humanity”

*“(…) it is necessary that the socialist model be developed more. This model is the model of human development. In my opinion, you can check everything with this model. You can check the population increase. We can use it to convince the society. Capitalism does not build society, it misleads society, it uses and wastes it. But socialism is not like that. It believes in it and does everything of its own free will. This is a great danger. (…) A strange, wasteful and consumerist society has been developed. Everyone wants to eat more and waste even more. They are already almost consumer monsters. In the future, all will become consumption monsters, a world without consumption will no longer exist and they will eat each other. Correct, however, with the model of scientific socialism, nature is not destroyed, nor is society reckless.”*

A housing plan can be made. The economy can be balanced. Socialism today means the fight against the destruction of nature, the enslavement of society by the media and many diseases. But surely the concept of 19th century socialism is not enough. They were always tough and said, “Against classes, against exploitation, national liberation.” This is also a little NEEDED, but in reality what is emerging and being developed is democratic socialism. Against the destruction of the environment and the brutality of consumption, the development of the struggle is taken seriously. This can be a new program of socialism. Such a program will be the clearest expression of socialism and the salvation of humanity itself.

In this sense, socialism is the only future of humanity. In the past, this was called socialization (or sociality). We now call it socialism. Animalism (behaving like an animal) begins when socialization (sociality) ceases. Under the conditions of capitalism the most dangerous monsters grow up. Therefore, socialist struggle is the main way of liberation in this phase of capitalist-imperialist era. There is no condition that does not occur! If this rampant animalism is not stopped, humanity will end.

In this sense I say: **TO BECOME SOCIALISt IS TO BECOME HUMAN!**

Certainly, the collapse of structural socialism has not reduced the problems of capitalism or does not mean its success, as is claimed. On the contrary, it is confronted with even more problems that have depressed it and from which it cannot get out. It can be said that in the present period no way has been paved, the present capitalism shows signs of decay. The most well-meaning commentator may say that history is at a standstill.

Some may say that; “The endless triumph of capitalism.” However, all reasons indicate that it must be accepted as a never-ending approaching catastrophe. The truth is this: It has put humanity on an unprecedented consumption cycle. It is proceeding at such a runaway pace that it cannot sustain itself and it is not clear where it will end. This is the basis of fear and pessimism. In general, all the oppressive classes and exploiters, especially the most greedy and merciless classes that actually change their clothes, that rely on the capitalist system of bourgoisie, are in a situation in our time that is not necessary at all, but has become so much the scourge of society.

For the October Revolution, it can be said that this revolution was born early. That is why it went through severe illnesses and paved the way for a form of socialism that could not save itself from collapse. We can say the same for the revolutions that have taken place in the most ancient periods of history. In every major uprising or revolution, the class that defines the most leftist and radical tendency of the revolutionary government becomes the class that works the most under the lowest and most difficult conditions.

Slaves, servents and workers are changed by some conditions, the working classes have changed their color. We know that the ruling classes have also changed their colors until today. **What capitalism-imperialism has succeeded in doing is to pretend, to put them in a situation where they cannot fight, and for this it wages a psychological, ideological and cultural war that is highly institutionalized.**

They also use and expand the technical development in the field of press and broadcasting very well. They keep the society under such a information bombardment that it cannot take care of itself and govern itself that way. (…) If nowadays we cannot speak of classes with clear and well-defined boundaries, this is one of the main reasons.

Yes indeed, the very phenomenon of labor and the class that draws its source from it is certainly the same, even if its content and form has changed. But in general, it needs a good definition for the dominant exploitative class, which keeps changing its color and, in a sense, generalizing. Definitions of the old class like slaveholders, landowners, factory owners are not enough.

Definitions like middle class, petty bourgeoisie, bourgeoisie etc., are also insufficient. If we want to understand socialism well, it is necessary to deal with the definitions of class differences and everyday reality and to act like that. (…). The false methods of pressure have given way to the ideological and deceptive ones and have deepened the mess.

The so-called empire of social media, the media and broadcasting monopolies manage the society more dangerously than the most powerful rulers. The place of technology in production has evolved somewhat. Instead of the previous manual labor – although it still depends on this basis – they have put production in the hands of the managers of the new technology, making manual labor ineffective. In other words, the aspects of labor that rely on the hands and arms of the working person have been greatly weakened.

You can even say, with the revolution of science and technology developed by the current monopolies, they tell people; “You are too much and unnecessary.” High unemployment has been created, partly due to this feature of capitalism. The few that remain is the bourgeoisie who declare society unnecessary.

What is really unnecessary is the current capitalism itself. But unfortunately, because of their dominance, their managements and their influential tools, they tell society; “You are unnecessary” and get elected. (…) Humanity is cut down both in the spiritual and physical sense. The basic concerns of human life are destroyed, aesthetics are destroyed, the lines of religion and philosophy are destroyed.

**A situation where humanity has become blind, alien, a group of people become a real danger like snakes. The system that establishes this is global capitalism.** They need a new ideology and a basic idea. Socialism, which stood against it with conviction, has not lived sufficiently.

(…) Yes, this is indeed the real field to discuss and explore. To protect the current capitalism means to accept the death for the humanity, to destroy its future, in a situation as brutal as not stable, that puts it in a bad condemnation. The brutality of current social consumption makes it easy to make such a definition.

**IF HUMANITY IS TO SURVIVE, THIS CURRENT SITUATION IS UNACCEPTABLE.**

In all fundamental revolutions, every movement that the working class leads and supports, some of them have socialist content or have prepared for socialism. (…) It can be seen: as far as the history of mankind is concerned, the struggle of socialism and communism is also a reality. Many wrong approaches, for example, evaluation errors, made their movement a dominant movement in a short time, a successful movement on a global scale. Some of them appeared in the form of evaluations of the last prophet, the last religion, and the last word.

As social development progresses, the statement of each important stage of truth is passed on according to the new developments. Let it be the last word, it remains the old saying. But this does not mean that the words that have been said have no meaning or importance. After all, according to its time, Islam has replaced bourgeois liberalism and socialism and advanced important developments. They have left important legacies to history. In this sense, it has certainly not been empty. Social progress and freedom are partly due to these struggles.

Not to mention the struggle for socialism, the name of the most fundamental development in this matter. All developments are based on work, production and creativity, and above all they have progressed towards humanity in the light of this ideology. We can say that in our time we are experiencing a broad wave and crisis. Capitalism claims to be a universal and worldwide system.

They had this claim before. As a result of the shortcomings of the implemented socialism itself and its destruction gave the opportunity to become even stronger in this claim. However, as said, the opposite of this claim is also possible. The ever more serious crisis brings out more and more the necessity of socialism. To be without socialism is to be without air.

(…) The solution lies again in the social reality, its socialist aspect. But what kind of socialism?

Whether theoretical or structural, socialism must be strengthened. As much as it is necessary to take into account and overcome the shortcomings in its history, it is also necessary to evaluate the complex and comprehensive crisis that we are experiencing in our time and to force its strength to solve it. (…)”

452,Seeing the guerrilla in the spring - from a guerrilla diary,"[SOURCE](https://www.nuceciwan111.xyz/en/2022/08/24/seeing-the-guerrilla-in-the-spring/)

https://preview.redd.it/b1pglq2xsoj91.jpg?width=5184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c4cb247e77933f143f84735bd3b3f1012bceeacc

The classical answer in my heart, which has been listening to the words “Let a spring come, let the sun rise…” every day for five months, is “you see me then”. This saying has been said for many years and is among the indispensable classics in the guerrilla environment.

“Spring come, let the sun rise; You see me then.” My brain has been deepening in the meaning of these words, which I hear almost every day in the camp where I am in the camp, which float from mountain to mountain, from language to language. What will happen when spring comes? What about when the sun rises? Why do the owners of these words think that appearing at that moment would have another meaning?

In these days when the mountains of Kurdistan are getting ready for spring, my brain is bombarded with questions by the words of the guerrilla, who constantly tempt me.

**THE MOMENT OF THE GUERILLA’S FOOT VOICES**

Spring is a symbol of renewal. The festival of resistance and resurrection among the Kurds. The moment of the guerrilla leaving the winter training camps. The rising sun, the protector. The symbol of holiness among the Kurds, who express themselves as children of the sun. As long as the sun shines on the mountains of Kurdistan, the Kurdistan freedom guerrilla will fight, resist and live. “You see me then.” 

After the sun rises in the mountains of Kurdistan with the spring, the moment of fighting with the enemy on the battlefield after an in-depth training seen in the winter training camps of the guerrilla. In the words of a presenter in the news bulletins, “dengê lingê gerîla tê (guerrilla footsteps are coming). This is the time. While the guerrilla, who wants to appear in the spring, wants to show his Leader, his party, and his people how spiritually and intellectually he came out of the winter retreat reserved for him, he also wants to convey to his enemy the message that “the elimination of the invasion, occupation and destruction plans that revived during the winter in my absence depends on my existence”.

**THE HEART OF THE GUERILLA LIVES SPRING IN WINTER**

We are in the underground winter camp at a depth of 10 meters in the Herekol mountains at an altitude of 2962 meters. The snow that has fallen throughout the winter has closed almost all the entrances and exits of our quiche, not only outside, but seeping through every hole it finds. The snow that seeps in is a reflection of the outside air and image. In other words, all the cliffs of Herekol are covered in white from the snow outside. Despite the snowy weather outside, the heart of every guerrilla in the winter camp is spring. The first cemre has already fallen. He whispered in our ears the good news of leaves and flowers, which will be buds ready to burst. Even though the sun is far from the Herekol mountains, it announced its dominance over the Mesopotamian geography that will continue from now on. Even though the season looks winter in the Herekol mountains, the heart of each guerrilla in it is experiencing spring. 

**A SEPARATE EXCITEMENT HAS GROWED SHINDAR**

One of the guerrillas who miss the spring the most, Şîndar has recently been surrounded by a different excitement and rush. He has been preparing for spring for a week. He rushes here and there to complete the missing materials. While he is running, he does not hesitate to put each of his comrades in the women’s squad into action. Shindar, who came from the Southern mountains of Kurdistan to the Northern field last year, is not very good at sewing. His job is just to tell what’s missing and to get the materials needed to make up for that deficiency and bring it to the squad. Afterwards, while Nûdem was telling the project and how it should be done, Rahime had already taken the needle and thread and started to sew what she wanted. While Arîn offers her support whenever she has the opportunity, Zerdeşt, who is an expert in sewing, does not hesitate to lend a helping hand. While his friends struggle for Shindar. 

Shindar is eager to understand and immediately participate in the life and warfare of the Northern field. Although he often complains that he is insufficient in expressing his excitement and desire to participate actively and strongly in the war, his mobility in life is the clearest expression of this desire. Having dreams of being a guerrilla in the mountains of Botan from an early age, Botanlı Şîndar is now striving with all his might to be worthy of his party, which realizes these dreams. On the one hand, he concentrates on his health work, which is his branch, on the other hand, he experiences the excitement of being mentally and physically ready for the warmest areas of war.

Guerrilla Shindar, who relentlessly repeats the words “Let spring come, let the sun rise, see me then” every day, is now preparing for spring activities. I don’t think any force can hold him back.

""Unless the logic of nation-statism is overcome, no project can save the Middle East from its deep depressions and problems, and prevent it from conflicts and wars."" - Abudllah Ocalan"," [SOURCE](https://www.nuceciwan111.xyz/en/2022/08/18/how-might-the-middle-east-wars-end/)

https://preview.redd.it/n87wt6i91ji91.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc4b32235ed577d5dbe84fbce872539be0e43457

“I hesitate to use the terms crisis and chaos frequently for the region. If the reality is hot war, then it would be misleading to reduce it to crisis and chaos. Undoubtedly, today’s wars are not similar to the wars of the first and medieval times, nor to the forms of warfare that modernity sustained until the two world wars. Especially with the First and Second World Wars, wars became massive. After the Second World War, it became socialized. It is a requirement of its new essence to understand that the era of wars in the three-legged monster march of modernity, with their internal and external distinctions, is over, and that the new era of modernity means that internal and external wars are waged together within the society. In general, the reality of war in the entire Middle East society, in particular, Palestine-Israel, in its most obvious form. It is of great importance to analyze the reality of the Afghanistan-Pakistan and Iran-Iraq wars in this context. Incredible events and processes will be made more understandable with the analyzes in this scope.

How can the new Middle East wars waged under US-EU hegemony end? Will they become more widespread and intensified? Can hegemonic powers leave the region? What to expect if they do or not? Clearly, these fundamental questions cannot be given clear and definite answers. But it is certain that we are dealing with a different historical stage.

**UNLESS THE LOGIC OF NATION STATISTICS IS EXCEEDED**

The Greater Middle East Project, which the USA wants to put on the agenda, has little chance of success. In fact, this project is based on nation-states. Many similar projects have pushed the Middle East into more confusion. The situations caused by the last project were no different. Unless the logic of nation-statism is overcome, no project can save the Middle East from its deep depressions and problems, and prevent it from conflicts and wars. Since both the existing Arab League and the Islamic Conference organizations were crippled by the same nation-state logic, they did not have a resolving role in any problem. Unless they overcome their current mentality and structuring, they cannot have a chance for a solution.

**SHARE EXTRACTING ACCOUNTS OF TURKEY AND IRAN**

In addition, the influence wars waged by both Iran and Turkey through Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda against the USA and the local hegemonic power Israel can only play a role in making the problems more intractable. Share breakout accounts can also backfire at any time. The situation that all these old and new nation-state games brought to the Middle East is in front of the eyes. This situation of the Middle East, which has grown into a tangle of problems under the name of “We solve problems, we practice zero-problem diplomacy”, is structural as we have clearly demonstrated, and this stems from nation-statism.

As we have clearly stated, the democratic nation mentality and democratic autonomy structuring of democratic modernity is the most appropriate egalitarian, libertarian and democratic model and new paradigm for getting out of this chaotic situation. It is a model that shows everyone and every society the way to lasting peace and security.

**RADICAL OR MODERATE ISLAM DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE A SYSTEM**

The attack of the last two centuries (Napoleon started this attack, Britain developed it, USA continues) is still going on. Especially today, hot and cold wars continue in many regions from Afghanistan to Morocco, from the Caucasus to Central Africa. It is the weakest state of the existing system. More precisely, the weakest link of Western modernity is the traditional Middle East. Triangle has been tried to be established in the last two centuries, but it has not played a role other than deepening the chaos.

Collaborators of modernity with an Islamic veneer, whether radical or moderate, became the spice of the new chaotic situation. They have the capacity to be a system neither as Islam nor otherwise. Although there are situations beyond anarchy and chaos in the region, it cannot be said that successful exits have come into play. What can be said is that the chaotic situation is constantly boiling. Every boiling is worth creating new alloys and compounds. One of the possibilities that will arise from this fusion may be an original East-West synthesis. It is not possible for the East to revive one of its ancient forms of civilization, nor for the West to unilaterally inject its own modernity. The originality of the synthesis will be determined by the ability of scientific structures and organizational movements to respond to social problems.

It is the weakest possibility for the parties to exit by denying each other. It has become clear enough that new outlets cannot be achieved with orientalism in Western science. The science of the social nature of the East awaits only its pioneers. The desired output can be achieved through the production, organization, mobilization and socialization of this science.

**WHETHER NATIONAL OR RELIGIOUS, ALL ARE AGENT**

The level of political crises in other Middle Eastern countries, particularly Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria-Lebanon, Israel-Palestine, confirms our approach. It is clear that all the built states of the region, large and small, whether in the name of nationalism or religion, play no more than the role of stale agents and extras of capitalist modernity. Looking at their short histories, it will not be difficult to understand that the nationalist and Islamist states are the fabrications of imperialism of the last two centuries. Because they are hegemonic products and because of the terror they spread through the formation of ‘freak citizens’, the true faces of these states could not be understood.

It is not possible to show any other area that hides the role of agent-surface as much as the power and nation-state powers in the Middle East. Thousands of years of experience and ideological hegemony gained in power and state games have a very important role in this. Those who observe the depth of the power and state crises in Afghanistan, Iraq and Israel-Palestine may find the situation strange. However, this reality only shows and proves that the crisis and the chaotic situation have an important aspect related to the collapse of civilization as much as the depth of the historical basis. Not only are the nation-states of the last two centuries dissolved, but the five thousand-year-old civilizational power tradition is also collapsing.

The power and state crises in the Middle East can only be comprehended if they are resolved on the basis of civilization. The last two centuries’ veneer of capitalist modernity should not ignore the crisis of civilization. Moreover, modernity itself has revealed its chaotic features with all its clarity with its practices in the Middle East. There is no other experience that makes capitalism a crisis regime as instructive as its applications in the field.

**THE Dominant POWERS HAVE NO SOLUTION**

When we look at it from this basic perspective, the first thing that can be said about the contemporary is that neither the traditional nor the modern dominant powers can offer a solution to the social problem in general, and to get out of the crisis and chaos in particular. Of course, the forces that are the source of problems and crises cannot be solution forces. Whether in the name of religion or nationalism, a solution cannot be found by taking refuge in traditional history. Because the history of these forces is also the history of insolvency. What ancient glorious civilization could be revived? Even if Islam and the Ottomans can be resurrected, this resurrection will probably be achieved under the strict protection and medicine of the USA, with its miraculous power, which will be another Islam and Ottoman Empire.

Nor do modern powers have solutions to offer. How can they be the solution when they are the builders of the most problematic and frequently crisis system? While the current financial crisis cannot find a way out with its global and structural dimensions, what solution can it offer to the problems and crises such as the Middle East, whose foundations extend beyond centuries and which modernity has made even more intractable? A system that exploits ten times the current world production (approximately $600 trillion per year) just by playing with virtual cards and numbers can only open the way to hell, not the solution.

The great chaos experienced in the mother country and region of the central civilization reveals the bankruptcy of nation-statism and power sharing with all its aspects and with all its nakedness. This chaos has unmasked the Palestinian-Israeli, Iraqi and Afghan nation-states and the rulingism based on the most advanced hierarchies, making it clear that they constitute the main source of the problems, and revealing in every aspect that unlimited violence, terror, wars and massacres are fed from this source. It has been sufficiently proven that nation-statism and power-sharing are incapable of hitting their owners like boomerangs.

As for the ‘Third World War’ issue, it is sufficient to understand the reality of this war that the balance sheet of what happened in certain countries, especially Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Turkey, Yemen, Somalia and Egypt, has already exceeded the balance sheets of the First and Second World Wars in many ways. It is an understandable issue that the ‘Third World War’ will be fragmented, spread over a long period of time and will be carried out with different technologies due to nuclear weapons. NATO’s last Lisbon Summit provides the necessary information about the deepening of the US blockade around Iran and the course of the ‘Third World War’.

**THE HEART OF THE 3rd WORLD WAR IS THE MIDDLE EAST**

The ‘Third World War’ is a reality and its center of gravity is the geography and cultural environment of the Middle East. Even what happened in Iraq, the center of intensity of the ‘Third World War’, explains very well that the war here is not about a country, but about the interests and existence of the world hegemonic powers. This war can only be ended if Iran is completely neutralized, Afghanistan and Iraq are stabilized, and China and Latin America are no longer a threat. So we are in the middle of the war. While it is not true from a social science point of view to say anything definitive, the war may continue for at least ten years (NATO’s latest strategic plans also foresee a period of ten years). Sometimes diplomacy, sometimes violence will intensify. The agenda will be intervened with severe and controlled economic crises. The priority of the areas will change, but one way or another, the war will take place in many areas as a whole. But given this fundamental nature of the war, it will become clearer why the 1998 operation against me was conducted internationally and is NATO’s largest Gladio operation. Undoubtedly, hegemonic powers do not always win in great wars, and peoples can gain a lot. Even hegemonic powers may lose systematically, and peoples may gain systemically.

**NATION STATE BREAKS DEFINITION AND WAR**

One of the biggest disasters of the nation-statism impasse is experienced on the Afghanistan-Pakistan line today. In addition, the Kashmir problem experienced in connection with this is entirely due to nation-statism. Pakistan-India, Pakistan-Bangladesh problems were experienced as a result of the same nationalist minds, they are still being lived. By their very nature, nation-state solutions and peace breed deadlock and war. These concrete examples are quite revealing of this fact. It was desired to apply both republican, royalist and real socialist models of nation-statism to Afghanistan. The result is a disintegrated Afghan society that has lost its ability to sustain itself, in an environment of blind violence that has gone out of hand and has no principles.

Apart from the democratic nation theory and concepts, it is unthinkable to think of any other mentality and will that will regroup these societies and lead them to a more free and democratic life. Social problems cannot be solved structurally unless they are solved mentally. The democratic nation mentality constitutes the most appropriate integrative framework for a wide variety of cultures and peoples, from Central Asia to India. Moreover, the cultures and peoples in these places have been able to maintain their existence and originality, although not ideal, by living under common political roofs and empires of the confederal type throughout history.

Whether in the form of religious or secular nationalism, as the nation-statist mentality continues, further dissolution and conflicts of these societies are inevitable. By presenting Islam, which they claim to be strongly attached to, as an ideology of terror, they also highly negate this tradition. For these large geographies, as for Iran, it is necessary to develop democratic national unity throughout the Middle East in a way that is intertwined with it. The most appropriate alternative to the intense disintegration that nation-states such as Pakistan are already experiencing is a Democratic National Unity project to be developed across the Middle East.

**THE DEMOCRATIC NATION SOLUTION AND CONFEDERAL GOVERNMENTS** 

Problems are being tried to be resolved with three or more nation-states instead of one nation-state in Iraq, three states in Palestine, and statelets as many as the number of tribes in Afghanistan. Adding new power and state elites, which are already burdensome enough, will only result in more oppression and exploitation. This means more social problems and conflicts. If the Kurdistan Revolution institutionalizes the democratic nation solution with the establishment of confederal governments and democratic authority, this model may lead to radical transformations in solving the thousands of years old power knots and statism diseases of the Middle East. What the peoples and cultures of the Middle East desperately need is democratic authority. Apart from this, every solution move based on the test of power and state power, as observed in all the examples tried so far,

Although the Western hegemony did not show the power to institutionalize itself in the Middle East, it at least managed to connect the region to its system with minimalist nation-states. The stage reached is the bankruptcy of this method. The institutions that the Kurdistan Revolution will produce and build in democratic nation dimensions may reverse this tradition. It can develop the Democratic League of Nations on the basis of shared cultures in history. The democratic elements of Middle Eastern cultures should not be underestimated. If the still strong tribal and tribal traditions and the religious and sectarian tradition of community are integrated with the principles and institutions of democratic nationhood, it can be transformed into the power of democratization. It should not be forgotten that the more valid the despotic power is, the more necessary is the need for democracy and it can be realized. Wherever power is strong, democracy also has great potential power. It has become very clear that the Middle East cannot be governed by the current understanding of nation and power.

**THE SOLUTION: DEMOCRATIC INTERNATIONAL UNION**

In the solution of national and regional problems, the framework of the Democratic Nations Union needs to be established immediately. While it is clear that no single state can cope with the growing problems, escaping from unity is synonymous with unpretentiousness and insolubility. The nation-stateization of Kurdistan cannot be described as a revolutionary development for the Kurds. A much more serious problem would only be added to the severe regional problems. The Kurdish nation-state tried in Iraq can only play a positive role in Kurdistan and the Middle East if it is surrounded by democratic nationhood and is made a conciliatory backup for this process. Otherwise, it can be expected to cause more serious problems than the Israeli-Palestinian one.

The solution imposed by the democratic nation model does not require the denial of nation-states, but their commitment to the democratic constitutional solution. The intertwined state-democracy union is not the only solution model in Western Europe. On the contrary, it is a model that has many problems and delays its solution. The model that should be tried in the Middle East is the democratic constitutional solution based on the existence and autonomy of the state-nation and the democratic nation. Otherwise, the unity models that will emerge will not go beyond the formations such as the Islamic Conference and the Arab League (to include the Council of Turkic States) in terms of their roles. The Democratic Union of Nations, which will be formed among the nations that are internally dependent on the democratic constitutional system (the concept of nation here means the supreme nation or nation of nations arising from the reconciliation of the state-nation and the democratic nation) will undoubtedly be a great development. It will mean not only the establishment of lasting peace, but also the economic productivity and cultural renaissance of the masses, completely freed from unemployment, with the coexistence of the communal economy and ecological industry.

No one can see unemployment, inefficient economy and unpromising cultural life in the region as destiny in the current age of information and technology. Those who see it this way are those who are in ideological blindness or who experience the ideological hegemony of the system. Only under the umbrella of the Democratic League of Nations can the Middle East re-play its universal role, which has been so long in history. As I always say, the Kurds can play the same role they played at the dawn of civilization, this time on the basis of democratic civilization. The potential of the Kurdistan Revolution and the Kurdish democratic nation solution provides all the necessary power (intellectual and physical strength) for this. The Kurdistan Revolution is more than ever a Middle Eastern Revolution. Kurdish democratic nationhood is the Middle East Democratic Nations Union.

In that case, the path of the Kurdistan Revolution to universality will pass through the Democratic Union of Nations in the Middle East. Many regional unions (nation-state associations in Europe, Asia, America and Africa) and the UN, based on nation-state units of capitalist modernity, have not been able to find a solution to any global and regional problems since their establishment. Because the inherent insolvency, problem development and postponement capacity of the nation-state is more than valid for such regional unions and UN units.

**REGIONAL DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL UNIONS**

Instead of these unsuccessful examples, the creation of new units with units that exceed nation-state units is an undeferred need. Just as there is a need for Regional Democratic National Unions, there is a strong need for the World Union of Democratic Nations (DUB), which consists of democratic national units that transcend nation-states instead of the current UN. Whether we think regionally or globally, the Democratic League of Nations should be a union of not only state units but also democratic non-governmental organizations. World peace cannot be achieved with nation-states, which are the source of war. At the same time, development cannot be achieved with the institutions of modernity, which are the source of crises. Existing examples amply prove this fact. As world peace passes through democratic nations.”

Last night, announcements were made over mosque intercoms in Gaziantep region near the Syrian border stating “The Turkish Army will soon carry out an operation against the terrorist organization PKK. Please do not leave your homes.” This was followed by an immediate investigation launched by the Turkish state to identify who was responsible for these announcements, which seemed to be the mayor of Gaziantep.

SDF intelligence refuted the announcements soon after, stating that there had been no troop movements observed and that there was no indication of an imminent invasion. This is yet just another strategy of the fascist turkish state of physiological warfare trying to create fear in the population and measure the reflects of the SDF and the people of AANES. This refutation was shared even by Levant Front of the Turkish-backed SNA, who also confirmed that no operation had begun. Clashes south of Tel Abyad/Serekaniye last night were unrelated.

Reports of Turkish troop movements were almost exclusively sourced from Turkish outlets without any evidence, then disseminated throughout the OSINT realm. This appears to have been an act of psychological warfare, as the Turkish state has halted its invasion plans indefinitely.

*As an internationalist in the Rojava revolution I get to work close to the people. I get to know lot of them and to hear lot of stories. During my whole life I have been influenced by the curse of History. As a South-American my identity as been distorted by the event of the 70s, by the print of the colonization, by the fascism of Neo-liberal politics etc. I have lived myself through painful events that are hard to describe and to make understand to someone who have always leaved far away from History storms. Here in the heart of Middle-East I had to experience some events myself but mostly to testify stories of others. History is made by individuals and History make individuals. Truth have to be told, truth have to be heard. In this revolution we all have a role to play. Our inaction, our passivity, our blindness is a crime. Right now my role is to be the messenger of this truth, to share with you what I see and what I hear. Those are the prints of the war in Rojava this is the reality.* 

**“Hanif”**

My name is Hanif I am 20 years old. I am Kurdish and I have always lived in a small village in Syria near the city of Kobane. A few years ago my family and I had to flee our village, because of the Islamic State gangs. My mother, my two little sisters, my little brother and I left in a hurry when we heard that the neighbouring village was being looted by Daesh My father stayed behind and was to join us later with a neighbour with the few things we had. At that time I was still too young to face the war, I didn’t understand what it meant and the influence that war can have on people’s lives. My father never joined us, he was captured by Daesh and then he disappeared just like our neighbour. I think they killed him and then buried him in a mass grave as they have done dozens of times with hundreds of us. This happened at the very beginning of the battle for Kobane in 2014. A few months later when Kobane was liberated by the hevals we went back home. Luckily our village escaped the fighting and our house was still standing even though it had been looted from top to bottom. We had to rebuild the whole electrical system and fill some holes. Thanks to the resistance, thanks to the martyrs, thanks to the self-defense forces, but especially thanks to Serok Apo who taught us to resist, to organize and to live with our heads held high, my mother was able to get her house back. We had the courage and luck to escape the fate of refugees that thousands of Syrians are going through right now.

When our house was ready I wanted to join the YPG to protect our land. I was too young at that time. The hevals did not accept me. Some months later I went back and told them about my father’s story and my determination to join our self-defense forces. This time, at my insistence (I can be a milestone anytime I want) the hevals were willing to take me under their wings and give me a job, but it was out of the question for me to go to the front.

Then when I was finally old enough, I quickly applied to join the YAT, the unit specialized in intervention against Daesh terrorists. I participated in several operations where we arrested or eliminated hundreds of their gang cells. I am proud to belong to this elite unit, it is for me the best revenge I could take on the terrorists. But in my family I am not the only one. My mother is part of the self-administration structure and my sister is part of the young women’s movement.

A few months ago my little brother, who was bubbling with the same need to defend our land, decided to join the PKK. His choice is much more radical than mine even if it doesn’t necessarily mean that he will go to fight. He was more courageous than me. He left everything even his home and family to give his whole life to the revolution. Even if I miss him I am very proud of him. And thanks to his commitment today everyone knows my family and greets us in the street. It is a big proud for us.

**“Dicle”**

My father was killed in front of my eyes during the massacre in Kobane committed by Daesh terrorists. They infiltrated the city using YPG uniforms and massacred several hundred civilians. They broke down the door of my house and shot my father in the head, and then placed a grenade under his clothes to destroy his body. Fortunately my father sensed that something was wrong. Before they broke down the door he had time to hide me behind some blankets in the bedroom. Since that day I promised myself to do everything in my power to defend the peace of my people. Today and for several years I have been an activist of the revolutionary youth. I have found a new breath, a way to transform my grief and hatred into something positive. Today I have responsibilities and I am active in the movement.

Thanks to PKK cadres I was convinced to give meaning to my life rather than to resign my pain. One of them became a very close friend, a kind of big sister, a confidante. She fell as a martyr, during a drone attack. We were in political training, a week of classes and discussions to better understand the meaning of the revolution we are working hard to make happen. It was my turn to cook for all the classmates of the academy. Shehid Viyan and some of my comrades were siting in the garden drinking tea while waiting. A Turkish drone dropped a several thousand dollars rocket loaded with explosives and metal balls. The windows exploded, I get afraid like never before. When I went to look in the garden I did not recognize the bodies of my comrades, I could not believe it was them. As the day my father was murdered there was nothing left.

Once again I promised myself that I would never abandon our cause, never abandon the humanity that is in me. Today I am taking care of my mother who is sick. When she will be gone, I will also join the PKK.

**“Cihan”**

My name is Cihan I am 12 years old and I live in Kobane with my family. We are what the movement calls welatparez (NdT: defenders of the land). We have been close to the party for many generations. My grandparents met Abdullah Ocalan and went to see him several times in Lebanon or here in Syria. My father worked in the training camps in the Bekaa with the guerrillas who were training. Two of my uncles were martyred during the war against Daesh here in Syria. My aunt was martyred in the mountains with the guerilla. My aunt and uncles are the pride of our family, they are real heroes and I admire them. One day I will join the party too, I have already told my family. Of course my parents think that I will change my mind and they try to make the hevals believe that I am too young so that I can stay longer with them. But my choice has been made for years. I know that one day I will go to the mountains and I too will be a PKK revolutionary. I will walk on the steps of my aunt it is the promises I did to her and to my people.

**“Fatma”**

My name is Fatma, I am the mother of 10 children and live in Kobane. My family was not close to the Apocis. My father always preferred Barzani and the peshmerga to Reber Apo’s guerilla. Anyway, when the Islamist wave threatened the city in 2014, we left like all the people of Kobane. We left for Turkey where we thought we would be welcomed and helped. Instead we were persecuted by the authorities as if we were the terrorists. As soon as we were able to return home, we crossed the border again. Our house and the whole neighbourhood had been razed by bombs. We rebuilt. While we were rebuilding our home my daughter (the oldest of my children) stayed in Bakur (Northern Kurdistan) to work and send us money for the house. She was arrested by the Turkish police. Today she has been imprisoned for 5 years waiting for her trial. No charges, no court, they just threw her in jail accusing her of being a member of the PKK. They even cheated us out of our few savings by promising us a trial if we gave them money. Today my husband and I are struggling to provide for our children. Fortunately I have a son who joined the YPG and he helps us with his pay. He says he doesn’t need the money because he doesn’t plan to leave the Self Defense Forces until the war is over.

**“Abet”**

My name is Abet and I am a father of three children. I am originally from Afrin but now I live in Kobane with my family. I have always lived in Afrin but when the Turkish forces invaded the region and the Daesh elders turned into mercenaries for the Turkish state we had to leave our land. My wife and children went to live in a refugee camp for a while. I stayed to fight and resist the Ottoman invader and his jihadist henchmen.

Many of my childhood friends and other comrades from all over died before my eyes. We buried with our own hands between the roots of my ancestors’ olive trees. After the air raids and our retreat that continues to burn my heart every day of my life the occupation began. I joined my family and we moved to a village near the city of Kobane. The occupiers dig up my comrades bodies, and they accused us of mass murder, saying that those bodies were killes by us.

Today I work for the village municipality and my wife is a member of the regional council. I am also a member of the civil self-defense forces. Even though I am not a military man anymore, if the war comes to us again I am ready to fight once more. For the future of my children, for the memory of my comrades, for the land of my parents, I am ready to give my life and everything I have. This time I will not make a step backward.

**“Alime”**

My name is Alime. I am the mother of 3 children. My sister was a guerrilla cadre and she fell as a martyr in the mountains during clashes with the Turkish military. My brother was a YPG fighter, but he was martyred during the massacre of Kobane when Daesh gangs infiltrated the city to massacre civilians, it was during one of his weeks of leave. He came back from the front to see us on that day…Today I am in charge of the popular defense forces in my town. We are civilians who take in hands the defense of our houses and our districts. I know how to handle a weapon and command a small group of fighters. But I am not a military person. Just a mother who cares about the security of her family and neighbours. Today I train young and old in defense, but I also give classes to make people understand why it is necessary for us as civilians to do our part in this war. Because in this war civilians are the first victims, the weapon of the enemy do not make any difference between civilians and soldiers.",wiijri,21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/wiijri/prints_of_war_incredible_stories_collected_from_a/,[]

The Diplomacy Committee of the Kurdish and Internationalist Youth is now [present in Palestine](https://www.nuceciwan111.xyz/en/2022/08/01/internationalist-and-kurdish-youth-delegation-in-palestine/) and shared a report on the current situation on the last days, the report can be read as it follows:

“Since the Israeli army bombed the Palestinian open-air prison in Gaza with air strikes on Aug. 5, the situation has escalated again. Under the pretext of ‘fighting terrorism,’ Israel is firing missiles at Gaza to supposedly kill PIJ jihadists exclusively. Ostensibly, they want to avoid civilian casualties, but of the more than 32 killed so far, the majority are civilians.

Operation ‘Dawn’, scheduled for the whole of next week, is a planned military action by Israeli Zionism against the people of Gaza. It already began with an operation against a leading member of the PIJ (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) and is now expanding to a collective punishment of the population of Gaza. PIJ militants, for their part, are responding to the attacks by launching rockets at various areas in Israel.

As a Kurdish and internationalist youth delegation, we are currently still in the West Bank. Near Tel Aviv and Al-Quds (Jerusalem), rockets of the PIJ have arrived on country roads. While in 5 cities Israelis and Palestinians already held protests together against the attacks on Gaza, ultra-right settlers in Al-Quds announced the storming of the Al-Aksa mosque. This escalation of the war is the strongest since May 10 last year. That Gaza has been bombed repeatedly for decades is part of the Zionist extermination plan and the total dehumanization and collective torture of the Palestinian people. It is the continuation of the Nakba that has never stopped since ’48 – the continuation of the Zionist policy of extermination.

Although the scale and explicitness of the violence in Gaza and the West Bank differ, in essence it is the same policy, the same agenda. Nevertheless, the tension is clearly felt in the West Bank as well. In the global media, a conflict is constructed between Jewish Israel and Islamist currents of Palestine. This narrative of a religious conflict between a state and extremist terrorists not only aims at further escalation, but also undercuts Palestinian solidarity and common resistance. Although the political currents and representations in each of Gaza and the West Bank differ greatly, and there is great resentment especially among the progressive population of Palestine over their political practices, there is strong cohesion and solidarity across the common stance against the Zionist attacks.

Nevertheless, solidarity within Palestine must not be rested on. Every imperialist war always has its roots in Western countries, and that is where it is necessary to attack them. Be it the war industry that supplies Turkey or the anti-Palestinian repression in Germany. ‘He who hates the Jews is the greatest friend of the Zionis’ was a comment of a Jewish comrade of the Farkha Festival. Those who hate the Jews do everything to get rid of them from their own country and to strengthen the fascism of the Zionists. Therefore, it is necessary to stand and fight internationally with our Palestinian brothers and sisters!

At the beginning of the message, the committee stated that the patriarchal system attacks communities, especially women, everywhere in the world in the form of special and physical warfare, and continues as follows:

*“Today, August 3, from the Genealogy Camp of Martyr Tolhildan Raman, we are the Yezidi people and they especially remember the women who faced one of the biggest genocides of the modern era. 8 years ago, in 2014, ISIS mercenaries entered Shengal and killed thousands of people, as well as kidnapped more than 5000 Yezidi women and sold them as slaves. After a year, the people resisted alongside the PKK guerrillas and established their own administration. Also, women played an important role in this resistance.*

*Today, some women were rescued by other Yezidi women and took responsibility for their society and people. We promise not to forget the women who are still missing. We attach importance to self-organization. The struggle of the Yezidi people and women gives strength to our resistance and struggle against feminism and fascism.*

551,"Albert Woodfox, held in solitary confinement for 43 years, dies aged 75","[SOURCE](https://www.nuceciwan111.xyz/en/2022/08/05/albert-woodfox-held-in-solitary-confinement-for-43-years-dies-aged-75/)

Albert Woodfox, who is thought to have been held in solitary confinement longer than any individual in US history, having survived 43 years in a 6ft x 9ft cell in one of America’s most brutal prisons, has died aged 75. Woodfox’s death was made public on Thursday by his long-term lawyers, George Kendall and Carine Williams, and by his brother Michael Mable. They said he had died from complications caused by Covid.

Woodfox was a member of the so-called “Angola Three” – prisoners who were wrongfully convicted of the 1972 murder of a prison guard, Brent Miller, in Louisiana state penitentiary. The prison was built on the site of a former slave plantation and was commonly known as Angola, after the country from which most of the plantation’s enslaved people had been transported.

Before the murder, Woodfox and his fellow Angola Three member Herman Wallace had set up a chapter of the Black Panther party inside the prison. They used it to protest against the segregation of prisoners and the unpaid cotton picking to which Black prisoners were subjected in chain gangs in the outlying fields.

He always insisted that his false conviction and consequent treatment were punishment for his Black radicalism. Soon after his conviction in Miller’s death, Woodfox and Wallace were both placed in solitary confinement, where they both remained almost without break for more than 40 years.

Wallace was released after a concerted legal battle in 2013, even as prison authorities continued to try to get him back inside. He died from cancer two days later. Woodfox was released in 2016 on his 69th birthday. Days after walking free, he told that he had managed to endure decades of solitary, despite frequent terrifying bouts of claustrophobia, through sheer force of willpower.

“We made a conscious decision that we would never be institutionalized. As the years went by, we made efforts to improve and motivate ourselves,” he said.

After his release, Woodfox wrote a prize-winning memoir, “Solitary: Unbroken by Four Decades in Solitary Confinement. My Story of Transformation and Hope.”

In later interviews over the years, and in his 2019 book Solitary, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer prize, he gave more detail on the extraordinary strength that allowed him and Wallace – “the other part of my heart”, as Woodfox described his friend – to withstand solitary. The conditions they endured have been known to cause mental breakdown in individuals within a week, let alone 40 years.

In the book, he wrote about his childhood and how his mother struggled to keep the family cared for, how as a teenager and a young man he was in and out of jails and prisons, and how he became radicalized when he met members of the Black Panther Party, and went on to establish the first chapter of the organization at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola to address horrific conditions at the former cotton plantation. Not long after this, he and fellow prisoner Herman Wallace were accused in 1972 of stabbing prison guard Brent Miller. The two men always maintained their innocence, saying they were targeted because of their political activity. Woodfox, Wallace and a third man, Robert King, became collectively known as the Angola 3.

**Woodfox said that he buried himself in prison books, studying Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey.** He organized games played up and down the line of solitary cells by shouting down the tier or banging on pipes – that way they held maths tests and general knowledge quizzes about Black history.

He was most proud of having in similar fashion taught several young prisoners how to read.

*“Our cells were meant to be death chambers but we turned them into schools, into debate halls,”* Woodfox told. *“We used the time to develop the tools that we needed to survive, to be part of society and humanity rather than becoming bitter and angry and consumed by a thirst for revenge.”*

**In the six years of freedom that Woodfox enjoyed he devoted himself to educating the public in the US and beyond about the atrocities of the US criminal justice system. He travelled widely domestically and around the world to address audiences of school children and judges.**

At home back in New Orleans, he found joy wherever he could. He visited the grave of his beloved mother, Ruby Mable Hamlin, who had died while he was still incarcerated, and enjoyed untrammeled time with his daughter, Brenda Poole, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and his life partner, Leslie George.

He also adopted a stray dog found wandering on a levee near Lake Pontchartrain. He named the pup Hobo.

Notwithstanding all the institutional cruelty that was rained down on him over so many years, Woodfox remained an incurable optimist to the end. In his book he writes: “I have hope for humankind. It is my hope that a new human being will evolve so that needless pain and suffering, poverty, exploitation, racism, and injustice will be things of the past.”",wgcb65,98,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/wgcb65/albert_woodfox_held_in_solitary_confinement_for/,"['thanks for sharing, what a fucking BOSS']"

The struggle of life is the consciousness of leaders

The peoples who have not yet lost their sense of freedom, i.e. have not internalized slavery, reach a stage where they will no longer recognize any obstacles after years of overcoming the breaches of will and ideas that have arisen through years of strict despotism.

In fact, society and freedom are two subjective phenomena in human life that complement each other.

Our Chairman said: *“It is a correct statement to say that the more a society has concentrated in terms of intelligence, culture and spiritual power, the more vulnerable it has made itself to liberty. Again, it is fair to say that the more a society is deprived of this intelligence, reason, and cultural values, the more slavery it experiences. In this sense, it is appropriate to define freedom as a force for social construction.”*

With his statement he justified the statement that freedom is not only the main purpose of human societies but also of the universe. While the main pillar and sine qua non of sociality is attaining liberty, to give up the death penalty or be discouraged, whether by mental or physical slavery, is tantamount to gaining freedom.

Furthermore, even definitions such as individual freedom are deceived by the deception of capitalist state systems. The freedom of the individual goes through the freedom of society. In particular, in recent years, the mentality *“I have no problems, I’m at home, I’m at work, I live my life, I’m cultivated, I eat and drink, I don’t harm anyone”* has been consciously tested and developed.

Above all, one must realize that this logic plays into the hands of governments and serves to abandon the reality of free people. The individual who does not ground himself in his society is no longer himself. Not protecting one’s own social values ​​means isolating oneself from this society. This self-isolating individual type is vulnerable, disposable, usable, isolated, subject to state exploitation, chewed between the molars of fascism and consumed.

This situation that individuals find themselves in today has been used by societies throughout history as a method of punishment. In other words, if an individual in society seriously harms that society and does not improve, he is excluded from society. Being outcast was the ultimate punishment for a person because it was tantamount to being left to die.

Today everything is turned upside down by capitalism. **The person has been deceived by the lie of individual freedom and placed in a trap that will isolate themselves.** Now individuals are pulling their own rope, which means fascism is succeeding in a short and easy way.

When individual liberty is emphasized in a place, there is state policy and that means that both individual and societal liberty are directly targeted. In other words, a person (particularly a Kurd) who says: *“I have no problem with anyone who does anything, I have no problem”,*is in a position that is fully supported by state politics and yet it is the most dangerous position. In fact, this person has no more society that could save him from the fascists, annihilation, massacres and looters of the Turkish state and condemned himself to complete defenselessness. Because she turned her back on herself and his company, cheated on herself or was made to do so.

Every individual who makes up society must firmly believe in the power of society and sociality. In the realm of humanity everything has a character that can be destroyed, comes and goes. All structures, including states, are the intellectual product of the power and material interests of a group of people. Society is the existence of humanity, it has an unshakable power, it is the essence. For this reason, the enemy first tries to disperse society and sociality, and to separate individuals from their social values. From this, everyone should be able to clearly draw the following conclusion; The only fear of any power structuring is that of organized society and sociality. State capitalist systems are like a deflated balloon. They are visible to the eye when filled with people for the purpose of air.

Her only remedy is not to leave a single person behind who could bother him from the outside. Because it is inflated and extremely sensitive. People in that bubble think the whole world is made of that stuff. But the real free world is outside of that. **The state is afraid of the phenomenon of society, society’s reflexes, because they know and believe in their power.** Then, on the contrary, it is essential to our freedom that we as peoples and the individuals who make up those peoples see, recognize and experience that power. In other words, going back to the beginning, no power can stand against an organized society. Victory will definitely be won by a freely organized society.

There are many examples of this around the world.

While the constant struggles could win victory among these examples, those who were short-term, one-sided, fragmented, without strategy, without aim, or without faith scattered.

Especially after 1945, revolutionary people’s organizations emerged in almost every country in the world. From Latin America to Asia, Africa and the Middle East, national liberation wars and revolutions have followed one another, hundreds of experiences have evolved and influenced each other. Serious armed movements emerged even in western Europe and the United States, and national resistance developed in Ireland, the Basque Country and Corsica.

* Especially to Cuba and Vietnam;
* Tupamaros in Uruguay;
* National Liberation Army in Venezuela;
* Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) in Chile;
* ELN in Bolivia;
* FSLN in Nicaragua;
* Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador;
* FARC, the Founded in Colombia in 1965 and still exists today, as well as the ELN,
* PAICG in Africa led by Amilcar Cabral in Guinea-Bissau;
* FRELİMO organization by Samora Machel in Mozambique;
* ZANU in Zimbabwe;
* MPLA led by Agustino Neto in Angola;
* NPA in Philipines;
* Naxalites in India;

Likewise, the revolutionary centers formed in Palestine formed, notably the PFLP, the People’s Fedayeen Organization in Iran, Yemen, Oman, Morocco, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia and Laos.

**While each of these examples has a different uniqueness to it, all have organized against state power and achieved victory by using guerrilla tactics against armies and states.** The resistance of the Kurdish people also has its own specifics and especially for more than forty years these specifics have been analyzed by our chairman and the front of the revolution as a whole has been opened.

Like almost all other world revolutions, this revolution was also led by the guerrillas with great success and is being implemented increasingly today. Whether urban guerrillas or people’s defense units, and urban warfare, which is one of the most important pillars for carrying out the revolution, are the basic duties of all of us as human beings. For this, on the one hand, the rural-based guerrilla warfare is developed and intensified, while at the same time it is necessary to make the motivation of the war tangible in the cities and to be a practical force, a supporter of this war of liberation. The most fundamental pillar to break the enemy are the cities, that is, it is the heart of the enemy who aims to live in prosperity within the borders of his own state by banning war from his country.

Being aware of our responsibility as Kurdish youth and people to organize ourselves in the form of cells without expecting anything from anyone is the second of the concrete duties of the people in the revolutionary people’s war. In the face of enemy attacks in Northern Kurdistan, every conscious and organized person is a natural member of the YPS. A people organizing for a common social purpose has largely won the war. Even the sense of the existence of this organization has a deterrent effect on the enemy. Today, the Rojava Revolution and the YPS War are themselves examples being explored and inspired by all the oppressed peoples of the world.

As Kurdish people and other peoples living in Kurdistan, we have had serious experiences of urban warfare. In particular, the resistance to self-government that developed in northern Kurdistan between 2015 and 2016 is a serious legacy for us. ***Starting from this heritage, by drawing the necessary conclusions, the organizational model as completely hidden cells in villages, neighborhoods and cities should be taken as the basis, which is the organizational language and form of this process.***  Every human being who has this awareness has a second or third person that they can trust. Not being able to trust anyone or trying to create an atmosphere of complete distrust is also hostile politics.

***Organizing is an act of reproduction. The cell is a professional illegal reproduction. A person who truly understands freedom and has a great passion for it can certainly organize another person.*** Our people have serious experience in this matter. They know who wants what, who can be treated how, who can be included in these secret organizational structures, and who is striving for it. For each purpose, the individual finds another individual or two nearby, organizes, and turns into a cell. The cells are independent of each other and completely hidden.

They are in the system, but the system does not know them at all. They are purely civilian, but at the same time they are the vanguard of the revolution, of the revolutionary people’s war. No one else around can tell they are cells because they have never exhibited a deficit in the way they move in their normal lives. It’s actually a military structure, but they’re careful not to lose their old civilian look. let’s think about it; The existence of just one or two or more such cells in each neighborhood will determine what role they will play in city wars.

Today the Kurds and the revolutionary democratic people are present everywhere in Turkey. This means that there is a concrete basis and condition for these cell structures not only in Kurdistan, but in all Turkish metropolises. If everyone acts at the point of forming their own cells, total structuring means forming a secret people’s war revolutionary army within the system, right next to the enemy, that is, in the areas where the enemy is most vulnerable.

In this process we must give up our search for a central organization, throwing off the legal shell and our habits. Our common goal is liberation. Ordinary latent cells derive their perspective from the already developing process. In addition, these cells, which organize themselves everywhere without knowing about each other, naturally ensure cooperation with their practices in the sense of common goals. These cell organizations, which are essentially YPS, will also organize their society with the practices that we will open later in this article, and they will become the vanguards of exposing the reality of societal resistance against Turkish fascism.

I want to emphasize again; Just as our first duty as a people in the people’s revolutionary war was to become clear in consciousness and in struggle, so another duty is to organize.",wfcrjb,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/wfcrjb/the_duties_of_the_people_under_revolutionary/,[]

558,FBI conducts coordinated raids against Black Liberation organization,"[SOURCE](https://www.nuceciwan111.xyz/en/2022/08/02/fbi-conducts-coordinated-raids-against-black-liberation-organization/)

On July 29 at 5 am, the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) conducted a violent raid on the home of Omali Yeshitela, Chairman of the US-based African People’s Socialist Party (APSP), in St. Louis, Missouri. In a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXTI0f2YNmg) posted the next day, Yeshitela claims that FBI deployed flashbang grenades, carried automatic weapons, damaged the property of his neighbors including smashing windows, and handcuffed himself and his wife. Yeshitela also claims that the FBI refused to show him a search warrant and that they took his cellphones and all other devices from his home.

It was only later that Yeshitela learned that the raid on his home was only a part of several raids across the country against locations affiliated with the APSP. That same day, the FBI raided the Uhuru Solidarity Center, also in St. Louis, and the Uhuru House in St. Petersburg, Florida, both locations of the Uhuru Movement, led by the African People’s Socialist Party. According to Yeshitela, the FBI also raided the APSP’s radio station Black Power 96.3 FM, and reportedly detained a prominent APSP leader.

The raids came as a result of a Justice Department indictment of a Russian man, Aleksandr Ionov who the US government alleges funded and supported Black organizations as part of a “foreign malign influence campaign against the US”. The indictment never specifically names any organization but refers to a “U.S. Political Group 1,” in St. Petersburg, which allegedly partnered with Ionov.

“Ain’t no Russian been responsible for what we face everyday in our lives,” Yeshitela stated. “\[The US\] is going to say that the Russians somehow had to tell us that we are being oppressed…\[the US is\] telling the world that Black people don’t have enough sense to be able to lead our own struggle, but that’s not true.”

In response to the raid, Ajamu Baraka, leader of the Black Alliance for Peace, tweeted, “As predicted, Black radicals are targeted again for not falling in line with US imperial agenda on Ukraine.” The APSP has been critical of the US involvement in the Russia–Ukraine war. Attorney and organizer Kamau Franklin stated, “This is a COINTELPRO operation. One meant to destroy Black organizations.”

COINTELPRO was an FBI program that existed from 1956 to 1971, which, in its own words, existed to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize” revolutionary organizations. The FBI and local police conducted raids on offices of organizations such as the Black Panther Party (BPP). In a particularly harsh illegal raid in Philadelphia, Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo threatened, “if they break our law, we’ll be there. The police, we’ll be there, and we’ll see who wins.”

US law enforcement also conducted raids on individuals, such as Fred Hampton, the chairman of the Chicago BPP, who was assassinated by Chicago police during one such raid. In his video, Yeshitela notes that the raid on his house was conducted one hour after Hampton’s assassination, which occured at 4 AM, December 4, 1969.

COINTELPRO is a central reason that many US political prisoners, who were former Black revolutionaries in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, are in prison today. Examples include Mutulu Shakur and Mumia Abu-Jamal.",we8p7h,60,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/we8p7h/fbi_conducts_coordinated_raids_against_black/,"['The same FBI that killed Dr. King, Malcolm, Hampton, and dozens of Panthers?

https://preview.redd.it/7d9go9nlx3f91.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=baad4a82b1b0034e70bee071392426b61ee5c477

After a break of two years caused by the Corona pandemic, the annual Farkha Youth Festival is taking place in Palestine for the 27th time. This festival brings together Palestinian youth as well as internationalists from all over the world. Within a week, not only perspectives are exchanged through political discussions and seminars, but also practical work, such as planting trees and laying roads, is done in the village. In 2022, as internationalist and Kurdish youth, we were part of the 50-member delegation of youth organizations from different countries to come to Farkha to exchange with the democratic forces of Palestine and to make the solidarity of peoples practical on the basis of the internationalist spirit.

Before the actual festival began, we started a three-day political tour of several places in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel. In each of these places, we were shown different dimensions of state repression. The different faces of the aggressive occupation policy can already be seen, especially in the West Bank, through the so-called “ABC division”. The C-area describes the areas which are completely under military and political control of the Israeli state, the B-area those which are militarily administered by Israel, but politically by the Palestinian Authority. The A-area is under Palestinian military and political control. In the following we will describe the impressions of the individual places and their historical classification.

On July 28, we were warmly welcomed in Yafa/Al-Nazareth by the youth of the Communist Party of Israel (MAKI), which consists of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied Palestine. With the 50 internationals of the delegation and the Palestinian youth, we started the evening with revolutionary songs and after the first acquaintance we were accommodated in families.

The three following days consisted of the political tour of the places: Ma’alul, Akka, Al-Quds (Jerusalem), Bethlehem and Al-Khalil (Hebron).

**Ma’alul**

Ma’alul is one of the hundreds of villages destroyed at the beginning of the Nakba (catastrophe) in 1948. The Nakba describes the establishment of the State of Israel and the resulting forced displacements, expulsions and killings of the indigenous Palestinian population. Around 750,000 Palestinians were displaced in 1948, but for society, the Nakba is not a one-time event. Due to the various state measures and the repressive and apartheid regime that was established, expulsions and direct violence continue to take place to this day.  
Before 1948, the village of Ma’alul was a multicultural village where mainly Muslims and Christians lived together. Witnesses of this coexistence can still be seen today in the form of the destroyed mosque and the preserved church. While the reconstruction of the mosque was forbidden by the state, the church is at least sporadically used again for weddings. This reappropriation of the village is part of the resistance against the state occupation policy. Groups of young people also keep coming to the destroyed village to collect garbage and to take care of the preservation of the church. These efforts are regularly harassed and destroyed by settler groups. The Christian population was offered to return to the village after the expulsion, but they refused to resume village life without their Muslim neighbors and thus become part of their displacement.

**Al-Quds**  
In Al-Quds, we spent the day mainly in the Old City, which is located in the east of the city and is surrounded by a large, historic city wall. Al-Quds is divided into two parts, the occupied east and the annexed west of the city.  
The consequences of the Nakba are also readily apparent here: in 1948, some 28,000 Palestinians were pushed from western Al-Quds to the east, thus becoming refugees in their own city. This policy continues today, in line with the motto “More Land, Less People.” In order to achieve this goal, various means are used, such as the construction of a wall in the early 2000s, which serves to separate and fragment the Palestinian population, or the constant growth of illegal settlements in East Jerusalem by the settlers and the consequent destruction of their homes.

In addition to the all too evident settlement policies that characterize the city, Al-Quds is also a center of history and culture. Places like the Al Aqsa Mosque and the massive city wall are just two of the sites that make this city an immensely important heritage site for humanity. This makes the alienation and gentrification that is taking place to turn a historic meeting place of cultures, in the midst of a vibrant city, into a tourist desert all the more despicable.

A special moment for us was a brief encounter with the Kurdish population of the city, who despite centuries of existence in Palestine have still preserved their language and culture.

**Bethlehem**

Bethlehem and Al-Quds are separated by an 8 meter high apartheid wall. As a delegation we went to the Banksy Museum, which is right next to the wall and documents the crimes of the IDF along with art. From M-16s hidden in cuddly toys, tear gas, cluster bombs and armored eviction trucks to testimonies and thus confessions of former IDF soldiers, the full extent of the occupation since 1948 became clear in the museum. The everyday harassment and attacks that escalated from ’48 to the 1st and 2nd Intifada were presented. For example, soldiers who are bored shooting at the water tanks of Palestinian homes.

**Al-Khalil**

Settler colonialism in Al-Khalil is symbolic of Israel’s apartheid policies. Al-Khalil is actually considered an A-Zone, i.e. under Palestinian self-government, but piece by piece the city center is occupied by the (Orthodox) Jewish settlers. The settlers there are the most fascist apartheid Zionists in Israel. For the purpose of alleged ‘self-defense’ they walk through the cities with M-16 machine guns, pelting the Palestinian population and especially the youth with stones, garbage, sewage, diapers and sometimes iron bars. One man was thrown an iron bar on his head some time ago, which penetrated 4cm into his skull. These fascist crimes are not punished. They terrorize the population until they are forced to leave their homes, then they break in and occupy them. If the youth of Palestine resist this terror, the IDF responds with weapons of war such as the ‘Skunk truck’, from which a chemical mixture is fired at high pressure through water cannons up to 100m. A few splashes are enough to carry the sickening smell for weeks. The rest of the canisters they dump into homes, stores or over cars. Or weapons of war like ‘the scream’, a device that emits such a loud sound that it causes physically unbearable pain. Shooting is mostly done with rubber bullets, sometimes with live ammunition. The 50 internationalists were visibly moved by the descriptions of the war practices of this gigantic fascist superior force against the indigenous population.

All these heinous practices serve Israel’s policy of complete crushing of the remaining Palestinian resistance and terrorization of society.

After getting a lot of new impressions and knowledge about Palestine and its history during these 3 days, it is time to get to know the society as well. Immediately after arriving in Farkha, we participated in the opening demonstration together with hundreds of residents of the village. Afterwards, an opening ceremony was held with speeches and music, as well as theater and dance performances by Farkha’s youth. The resulting morale and enthusiasm immediately spread to all festival participants and provided a successful transition for the days to come.

RojNews published a sound recording showing that Mehmet Zeki Çelebi, who was murdered as a result of an armed attack on May 17, was threatened by the MİT. According to the news, Zeki Çelebi was excused from imposing spying some time before he was attacked.

The phone conversation between the MIT official and Mehmet Zeki Çelebi is as follows:

“**MIT**: Prior to this, I have conveyed to you the reasons and purposes of our call to you. You would appreciate that the government wants to learn something. When Şerif Bey came to us, we conveyed our purpose to him, and he showed his good intentions. We just want you to inform us. We can sit and talk somewhere. We ask for your help in this matter.

Zeki Çelebi: I have told you before, there is no information that I can share with you about anyone other than myself. I have had great difficulties for 20 years. After all these events, the state comes and asks me to give information about innocent people so that I can save myself. These are things that are far from my personality and identity. I am a patriotic Kurd and I am for the brotherhood of peoples. I said in your last call, I am far from the situation to give you information. Honestly, I can’t do what you want from me.

**MIT**: Why do you think you’ll just save yourself? This is not just about you. *You have family and children. Think about your wife and children.*

Zeki Çelebi: How possible is it to be free as a family? Think about how meaningful it can be to save a tree when a huge forest is burning.

**MIT**: We want you to write something for us for future projects. We want you to write a report.

Zeki Çelebi: You told me before that the corruption of my file was between your lips. If justice is stuck between a person’s lips, how true is it? That’s exactly what you said, right?

**MIT**: Yes, that’s exactly what I said.

Zeki Çelebi: *If my file is between the lips of a person, there can be no law in that state.*

**MIT**: The state says that if Zeki helps us, we will vanish out his file.

670,"Gire Sor - A temple of Resistance. The story of the most recent operation in South Kurdistan told by three guerrillas. The resistance was help my 11 friends, 3 survived the use of chemical weapons and told this incredible history of resistance and will!","[SOURCE](https://www.nuceciwan107.xyz/en/2022/05/25/read-it-now-gire-sor-temple-of-resistance/)

On April 23 of 2021, the indomitable guerrillas were confronting an army which was repeating the bloody history of colonialism in the Avaşîn area. The resistance in Mamreşo, Mervanos, Aris Faris, Werxelê and Basya regions, the sounds of bullets, bombs and ululations echoing in the valleys and mountains, the words that the guerrillas whispered to the most conscientious times of history in their last moments were all crying out a truth whose recognition is still pending... Surrender would lead to betrayal, resistance to victory. The flag of the colonizers would not be planted in the lands where even Alexander the Great failed... This is the story of a freedom struggle carried out by 10 guerrillas who vowed to win a victory on one of the highest peaks of Kurdistan...

The narratives about the 80-day Girê Sor resistance may not be enough to describe even one second of those days of struggle. Nevertheless, this is a reflection of what they did, which started in the red corridors of Girê Sor and flowed to their successors and into the pages of history.

ANF compiled the 80-day Girê Sor resistance from the narratives of Mizgîn Dalaho, Armanc Simko and Têkoşîn Devrim who took part in the resistance.

**Girê Sor and military positioning there**

One side of Girê Sor looks out over Govende and the other side faces Çarçela. The part facing Govende is like a natural castle; it is high and has forbidding cliffs. The part facing Çarçela is flatter. Girê Sor consists of four little hills (gupik). Together they form the great hill called Girê Sor. The guerrillas were positioned on the first hill where the battle tunnels are located. The tunnel construction here began in 2014, starting from the lowest part and going up to the summit. This strategic battle position was a large cave (şikeft) with three floors and very long tunnels. Because their tunnels were so long, each floor was separate from the others. The distance between each of the three floors was so long that one felt a different camp on each floor. Most of the gates were also removed from the cliff and used as a shield. Air circulation was no problem as it had too many gates. The structure of the cave was mostly for air strikes and air circulation. These tunnels were completed in 7 years thanks to the sweat and blood of hundreds of guerrillas. The guerrillas who were there during the invasion attack had been in their positions for a year. Hundreds of guerrillas laughed, cried, got angry, shouted, sang folk songs, danced, suffered injuries and fell as martyrs in these tunnels… Therefore, Girê Sor was like a temple with a spiritual meaning as well as a battle ground.

**Material infrastructure preparations were insufficient**

Infrastructure was also a problem due to the hill’s remote location from the province. It was necessary to take various risks in order to deal with the infrastructure. The surrounding outposts were no different from hungry wolves looking for their victims. They did not hesitate to attack like barbarians when they saw a guerrilla movement. The guerrillas had to either take risks and complete infrastructure or act according to the seasonal conditions. The seasonal conditions were not favourable for the guerrillas to complete the infrastructure in 2021. Supplies, ammunition etc. were partially provided during the winter months, but overall, there was a need for more. There was already information that there would be a Turkish military operation against Girê Sor, so some measures were taken. The tunnels were already like fortresses; they were both long and strong. Especially after the Garê attack, new measures were taken in line with the available resources, but when the attack on Avaşîn started on April 23, infrastructure preparations for this war were not complete in Girê Sor. What was complete was the enthusiasm, assertiveness and determination of the fighters. Everyone was ready to resist enemy forces under these conditions.

**Keep your heart and brain strong**

The sound of Turkish helicopters heading towards Mamreşo on the night of April 23 marked the beginning of a new process. When the first attacks began, the guerrillas were already prepared with their weapons, positions, and most importantly, their hearts... One needed courage for this war. How would one still dare to fight in the midst of all the pain if he had no courage? Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan’s motto “keep your heart and brain strong” was in the minds of the fighters. When the invasion attack in the areas of Mamreşo and Mervanos started, all the guerrillas stepped into action. Since explosive materials were scarce, saboteurs were developing new ideas, and assassins were preparing their weapons. All weapons were placed in the positions. Everyone was doing their best to confront the Turkish attack strongly. The hustle and bustle in the tunnels for the completion of the preparations and the atmosphere inside caused great excitement. The fighters were discussing how to hit the enemy forces. Preparations were being made in the tunnels, and the fighters were also concentrating on what could be done for Mamreşo. Some were saying, ‘Let’s go out and carry out an action in Sivri or hit the street below Çarçela, we should not give the enemy forces a rest’. All the fighters had the will and desire to do something for Mamreşo. Separate guards were placed on each floor and enemy activity was constantly monitored. When there was a Turkish helicopter mobility, the fighters were trying to help those in Mamreşo and Mervanos by shooting down attack helicopters with a DShK gun of 12.5 caliber. The aim was to assist those who resisted there, trying to attract the attention of the enemy forces. It was actually the most concrete form of the years-long feelings of comradeship gathered in the memory and heart. The enemy was hitting Mamreşo and airdropping troops, but all the guerrillas on the hills around were doing their best to attract the attention of the enemy troops.

(...) 

**They were many in numbers**

The enemy could not be allowed to advance so easily. Their voices could be heard from the second hill, but it was not clear where they were and the guerrillas were actually unaware that the enemy had gone so far. Soldiers were stationed on all three slopes. They arrived by land, but their numbers were enormous. Sikorsky helicopters dropped troops on the fourth hill that night. The guerrillas repeatedly struck the enemy through the general entrance with DShK fire. As a result, they did not dare to move through there. They were extending and changing their courses because of the DShK fire.

**Mizgin started the assassinations**

Mizgîn suggested an assassination while the enemy was on the second hill. The distance was roughly 500 meters. On June 22 and 23, Mizgîn carried out two targeted actions there. The enemy opened direct fire with grenade launchers and individual firearms. Mizgîn carried out a targeted action the other day while 6-7 soldiers attempted to build a shelter. The soldiers got a little closer this time, and the distance was around 450 meters. Mizgîn donned a camouflage costume, took her weapon, went outside, and fired two shots, killing one soldier and injuring another.

**Speakers flying towards the tunnels**

Following these actions, the enemy flew a bee-sized device in the air towards the tunnels and called for surrender through that thing. They were operating that thing in the middle of the field and were calling for surrender. 

**Beginning of the first clash** 

On June 23, the enemy force arrived at the first peak and attacked that morning. On the second day, it was noticed from the upper floor that the soldiers’ voices were getting quite close. The enemy was now directly on top of the cave. Mizgîn was on guard at the summit when she heard a soldier giving commands to the others and noticed three soldiers 5 meters away. When Mizgîn raised her head, the soldiers noticed the movement and the first confrontation with the invading Turkish forces started...

Turkish soldiers opened fire straight on the entryway. Mizgîn also dropped a bomb, opened fire on the soldiers, and came back to report. On that day, Özgür, Argeş, Serhildan, and Mizgîn were present on the summit floor. The first clash that day lasted over 40 minutes. The soldiers were staying away from the gates and firing from a safe distance. That day, the guerillas fired incessantly from all three gates. When the enemy density gave it to that gate, a guerrilla would fire from another gate. The enemy was stunned, and had no idea where the bullets were coming from. When they discovered at first encounter that Girê Sor was not an easy bite, they retreated to the second hill that night. After dusk, both the enemy and the guerrillas came to a halt. There were sporadic clashes during the next few days, especially in the evening. Evenings were increasingly filled with confrontations.

**We wanted to abstain from using too much ammunition**

The majority of the guerrilla’s weapons were bombs. The war was incredibly fierce in the early days, and the sound of fighting never stopped. As a result, the atmosphere was different. Some guerrillas shot the enemy, while others pulled ammunition and discovered the enemy, and while all of this was going on, the lessons learned were passed on and new measures were implemented. There was exciting mobility inside. Everyone was encouraging one another. Every guerilla made an effort to implement their branch. The ammunition was not to be wasted, yet the fingers could not be taken off the trigger. On the first day, the enemy began hurling bombs from the top gate, and the explosives were falling down as the gates were pulled upright. For example, the air flow was very strong and went from top to bottom. Following the explosions, dust, smoke, or utilized gases immediately went down to the ground. The first day was spent in combat because the enemy had not yet weighed in on explosions and chemical gases.

(...)

**The enemy is using gas now, but we are okay**

The huge device was reading the message for Girê Sor. The date was June 24th. During the reading of the message, the enemy tossed something from above, which was responded to by a gunshot. Then they detonated what they tossed. They conducted another explosion 20 seconds later. When the enemy employed chemicals, they caused a second explosion, increasing the pressure and allowing all of the gas to enter as a result of the pressure. It was known at the time that the enemy was listening in on the huge device. The enemy was using gas, and the guerilla wanted the enemy to know that their efforts were futile. They acted quickly and proceeded to converse through the device. The passageways were filled with gas, but Botan was shouting via the device, “The enemy is now employing gas, conducting explosions, but our condition is good, we are not affected at all”. At the time, the enemy was using chemicals for the first time.

**It was sweet like sugar with an odor of burnt sugar and green color**

The earliest chemical explosives they utilized had a burnt sugar odor, tasted sweet like sugar, and were green in hue. It was discovered to be a chemical weapon. It was also known to emit pleasant smells in order to avoid being bothered by the odor of chemical weapons. Têkoşîn exclaimed, “Comrade, how wonderful is the smell of this?” when he first smelled gas, because he didn’t realize it was a chemical. Botan was warning the guerrillas, saying, “Get your head down, you’ll suffocate, it’s not a joke, you’ll be harmed if you don’t take it seriously”. They were indeed affected later on. One became numbed and exhausted as a result of whatever gas the enemy used. There was resistance in the Werxelê area at the same time, and a link was formed between them. The guerrillas in the area were also warned to be cautious. They were exchanging information regarding the measures. The upper deck was small, and the ventilation was inadequate. As a result, the gases used on that floor had an effect. The guerrillas were going downwards, but Botan was not. They essentially dragged him down from the summit.

(...)

**No one agreed to leave**

Following the closure of the summit, a general review was conducted with the participation of all of the guerrillas there. Botan stated that the situation could worsen, that there was a supply deficit, that they would not leave the hill even if the supplies ran out, that they would manage even if it was only with sweetened water, and that anyone who was not prepared for these situations should tell them in advance. Botan was already considering the exclusion of a group due to the lack of supplies. Those who wish to leave can speak up, he said. Nobody was going to give up the hill. They all took turns speaking, declaring that they would resist until the end and expressing their commitment. Everyone vowed again after reaching an agreement. Botan, after all, did not send anyone away when he observed their tenacity. Botan wanted to send Delal away because she was new, but no one wanted to leave, so she stayed there until the last day.

>“But  they don’t care about what we think. They turn a deaf ear to us,” some  people complain. That is not true. They care very much about what you  think. In fact, that is the only thing about you that holds their  attention and concern. They don’t care if you go hungry, unemployed,  sick, or homeless. But they do care when you are begin- ning to  entertain resistant democratic thoughts. They get nervous when you  discard your liberal complaints and adopt a radical analysis. They do  care that you are catching on as to what the motives and functions of  the national security state and the US global empire are all about at  home and in so many corners of the world. They get furiously concerned  when you and millions like you are rejecting the pap that is served up  by corporate media and establishment leaders.

>By  controlling our perceptions, they control our society; they control  public opinion and public discourse. And they limit the range and impact  of our political consciousness. The plutocrats know that their power  comes from their ability to control our empowering responses.

We do or our low-income loved ones do. If we  refuse to be led around on a super-patriotic, fear-ridden leash and if  we come to our own decisions and act upon them more and more as our  ranks grow, then the ruling profiteers’ power shrinks and can even  unwind and crash—as has happened with dynasties and monarchies of  previous epochs.

""It was a scene that couldn't have been more cliché. One of those autumn nights so typical for this metropolis, cold and windy, in one of the dirtiest districts of the city. I still remember the occasional rain, a fine drizzle, and the dark, shabby alley in which we walked up and down. Nervously I smoked cigarette after cigarette, as I let the monologue of the stranger drip down on me like the rain. I was ready to go, I had said goodbye to everyone who was important to me. I wanted to go to the mountains, we had discussed that, and everything seemed to be clear - until the stranger held out his hand and this one word came up: join.

I had no idea what joining was, what it really meant and where it would take me. The details were uncertain, but the essentials were clear, undeniable. I lived in a world that was necessary to be radically changed, and Kurdistan was the best place to actually do so. Here, in the beast's heart, things were not getting better, they were getting worse, and we had no realistic perspective of changing that. We were trapped in the status quo.

I already had a problem with the status quo for a long time. The status quo has always been a rotten compromiseeverywhere. An imposed compromise, a forced relationship, and I struggled to adjust, to fit in. Whether family, school or other institutions, they never had it easy with me. Always insolent, always cheeky, always wanting to have the last word - that was me. It was only much later that I realized that behind many of these early conflicts was more than just the tendency to contradict. In retrospect, even at that time it was about the fundamentalquestions of social life, especially about justice. As children we had a natural relationship to each other and tothe world, we were closer to its truth and universal values. Without the consciousness of the cruel power relations and the norms and rules they impose, without the fear of the consequences of our actions, we were honest, innocent and free. It was passing through the institutions of this system that shaped and changed us and of course also me, forever.

The dimension of these largely negative changes became clear to me only much later, in the mountains of Kurdistan The process of realizing this started a few months before I found myself in a dark back alley when I promised a stranger to dedicate my life to the revolutionary struggle. As honorable as this may sound, it was a deep internal crisis and the unvarnished view of my own reality that brought me to that decision. The emergence of this crisis is inextricably linked with the search for alternatives. The small uprisings of my childhood have turned over the years into full-grown rebellions. Out of individual signs of protest grew the search for like-minded people, discussions and shared experiences that became the first steps into politics.

***The contradiction and confusion within ourselves***

The initially moderate contradictions with the system intensified quickly, both in theory and practice. The first time in handcuffs, the first stone thrown, the first tangible consequences – all these experiences only solidified the realization that the status quo was simply not an option. At the same time the search for the right way to overcome the prevailing wanted more than just protest, more than to merely denounce the injustice. I wanted to change them, to abolish them. In this spirit, I was drawn to the metropolis, to one of the alleged centers of resistance. I quickly came in touch with the right people, took part in actions and soon organized myself. We were young, willing to take risks and shared common experiences in the streets. We radicalized ourselves in words and practice, widened our fields of work and horizons. We did the right thing and had fun doing it, we lived our lives the way we wanted to live them, but the circumstances remained the same. More than that, as time went on, the reality of the system slowly but inexorable caught up with us.

Our struggle has never been more than just a small part in our everyday life, it was a hobby. The compromises grew and with every step inside the institutions also the willingness to compromise increased. Especially the first international experiences made us realize that we had to find more serious solutions to the urgent questions of that time – we needed a line, a plan, an organization. That was the conviction of at least a few, without much experience and knowledge, but with a lot of motivation. It was precisely at this time that we got to know the Kurdish liberation movement. We were impressed, we were fascinated by the radicalism and the efficiency of thismovement. But even more than that we were looking for perspectives – we hoped to find answers to our questions, solutions to our problems. We approached accordingly, with good intentions but a superficial understanding; we tried to implement in our own practice what we allegedly had learned from the movement. It didn’t take long until our own standards caught up with us. While we focused in our political struggle, mainly on our outcome, the internal contradictions started to intensify as we got deeper into theory, organization and practice. The lack of substantiated common values and beliefs became more and more obvious, but our ability to provide the correct answers did not exist.

Not that we couldn’t find the right words or analyze the problems – *the problem was our life itself, how we lived and who we were.* The better we understood the system, the more our own involvement became clearer – wewere no longer children, no longer honest, free and innocent. Although we had written the slogans of the struggle on our flags, tattooed them on our skin and screamed them out on the streets, we had to recognize early how deep the supposed enemy lived in our heads and hearts. Our existence was deeply schizophrenic, our personalities divided – being radical in the meetings, thoughts and papers but in our daily life, in the institutions, in our feelings and our private life at best reformist, often enough apolitical and opportunistic, far too often even reactionary. Even in our supposed community of beliefs we only got into one of the many roles we had to play in our lives. The scene, the group, most of our social contacts were at best communities of purpose, our relationships with each other pragmatic, calculated and focused on our own individual benefit. Because we wereunable to show our true selves even in our closest surrounding without fear of rejection, disregard or exclusion; the only hope to escape the eternal loneliness and coldness was the search for the one, perfect person.

***The search for love***

The one person who could give us everything that society denied in us: affection, closeness, sympathy, tenderness, strength, trust, safety and appreciation, in other words: Love. It was precisely in these, our closest relationships, that revealed the ugliest parts of our personalities: Envy, jealousy, claims of domination and possession were the rule, not the exception. Just as we defacto accepted and continued our role as exploited and exploiters in relation to the state and capital, we willingly reproduced these relations again an again in our own relationships. Our affection to each other often consisted of mutual objectification and what we calledlove was usually nothing more than the ultimate promise of satisfaction of one’s own needs. We didn’t love others, we loved ourselves first and abused others as a means to an end. We gave to get. On this basis we weren’t able to live true friendship, true comradeship or even true love, quite seeds for humiliation, disappointment and mutual harming.

To find a revolutionary way of dealing with all these problems would have meant to change our personalities andourselves as a collective, our relationships and our life without compromises: to free ourselves from all the supposed constraints of the system, to resist its temptations and seductions, to no longer numb ourselves, deny ourselves, prove ourselves. The truth is, most of us weren’t ready for that.

I had to painfully realize that I became a part of this whole oppressive thing by myself, that I fed and lived it, accepted, approved and actually even enjoyed it. This realization was at first even more a vague feeling, a side effect of shame about my own mistakes, pain and disappointment in view of the absence of a revolutionary way of dealing with this reality of all of us, but also my reality. That led me into a deep crisis. A crisis of meaning, literally. In this situation it was the thoughts and analyses of Rêber APO, that turned the feelings into understanding, which cleared up doubts and ambiguities. It was the philosophy of the Kurdish liberationmovement that made me understand my own reality, held up a mirror and called me to take responsibility, but without moralizing, without condemning. It was the PKK that showed a viable alternative to the eternal circle of oppressing and being oppressed.

***Understanding the meaning of Revolution***

While we became drowned personally and politically in a lack of perspective, senselessness and complicity with the system and only strengthened the prevailing conditions through our way of life, the friends of the PKK were in a merciless struggle for survival, but despite their sacrifices they kept going forward, towards victory. The heroic resistance of these people against a hostile world and the cruellest fascism was already enough to appeal to conscience and revolutionary responsibility. But not only morally, also politically and strategically, the assessment was clear: although we desperately tried not to lose confidence and hope for a better world completely, there was no real chance of success in the metropolises, not as long as we all benefit from the imperial exploitation.

The revolutionary potential of this world is in the Global South, and there was a movement that had proven in theory and practice to be able to mobilize this potential. They had managed to show the whole world an alternative to barbarism, to give hope. PKK was and still is for me the opportunity of our time - the ray of hope on the horizon, the hope to pool the fragmented, revolutionary forces of this world and a realistic possibility to create a real chance for the realization of our dreams of a liberated society. From a revolutionary view, that necessarily means that a global perspective, internationalism, conviction and strategic necessity in the struggle against a hegemonic system, is not a matter of personal preferences, but an basic requirement for any serious endeavor for change. Those who claim to be committed to the global revolution but are practically unwilling to move out of their own comfort zone should better keep silent about overcoming nationalism and individualism.

Back then, in that dark alley, it was not a question of choice as it is now. No decision between real options. When the true nature of the system and your own involvement in it is recognized for the first time, then there can be no more excuses. There is no alternative to resistance, struggle and liberation. To accept the oppression and exploitation, and to legitimize one's own participation in it despite existing alternatives, means nothing different than a compromise and practical solidarity with the prevailing conditions. I wasn't ready for it. I wasn't ready to deny myself, to accept and integrate neither to my own status quo, nor to that of this world. I was also not ready to just stand on the safe edge and applaud, to leave the filthy job only for those who have always done it for us.On that autumn night there would have been many arguments, but especially excuses, to reject the stranger's outstretched hand.

778,How much did we protect the legacy of 68 youth?,"[Source](https://www.nuceciwan104.xyz/en/2022/05/07/how-much-did-we-protect-the-legacy-of-68-youth/)

In various periods of history, there have been periods that will not be forgotten and will live on. These periods have been engraved in the memories as a pioneer and a starting point in history. The 1968 Youth Movement resonated all over the world as a rebellion movement against reactionism and its creation systems. 1968 was born from the hopes of the youth. With the slogan ‘Another world is possible’, it became the soul of the unceasing flow of freedom and once again showed that historical and political movements bearing the stamp of youth cannot be defeated.

**1968 was a revival of thought.**

Although it is not a very systematic youth movement, it is an oppositional reaction, a rebellion movement, especially the Capitalist system. It is a stance against the system that does not respond to the society and poisons the society. It stood against capitalism in capitalist countries and against real socialism in real socialist countries. In countries with national liberation problems, it has given the people the strength to come out, which encourages them. The strengthening of the resistance in Kombodia, Vietnam, Laos and many other places took its energy from this youth movement. In the Middle East, especially Palestine, Kurdistan and Turkey, it has been the spirit and action of the most concrete exits and organization.

The 68th Generation has an important place in Feminism organizations that have an important place in the Women’s Freedom Struggle. In the years of 1960 and 1980, which is called the second wave organization of feminism, women formed their organizations against fascism as seen in many periods in history. By organizing women’s committees within the student youth sector, they showed their colors in favor of socialism in the war against capitalism. With the slogan ‘There is no personal life, everything belongs to the political struggle’, the spirit of the 68 generation manifests itself in their actions. With the awareness that capitalism represents the traditional woman, they take their place in every field of struggle. Women take their place in the guerrilla struggle led by El Salvador. In India, Maoist guerrilla units join the struggle. In Afghanistan, under the name of “Afghan Revolutionary Women’s Organization (RAWA-1977),” with its pioneers named Mina, “Our dream is a free and socialist country. They organize by saying, ‘Let the colonialists perish, let men and women live free.’ in Palestine; They continue their organization by educating the people in the national liberation struggle and taking part in the war front under the names of “Palestinian Women’s Union, Democratic Women’s Organization”. Dozens of female bouncers and pioneers such as Delal Magrabi and Wefa İdris take their places in history. 68 Women’s struggle with the Revolutionary Youth Generation; It gets stronger by spreading from Lebanon to Spain, from Egypt to Latin America.

From every angle, the 1968 Youth Movement served as a turning point for the revolutionary struggle for democracy. The revolutionary leaders of the 1968 generation in Turkey, İbrahim Kaypakkaya, Deniz Gezmiş, Mahir Çayan, Yusuf Aslan, Hüseyin İnan and dozens of valiant young socialist leaders; They organized and took a front against the practices and fascism of nation-states. The radical debates on the basis of the right of nations to self-determination, and the Kurdish Question in terms of our struggle, were expressed so clearly and effectively for the first time in this period. These revolutionary leaders have almost realized a mentality change. While the seas were pouring the 6th Fleet of the American navy into the sea on the shores of Turkey, a world system was pouring into the sea and drowning it, making it almost breathless. 68 generation; Regardless of his direct attitude and organized struggle against the state that swallowed the peoples for its power, it created a revolution in the minds and had a great impact. Against this, the nation-state system executed Deniz Gezmiş, Hüseyin İnan and Yusuf Aslan on 6 May, with the thought that this effect would be overcome with executions and massacres. But the Revolutionary Leaders, believing that their thoughts will always remain as alive as their young bodies, shouted the “fraternity of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples” and the advocacy of their “joint struggle against imperialism” on the execution bench. Their thoughts and ideas could not be killed and their struggle was taken over together with our Apoist Freedom Movement. Their struggles have become massive.

We are entering a new anniversary on May 6th. On this occasion, we need to ask ourselves the questions of ‘How do we respond to the legacy that the 68 Generation has left to us young women and youth?’. When the 68 Youth Movement said, “Another world is possible”, it said “A socialist life and future is possible”. Leader APO also shows his hopes for the youth and his belief in marching to victory when he says, “Socialist and Democratic life will be built under the leadership of youth and women.” So how much ‘socialism’ do we, as young women and youth, dream of now? How aware are we of the price paid for a socialist world, and how do we weave life with its responsibility?

The date of May 6th may relaunch a landmark mission for everyone to make these inquiries again and deeply, starting with themselves. Our Apoist struggle maintains its youth with its growing resistance every year. It is up to us young people to see our role in the struggle for socialism and the legacy of resistance left to us by keeping these questionings and youth alive. Leader Apo shows this reality when he says, “We started young, we will succeed young”. A world with socialism, with the energy of youth; achieved utopias and struggle. In its realization; The pioneering role will be possible with young women and youth who claim the 68 heritage. By meeting the anniversary of May 6 with this awareness and questioning, we can be the answer to the martyrs of the freedom struggle that has been going on for thousands of years.",ukc1e4,18,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/ukc1e4/how_much_did_we_protect_the_legacy_of_68_youth/,"[""As someone who had classmates and friends whose older siblings fell in Mexico in October '68, we will never forget.

""Indigenous people are central to any work about restoration, to address climate change or biodiversity loss, says Mariam Wallet Aboubakrine, a Tuareg Indigenous leader who spoke to Mongabay by phone during the U.N.’s Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Aboubakrine comes from a pastoralist Indigenous community near Timbuktu in Mali, one of the countries partaking in the Great Green Wall initiative.

“They are the ones who lived there for millennia and transmitted knowledge that they got from the land—from generation to generation,” Aboubakrine told Mongabay. “If we want to learn how to restore, preserve and conserve, [we] really need to learn from them.”

Yon Fernandez-de-Larrinoa, leader of U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s Indigenous Peoples Unit and founder of the organization’s Pastoralists Knowledge Hub, told Mongabay that respecting Indigenous free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) is necessary for land and biocentric restoration.

 ...

According to the report, Indigenous biocultural spaces and customary use help preserve agrobiodiversity, making food systems more resilient to climate change. As proven land stewards, they will be vital to the success of the global land restoration agenda, states the GLO2. However, this is only if their rights are recognized and they are involved in the management of protected areas, it continues.""",uk1slt,55,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/uk1slt/land_restoration_requires_immediate_action_and/,['ah well good thing modern governments tend to implement recommendations of u.n. reports. /s']

The problem with alternative platforms is that the monopolization and privatization of the online commons has happened. It’s over. We have a few big winners and anyone trying to “disrupt” the market won’t be able to. \n\nLong gone are the days when an internet company could actually be founded by a bunch of nerds in a garage. These days the coding of the actual app is the easy part, what costs is scaling it and marketing. Anyone trying to break into that market is fighting an uphill battle against some of the wealthiest companies in the world, it’s a battle that a comrade cannot win. \n\nThat said it would also be the wrong battle to fight. Not only would there be a battle for the minds of people but also the economic battle I mentioned above. Why add another dimension to the struggle? \n\nAs I started off saying, communist must go where the people are. While we’re still far from a truly revolutionary situation, it’s undeniable that many many people have been radicalized to the left during the pandemic. And that’s not just because the economic situation went to shit, that only pisses people off. The reason they went left, while locked up at home during a pandemic, seems to largely be social media. Tons of radicalizing happened thanks to content on bourgeoise platforms like Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, etc. Until we are persona non grata, and auto banned for everything, we must continue reaching people there if we can \n\nThe comrades posting that shit would have never had the reach they had if they were posting on some fringe platform. \n\nWhile it’s obviously not the same thing, I think this essay from Trotsky on the Reactionary labor unions in Britain might provide some guidance for us in todays world. \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1933/09/unions-britain.htm\n\nIn short Trotsky argued that labor unions in Britain have become reactionary as fuck and comrades get booted out (social media is a bourgeoise platform, and full of reactionaries), but that’s where the workers are and socialist should be trying to make inroads there regardless of their current state. \n\n>\tAs was said, the trade unions now play not a progressive but a reactionary role. Nevertheless they still embrace millions of workers. One must not think that the workers are blind and do not see the change in the historic role of the trade unions. But what is to be done? The revolutionary road is seriously compromised in the eyes of the left wing of the workers by the zigzags and adventures of official communism. The workers say to themselves: The trade unions are bad, but without them it might be even worse. This is the psychology of being in a blind alley. Meanwhile, the trade union bureaucracy persecutes the revolutionary workers ever more boldly, ever more impudently replacing internal democracy by the arbitrary action of a clique, in essence transforming the trade unions into some sort of concentration camp for the workers during the decline of capitalism.\nUnder these conditions, the thought easily arises: Is it not possible to bypass the trade unions? Is it not possible to replace them by some sort of fresh, uncorrupted organisation of the type of revolutionary trade unions, shop committees, soviets, and the like? The fundamental mistake of such attempts lies in that they reduce to organisational experiments the great political problem of how to free the masses from the influence of the trade union bureaucracy. It is not enough to offer the masses a new address. It is necessary to seek out the masses where they are and to lead them.', 'i’d definitely be down with making a sub mastodon!']"

An article from the monthly magazine “[Revista Lêgerîn](http://www.revistalegerin.com/)” written by Tirej Swiss:

Monika Ertl

An internationalist revolutionary  
*“And if one day I must fall, then I have fallen for a great cause.”* *–* With roots in Germany, she grew wings in Bolivia

**Family situation and early marriage**

Monika’s mother’s name was Aurelia. As is so often the case with women in history, there is no accessible knowledge about her. Her father’s name was Hans. At the age of 31, he was drafted as a war correspondent for Nazi Germany. Later he was the personal cameraman of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. Because of the general situation for him after the defeat of German fascism, he, like many other Nazis, wanted to take the opportunity and go to South America. The Ertl family, Hans, Aurelia, Monika and their two sisters finally emigrated in 1952. They settled on a small farm in Bolivia called “La Dolorida.” Monika was 16 years old at the time. While Bolivian culture was new to her, there was also a large community of wealthy Germans around her, including her father’s friend and war criminal Klaus Barbie. She was her father’s favourite daughter and accompanied him on various filming expeditions. There she learned to move in more rural areas and also to handle firearms. Monika married a Bolivian-German mining engineer. This resulted in a daily routine of taking care of the household, drinking tea, playing golf, organizing charity events, and so on. Ordered around by her sexist and racist husband, who “(…) couldn’t stop comparing her to his mother,” she was naturally not at all satisfied with this kind of lifestyle. In 1969, after 11 years of marriage, she finally made the big, radical turn in her life. She divorced her husband, cut all her ties with the upper class, and joined the Bolivian National Liberation Army (ELN), now calling herself “Imilla.”

**Revolutionary Turning**

So what kind of character does it take to make such a radical decision? What kind of experience and situation do you have to be in to make a 180-degree turn in your life? When you realize the dimensions of how profoundly society needs to be revolutionized, and therefore how profoundly you need to change yourself, you need to be able to commit yourself fully to this cause. You don’t make a revolution half-heartedly. We can learn a lot from Monika’s radicalism in decisions and actions. In addition to Imilla/Monika’s strong character, there were several factors that led her to this decision. Let’s look at it:

**The perspective as a woman.**

Monika actually reached the position to which society had raised and pushed her. She was young, observant, well educated, and “looked beautiful.” She married into a wealthy family. Her husband owned a copper mine and had some influence and economic power. It fell to her to support him in all aspects of daily life and to manage the household as best she could. An example of the strongly patriarchal environment in which she found herself is the story about the childless couple. Her husband was infertile for biological reasons. When people began to question the couple, all the blame for the lack of children was falsely placed on Monika. In this society, where a woman’s worth is strongly measured by the number of children, especially boys, she gives birth to and raises, this is not an easy burden for her to bear.

Her marriage was by no means on equal terms. So even though she arrived at that point and fulfilled that role model by doing everything that was expected of her, she obviously could not become happy. That was certainly a trigger for her to start questioning society and class so much. She realized that this simply could not be the life of freedom she dreamed of.

**Class perspective and historical background**

A big influence on her awareness of class struggle was certainly the fact that she lived with her husband very close to the copper mine he owned. She saw directly the great difference between the ordinary workers, the conditions under which they lived and, on the other hand, how she herself lived as a European lady in a well-protected, rich house. It was certainly not easy to have to realize how wrong this colonial reality was and to learn about one’s own racist thoughts and behaviors. The need to deal with politics, with the affairs of ordinary people, to understand what concerns they have, is also related to her father’s story. Monika felt guilty because of her German origin. Especially because her father actively participated in and worked for the fascist regime. She felt responsible for giving back to the world something beautiful, something revolutionary. 

**The world on the move**

Not only Imilla/Monika changed and developed during this time, but also the movements towards democratic socialism all over the world gained strength and hope. Scattered across the continents, there were more and more anti-imperialist efforts and successes in Africa, South America and Asia. Popular resistance in Vietnam was at its height, so was the revolution in the Republic of Congo, the civil rights movement in the United States was finding new strength, huge demonstrations of students and workers were springing up in the center of Europe, and even greater uprisings in the Eastern countries. It seemed as if the anti-systemic movements of the capitalist periphery and those of the metropolises united, creating a unique situation in history. Capitalist rule began to falter and hit its foundations. We can see Monika as an example of the spirit of her time.

**Monika Ertl’s Revenge**

In October 1967, Che Guevara was ambushed and killed. His hands were cut off on the orders of Roberto Quintanilla Pereira and his body was secretly buried. Along with him, many of Şehîd’s comrades fell. As in other South American countries, Bolivia’s counterinsurgency program, modeled on the SS organization in Nazi Germany, was built largely on the experience of former SS members in exile, including Klaus Barbie, who also served in the CIA on the side. Pereira was the most important counterguerrilla officer. He was known as a “guerrilla hunter” and was responsible for the torture and killing of many comrades. In 1969, our internationalist friend joined the National Liberation Army of Bolivia. The guerrillas were still in a critical phase, but despite their small numbers, severe repression and lack of support in society, they continued to build. Monika began a relationship with Inti Peredo the leader of the guerrilla and successor to Guevara, who later that year also fell into the hands of Roberto Quintanilla Pereira by the secret service of the state. After the death of her lover, she wrote a poem. We can only imagine how much she learned to hate this man who killed many friends and relatives of hers. “Quintanilla, Quintanilla…., You will find no more peace in your nights… You robbed Inti of life And you meant all the people.” Pereira took the job as Bolivian consul in Germany to avoid the danger of revenge acts against him. However, this could not protect him. Monika Imilla traveled back to her homeland with a clear mission. In 1971 she went straight to him and shot him three bullets in the chest. This action is something special in history. What kind of relationship must one have for such a direct act of revenge? How strong in character as well as ideologically must one be? She managed to escape from the scene and travel to Cuba, where she met with the French philosopher and journalist Régis Debray. Together “(…) they thought about different possible actions, how to win international solidarity. And then we had the idea to kidnap the former Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie”. They wanted to show that it was the same man who brutally suppressed the democratic resistance in the French city of Lyon during the Nazi occupation, and who was now trying to crush the Bolivian revolution in its roots by extraditing him to France. Monika returned to Bolivia where the ELN worked to get the Kadros out of the country, having planted seeds in society for their eventual return. In a small house in LaPaz, Monika worked printing and distributing leaflets. She insisted on staying there and continuing her work. On May 12, In the streets of LaPaz, Bolivia, Monika “Imilla” Ertl was ambushed by the Bolivian government, captured, tortured and later killed. With her was Ukaski, a young Argentine internationalist who shared the same fate. She was spied on by Klaus Barbie himself, who was able to recognize her in public spaces. 

**What can we learn? What is this story about? What can we learn from Monika?**

One thing, as already written, is her radicalism in decisions. Her ability to put analysis and conclusions into practice with unwavering commitment is truly inspiring to us. She was able to break through her class socialization and sacrifice everything she could. We can ask ourselves: what is our class background and how do we need to change to make similar steps? How can we overcome the socialization imposed on us? From her we can also learn not to give up in the face of severe repression or even defeat. Monika really understood how to live and die for the revolution itself.

**Our friend is an example of internationalism.**

Of course, she was fighting for a broader freedom, for global liberation from capitalism, but the place and culture in which she was active was not her own. What possibilities can be drawn from understanding different cultures at the same time? How does this influence our actions? Monika used her origins to seek revenge in Germany in a way that a Bolivian could not have done so easily. Her plan, along with Régis Debray, to bring Klaus Barbie to justice also required connections and knowledge of the conditions in France and Germany. But of course internationalism is much more than carrying out actions around the globe. It is about recognizing the revolutionary struggle around the world as our own. It is about recognizing our commonality in oppression and unity in our collective strength and common struggle.",tu2ab5,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageColonialism/comments/tu2ab5/the_avenger_of_che_guevara_monika_ertl/,[]
