Most of them, through personal circumstances such as being targets of male violence or living in patriarchal cultures will grow a hatred and resentment towards the misogynistic world they live in and the people who they think reinforce it. Unfortunately, instead of making that anger into a productive force for female liberation, they read 1 or 2 Andrea Dworkin books and call it a day. They think that reading “intercourse” and “right wing women” gives them all of the answers to patriarchal culture, female oppression and how to dismantle it, become unbelievably patronising towards anyone who engages with their views and assume they’ve got the secret of the universe.\n\nIt’s sad because yes, we must absolutely criticise how our entire culture is unbelievably violent and misogynistic, but they are simply completely incapable of surpassing their own bias and motives to look at things from a clearer lens, and will unironically support imperialistic warfares because “these countries hurt women anyways”, as if war and imperialism didn’t use women as a terror weapon in the first place - from the US marines raping women and children to Japan’s infamous comfort women. This is very obvious to anyone who’s read even a little bit beyond a superficial analysis of class and sex relations but they don’t because, once again, they’ve locked themselves in an echo chamber.

Whiteness is a thing because white supremacists needed a name for their violent subjugation of others, and so they gave it one. In this way, whiteness is a uniquely virulent and pathological form of social identity. It cannot survive its loss of supremacy; it cannot abide competition or mixture or “impurity.” Created by racial slavery and given a second wind by European imperialism, whiteness depends on the violent subordination of all others. Celebrate your Irish heritage if you must, or your Pennsylvania Dutch grandparents; that has nothing to do with the whiteness that names me, now, but which (partially) excluded my Irish and German ancestors when they came to this nation. Irish and Pennsylvania Dutch can and will survive incorporation into a multi-ethnic nation, but it is the *sine qua non* of whiteness that it cannot and will not. Inextricable from racial subordination, whiteness has no other content at all: whiteness is what’s left in the melting pot after everything else has been burned away. Without that xenophobic fire, it has no meaning, no substance, no fundamental.\n\n>This is why “white genocide” actually does have a meaning beyond “racial integration.” If you take away a white person’s ability to live as the undisputed master of the universe—to take his own experience as normal and privileged, and to presume all others to be debased copies of his own primary existence—then you take away his whiteness. \n\n---\n\nfrom [Buffalo Skulls](https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/buffalo-skulls/)', 'Thats not a Liberal.

184,The UK wants to defend rights in Ukraine but not in the UK,"I'm a mixed race (Chinese and white) transgender man who lives in England. I never thought I'd feel so bitter towards a situation involving vulnerable people, but it's so obvious that people only give a damn because Ukrainians are white; yet, they will get angry if you say this and accuse you of supporting Putin (I certainly do not). 

Everyone is going all out for Ukraine, but the rights of minorities in the UK are continually under threat and no one seems to care. I don't hate my country, but I don't see why I should be forever grateful to a country that will always question my loyalties as a mixed race man; or a country that doesn't believe transgender people have a right to exist.  

I'm also disabled, many disabled people are denied access to appropiate educational settings (I was one of these people), yet white refugees seem to be fast tracked for school places. Meanwhile, non-white refugee children aren't even seen as people, let alone children; they are detained in terrible conditions and attacked by the far right. 

I am genuinely pleased that people want to help Ukrainian refugees because no one should be forced to flee their homes, but this support is reserved only for white refugees. However, it often looks like people care more about the white refugees than British citizens who are being fucked over again and again. I hate writing this because I know this is the sort of crap the far right says; but I'm not saying resources should only go to a certain group, I'm saying that white refugees are being treated better than ethnic minorities whether they are citizens or not. 

The fact that British men are allowed to fight in Ukraine is frightening, especially if they have no military training and how there seems to be little official oversight.

To be fair, it's been extremley hard for us to take a definitive position on where we as communists are in this conflict and how we'll care a way forward through it. 

It's called the ""fog of war"" for a reason. One half of the Western left is quick to rush to the sympathy of Ukraine on account that Russia attacked it, and ergo that act alone warrants sympathy[. There's even memories from the Vietnam War of Western leftists calling Ho Chi Mihn a Tankie](https://youtu.be/4FR1WzmDc9E), not having any idea of the Third Worldist (they proudly called themselves that) context of the continuing struggle of decolonization. Minh even [makes explicit](https://youtu.be/_LvcM0RoBSs) that he chose the Third International because of it offered an anti-colonialist platform. 

We and the Third World prefer to retain ourselves as anti-NATO, because why the heck should we have any sympathy or obligation for the US state that has indebted it's citizens at home and abroad, if not adding insult to injury by literally bombing them? 

But I think there's questions still to be answered, which is why does the Western Left keep self-sabotaging and 'accidentally' standing against the oppressed world?

NATO and by extension its western Allies agreed in the 90s to prevent the involvement of former soviet states in military alliance as a prerequisite to disarmament of the eastern bloc. Since then the west has in many ways expanded its economic and political influence across Europe. A clear violation to the agreement of disarmament.

On August 1, 1939, he served as the staff officer of the 13th Division of the 11th Army of the Central China Expeditionary Army, and assisted the chief of staff of the division to formulate an implementation plan for participating in the first battle of Changsha.\n\nOn December 8, 1940, Kaburagi served as the senior staff officer of the Mongolian Army, and assisted the commander of the Mongolian Army to formulate the 1941 annual public security operation plan. On March 1, 1941, Kaburagi was promoted to Chief Infantry Officer. On October 9, 1942, he served as the school attached to the Army Non-commissioned Officers School. On August 2, 1943, he served as an instructor there.\n\nOn March 1, 1944, Kaburagi served as the staff officer of the Eleventh Army, and went to Wuhan, China to assist the army commander in the ""sweeping"" operation in central China. On July 7, 1944, Kaburagi was appointed chief of staff of the newly formed 34th Army.\n\nDuring that time, he ordered his troops to kill Chinese POWs and civilians. He and his men razed entire villages. This was in line with Imperial Japan\'s ""[Three Alls Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Alls_Policy)"". The three ""alls"" were ""kill all, burn all, loot all"". Chinese article suggest that Kaburagi and his men were responsible for killing thousands of people.\n\nKaburagi was promoted to Major General on March 1, 1945. On June 21, he was transferred back to Japan as Chief of Staff of the 55th Army of the Second General Army. On August 15, 1945, Japan announced its unconditional surrender. Kaburagi was arrested as a suspected war criminal and sent to Shanghai.\n\nKaburagi never faced any charges by the Kuomintang government. Normally, that meant he would\'ve just been detained for a while, then repatriated to Japan.\n\nHowever, between 1945 and 1947, American investigators were conducting trials in Shanghai. They were there since some U.S. POWs had been tortured and/or murdered by the Japanese in China, which they were not happy about. They were allowed to establish a small military commission to prosecute crimes against their men.\n\nSo while he wasn\'t charged with massacring thousands of Chinese POWs and civilians, Kaburagi did get charged with his complicity in the murders of three American POWs in the city of Hankou in December 1944.\n\n[Court documents on the case](https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/e40441/pdf/)\n\nAfter bombing the Japanese-occupied Hankou, three American airmen had been shot down and captured by Japanese soldiers.\n\nAfter the airmen were captured, Kaburagi had them paraded through the streets, where they were brutally beaten by soldiers and military police. They were beaten with sticks, iron bars, and rocks. They were then beaten further before being strangled. The bodies were then burned.\n\nAccording to another witness, one of the airmen was apparently still alive and was heard screaming as he burned to death.\n\nIn February 1946, Kaburagi and 17 of his subordinates were put on trial for the murders. They initially blamed Chinese civilians for the beatings. However, Chinese locals testified that these ""civilians"" were just disguised Japanese soldiers and military police.\n\nKaburagi claimed ignorance. However, officials said he was inherently culpable due to his rank, position, and his decision to order the parade in the first place.\n\nThere was an odd, but not unexpected issue encountered. The case was only about the murders of the three Americans. However, many of the locals were anxious, if not desperate, to see convictions.\n\nPerhaps they realized that if the Kuomintang government was not going to prosecute them, this was likely their only chance of seeing Kaburagi and his men get punished. That, and this was apparently one of the earliest war crimes trials to be held on the Chinese mainland.\n\nThe charges were still serious.

The US does that for a variety of military tasks, just as I’m sure the PLA does. Strategic and operational level thinking and planning is just as involved for them as it is for the US, and if recent US performance in Iraq and Afghanistan is anything to judge by (considering just how often American strategists continued to employ playbook operations that failed time and again to do anything other than kill a lot of people- armed and otherwise), the US has a far larger problem with “scripted” thinking than any of their potential near-peer adversaries.\n\nI won’t even comment on the ridiculously dumb and clearly bullshit propaganda line about sLaVe LaBoR.', ""Can someone remind me which country has legal slavery written right into it's constitution?

Russia and India are literally across the border, so land trade is possible.\n\nSince China currently has hypersonic missiles, this presents a real threat to US battlegroups, assuming they don't secretly have an efficient and reliable countermeasure.\n\nThe US is also in economic troubles, and building another supercarrier would take a massive amount of funds, enough to be dangerous to the national economy. Yes, they'll get the money somehow, but you really can only push people so far. Because in case of war, it'll start directly affecting the amount of consuming the average American can do, and consuming is one of the highest goods of the American public.\n\nAnd then there's the problem that China will be in a defensive position anyways.

I disagree with their intentions, and it is possible that the CIA did play a role, but regardless everyone deserves the right to protest.\n\nHowever, the media lied about it and created its own narrative like those few protests were the equivalent to a liberal revolution. The media lied about it, knowingly pulling unrelated pictures of previous protests from before 2020, most of which were IN FAVOR of the Cuban government, blurring them or altering the image so it appeared it was AGAINST the government. Not to mention the bots that copy-pasted the same messages and the blatant manipulation of social media to gain support for the color-revolution attempt. It was all just a big lie, and it was quickly proven with the large counter protests in support of the Cuban government that followed. Almost coincidentally, the US media accidentally forgot to report those protests. How unfortunate, it definitely couldn’t be that the media was trying to see a narrative!\n\nAlso, I’d love for someone to try and dig up a video of Cuban police abusing or violently breaking up these protests. Because they didn’t. Cuban people have the right to peacefully protest. UNLIKE the US, where you could easily find dozens of videos of the US police committing violence against BLM protestors *the exact same year*, and yet most people somehow believe Cuba is a totalitarian dictatorship where you aren’t allowed to demonstrate, unlike the US.\n\nDamn, it’s almost like there is more nuance to being against the Cuban protestors from 2020.', 'People protesting against US imperialism :\n\n Based.\n\nNeo-compradors ""protest"" so they could install a pro US dictator in service of US imperialism: \n\nnot Based.\n\nSee, not hard to understand.', 'Every lib argument I see is just “you like it when good things happen but don’t like it when bad things do, sounds pretty hypocritical”', 'I tried to swipe the pictures! \U0001fae0', 'average meme page owner', ""Strawman argument, ive never met a communist who didn't wholeheartedly support Cuba""]"

You see, Israel was founded on stolen Palestinian land and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, but they don\'t let only Jews do all the dirty work. There are two groups of Palestinians that Israel, through state violence, forced to align with it: The druze and (some of) the Beduin. It was through a classic divide-and-rules strategy in the 50s which I won\'t get into here. It resulted in a vast amount of Druze and Beduin soldiers and policemen in service, which take part in the oppression of other Palestinians. However, they aren\'t granted an equal status in Israeli society, they are still considered ""Arabs"" and therefore second class citizens (at best). A similar situation happens also with the Mizrachi Jews (i.e. Arab Jews), but they have a much higher ststaus in Israeli society (still lower than that of European Jews).\n\nYou can blame the Israeli Jewish working class as much as you want, and indeed we* have responsibility to end Zionist rule and oppression, but at the end of the day the people who gain most from the current status are the Capitalists, and the people who gain the least are Druze and Beduin.

To the point that a 13 year old was compelled to pick up a knife and stab a man!! Why was he forced into such a predicament? Why was he robbed of his innocence?

They are more interested in orderly scientific and economic development under an interventionist state, and will pursue “communization” as a process that will take as long as it takes. Imo, it’s the only proper approach. Stalin and the Soviets were capable leaders, but in hindsight the soviet parameters for what constituted socialism/communism were absurdly conservative.

It\'s a transitional state. State Capitalism like the NEP in the USSR under the oversight of a DoTP.  In short, China is moving ahead with great caution while using the greed of Western Capital to build its productive forces.\n\n""But the NEP ended"" Yes it did, when it was no longer necessary.  You don\'t have to agree with Deng\'s reforms, but at least understand why they happened. \n\nDeng Xiaoping did what was required for the PRC\'s survival. I\'ll try to make this as palatable as possible for the Ultras, and Gonzalites (it won\'t work, but I\'ll do my best). \n\nChina was in rough shape when Deng took power. For all of Mao\'s successes, some policies didn\'t work out and China was on the verge of imploding.  \n\nIn short, Deng opened China up to foreign investment while maintaining the DoTP. Deng, and his successors were aware of the factors that caused the USSR, and other Socialist projects blunders. They understood that the PRC was an island of Marxism in a sea of Liberalism that is inherently hostile towards Marxist projects. \n\nUsing this tamed Capital, the PRC was able to develop itself to the extent that it is today. Economically, China is too prominent in the world for the West to undermine without causing grievous harm to themselves in the process. Deng\'s plan paid off, as aggressive and arguably reckless as it was (I don\'t agree with everything he did). Now Xi Jinping\'s administration is ushering along the transition towards Socialism. \n\nI\'m sure that the Chinese wished they could just press the Socialism button and call it a day, but reality is often disappointing as we know.\n\nIf Deng\'s reforms didn\'t happen, we probably wouldn\'t have a PRC/CPC today. China would be a quasi-US puppet state that is at best a little more developed than India is today. And if the PRC went down, odds are good that the DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam would\'ve fallen with it. \n\nIf you want to call China revisionist, I won\'t stop you.  But I\'d rather have a revisionist Marxist power than a US puppet state. But Idk how to make that more palatable to the ""cHiNa Is CaPiTAlISt"" crowd.', 'Probably not.

A claim like “There’s cultural genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang” is simply unreal to most Westerners, close to pure gibberish.

The actual content of the utterance as it spills out is no more complex or nuanced than “China Bad,” and the elementary mistakes people make when they write out statements of “solidarity” make that much clear. This is not a complaint that these people have not studied China enough — there’s no reason to expect them to study China, and retrospectively I think to some extent it was a mistake to personally have spent so much time trying to teach them. It’s instead an acknowledgment that they are eagerly wielding the accusation like a club, that they are in reality *unconcerned* with its truth-content, because it serves a social purpose.\n>\n>What is this social purpose?

In this way, we can begin to understand the benefit that “victims” of propaganda derive from carelessly “spreading awareness.” Their efforts feed an ambient propaganda haze of controversy and scandal and wariness that suffocates any painful optimism (or jealousy) and ensuing sense of duty one might otherwise feel from a casual glance at the amazing things happening elsewhere. **People aren’t “falling” for atrocity propaganda; they’re eagerly seeking it out, like a soothing balm.**\n\nfrom https://redsails.org/masses-elites-and-rebels/"", '>Residential school system\n\nWestoids stop projecting the awful stuff we continue to do to indigenous people onto everyone else challenge [IMMEDIATELY FAILED]', 'Wow this is just like residential schools.

It was a christian belief that when you do something good you should hide it so you don't benefit from it. But what that does is create a culture where you don't feel like you can know who is being helpful, and who is being selfish and hoarding their wealth. \n\nBack before capitalism we had gift economies, which are exactly how they sound. People would gift things to other people, and then in turn they would be gifted things they need from others. The more you gave people gifts, the more popular and powerful you were. Rather than hoarding and being selfish, people were more often magnanimous. Social hierarchies were partially determined by how giving you were. You wanted people to see your acts of charity. Are you telling me that all these people were wrong, and the Christian imperialists were correct about doing charity in silence? \n\nNow, I'm not saying Mr. Beast is great, and I think charity under capitalism is terrible, it's a farce to keep the rich from having to be taxed appropriately to actually solve problems. But Mr. Beast didn't start off his channel by being a billionaire who wanted  to look philanthropic. I think the better argument is that he's a useful idiot for companies who want to look philanthropic. \n\nThe better alternative to charity is to tax to pay for solutions. No charity will give homes to all the homeless, but government programs can do that. No charity will give universal access to healthcare, but government can.

I’ve only ever heard ultras and libsoc/anarchists say that shit', 'Cuba is literally labeled a state sponsor of terrorism. \n\nDuring the height of the pandemic in Cuba, there was an immense struggle to obtain medical equipment and supplies that were constantly denied because of the restrictions by the USA (other countries cannot export foreign products with more than 10% its component made in the USA to Cuba). \n\nCuba is a third-world island island country with a small population and our economy is heavily dependent in all the tourism-related services, remittances, and the agricultural sector. \n\nThat last part is an actual mistake on our part. We should have diversified our economy and developed our productive forces to become a more industrialized and more sustainable economy.\n\nWe would have been in a better position if we weren\'t so dependent on the Socialist Camp and especially the USSR to acquire petrol (our main source of energy at the time and today too) and industrial and technological equipment. \n\nRegardless, Cuba cannot function like a normal country. Because it is denied access to its logical trading partner, Cuba has to find solutions by trading and cooperating with countries far away from its territory. \n\nBesides that, the Blockade worsens the living conditions of the average Cuban citizen. The government cannot guarantee the youth a standard of living better than that of their parents and grandparents before the Special Period.\n\nThe USA knows this and in efforts to weaken the Revolution it incentivizes the younger generations of professionals and workers to migrate to the USA by offering them unique entitlements, like social programs and guaranteed residency without a visa, that very few immigrants in the USA from other nationalities benefit from.\n\nAnd what is worse, the USA has a history of closing any visa appointments for Cubans and only allow Cubans in that enter through a legal port of entry, incentivizing irregular and dangerous journeys that function as an effective propaganda tool (think of all the yellow-journalism stories about Cubans ""fleeing communism"" by taking long and dangerous journeys from Nicaragua to the US-Mexican border).\n\nThe trips to Nicaragua are no longer allowed, *se jodieron los volcanes* as Cubans say. Now the ideal way to enter is by getting sponsored by a family member. Of course, the Cuban Adjustment Act still applies and all Cubans have to accept it to become a resident, which automatically labels them a ""political exile.""\n\nBasically, the USA is creating a brain drain of Cuban professionals, a human capital flight of people with degrees they gained for free in Cuba and which they can validate in the USA bypassing the debt Americans have to go through to obtain a degree. \n\nThis does not just apply to professionals but also ordinary workers that are incentivized to leave by the USA, thus decreasing Cuba\'s manpower and creating a demographic crisis.', ""It would be interesting to see what Cuba would be like if they were never embargoed by the United States. It's weird that we give a s*** about other countries trading goods and services, like I get not giving them access to the United States but like why do we care if our allies do business with them?

If it were not for the embargos then it'd be doing even better but the status quo would not shift that much. They have a higher life expectancy than people in the United States, they actually have a better health care system in almost every way (honestly kind of a low bar when compared to the u.s.). In fact they're so overflowing with doctors that they send out doctors for humanitarian missions more than any other country in the world."", '""it isn\'t real communism""\n\nLiberals won\'t understand what communism is and what not. Cuba is not communist at all, because it first needs to be achieved. We have a state, we have classes etc. A communist society has to be build upon a socialist one, which also has to be build in the first place. It is not something where you say:""We have now socialism"" and then it is magically there. It was always about building socialism/communism. Even when the young Soviet Union was founded, it was not a socialist country in first place. Lenin always spoke about ""building the dictatureship of the proletariat"". It was and it is never a formal act. The material conditions don\'t change over night. But that is the point where liberals fail. You tell them, that communism wasn\'t achieved yet, it has to be build, they don\'t understand it. Something is only A or B for them. For them, the Soviet Union was a communist state (Right, a communist state!) since 1917. They are not able to explain, why it was communist. Or how did it become socialist over night. They also fail to explain, why Cuba is now communist. In which time happend this transition? When was the period of socialism? The can\'t explain, because they don\'t know what socialism and communism is.', 'Didn’t Cuba come up with a for cure lung cancer, and create their own Covid vaccine?', 'Indeed', 'Cuba’s a bad one to choose for this meme lol. I’d gladly move to Cuba.', ""No, we almost always answer something along the lines of Cuba isn't perfect, but is doing extremely fucking well under the current economic sanctions."", ""Cuba is actually not going great because of two main reasons, yes, the embargo is one of them, the other one is the size of the country and due to the size lack of natural resources and space to use for farming and cattle.\n\nThe URSS didn't face the same issues, and it could actually keep a certain level of mutual aid with Cuba, but nowadays there's basically no one to fill that void, China is a gigantic joke of a country, it could have been way better, but they sold out.\n\nVietnam on the other hand is doing way better than Cuba and from a social (not economical) point of view it's doing even better than China."", 'I worked with many cubans who tell me its harder here than there']"

By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime's atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn't go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom. A scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system; an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them.  \n>  \n>If communists in the United States played an important role struggling for the rights of workers, the poor, African-Americans, women, and others, this was only their guileful way of gathering support among disfranchised groups and gaining power for themselves. How one gained power by fighting for the rights of powerless groups was never explained.
