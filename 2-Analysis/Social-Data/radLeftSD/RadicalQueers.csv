1,Georgina Beyer died today,"She was a politician who fought for prostitution laws and the gay civil union bill.

She was from small-town New Zealand; she was a MƒÅori transgender woman, an ex-sex worker, and extremely popular on both ends of the political spectrum. She went on to become the first openly out transgender woman mayor and minister of Parliament.

I thought you might all appreciate this brilliant wƒÅhine and her role in giving us queer young people in Aotearoa a future.

16,How TikTok Exposed The Healthcare System (Video Essay),,zv49m0,15,9,https://youtu.be/u27ZxKzQhpU,"['Only 10 mins in, but when they mentioned the psychiatrist mother, I was expecting them to make the point that the explosion in ADHD diagnosis in recent years may be an indication that the pathology itself could be flawed, that its symptoms can also be attributed to natural variance in how humans respond to very long periods of destimulation, unhappiness with work and social isolation, growing issues in the 21st century.\n\nNot that we should oppose the diagnosis entirely, say fuck it, and continue living with the very tangible symptoms of what we call ADHD, hell, I\'d given a rib for an easy source of amphetamines, and I think it pays to be pragmatic and keep pushing for better access to healthcare regardless, but I think we also ought to be somewhat critical of the notion that such a large percentage of Gen-Z has this conspicuous affliction that makes you bad at everything that seemingly only affected a fraction of the previous generations, that its manifestation only has a biological component, to be addressed by the individual, and not also a social one.\n\nIn other words, it may very well be that only medication can successfully manage these traits, otherwise there wouldn\'t such demand for improved care, but the root of why they are appearing in such numbers in specific societies, and why a professional diagnosis is necessary to treat them, seems under-explored -- this behaviour is associated with laziness, a mortal flaw under capitalism. There\'s a contradiction in trying to smooth out ""unproductivity"" within a heavily neglected labor force when it requires doling out a psychoactive substance to a large share of the population while maintaining arbitrary limitations on similar drugs. If they could they would prescribe us cocaine, but they can\'t. So there has to be all this dance and play over why we are terrible students, terrible at doing our jobs, and imo TikTok doesn\'t really answer that either. It (correctly) blames healthcare providers for not giving us what we want, but also extend the concept to try to make all the effects of a poor environment on our pscyhe into an individual flaw.']"

I suppose if I passed better it might be an issue, so voting definitely outs me so to speak, but I am in a metropolitan enough area that I don't really care, and if the person in the voting location did try to make an issue of it, there would likely be someone there to help me out.  If I were in a smaller more rural community I feel it might be a much bigger issue. \n\nThe biggest issue I have is that my voting precinct is in a christian church and I am deeply uncomfortable being in one. Christian churches don't have a great track record with being places that are safe for LGBTQ+ folks. With the increasing radicalization of the right wing into a christian fascist party, it feels.... well wrong for a voting precinct to be in a church. It makes me deeply uncomfortable and I really don't want to be there. In my opinion it is a form of voter intimidation and manipulation. As such I have in the past taken advantage of absentee voting to avoid going into the church."", 'I worked with a NGO that proposed and implemented a trans voting protocol in Colombia for the latest elections.

It\'s the term the vast majority of gay men here use to self-identify and can be safely used to refer to gay men in general or any specific gay man unless he specifically asked you not to.\n\nAs for the history of the word, we don\'t really know where it comes from, but it\'s been around a lot longer than the word ""gay"" has been used to mean ""homosexual"" in the English language, possibly going back to the 18th century. Interestingly, it didn\'t start out as a slur at all and used to be gender-neutral, encompassing lesbians as well. It eventually took on negative connotations when it started being used as a slur and still hasn\'t been entirely reclaimed entirely - especially among older gay men, there are still those who reject the word specifically because it has been used extensively to shame, insult and other them. \n\nNotably, in recent years, English terms like ""gay"" and ""queer"" have become increasingly popular in the German LGBTQIA+ community, but are rarely used in formal contexts. It\'s possible that ""schwul"" could eventually be phased out, but it\'s still embraced by a lot of gay men not just as an identity, but as a cultural signifier. Gay culture in Germany is quite prominent and has always been a significant part of our history, despite the Nazis\' attempts to erase that and the criminalization of homosexuality persisting long after the war - many aspects of modern international gay culture were practically invented here. Naturally, that\'s a source of pride for many queer people in this country.\n\nTL;DR: ""Schwul"" is highly context-dependent. If you don\'t use it in a derogatory manner, it won\'t be perceived as such.', ""That's incorrect, it hasn't been properly reclaimed yet. I still hear it being used as a general pejorative for *everything* (like your homework is *schwul*).\n\nPeople use it much, much less in that way than they did like 10 years ago, and it's now mostly used to neutrally describe sexual/romantic orientation (for men only), including by gay men themselves, but saying it's a positive word now is just wrong."", 'As far as I know, it\'s conceptually related to the older (19th century I think) way of referring to gay men, as ""warm"" or ""warmer Bruder"" - literally ""warm brother"" - and etymologically to ""schw√ºl"", meaning ""humid"".\n\nBut regarding how it\'s used, it\'s generally neutral, but is a bit context-dependent. Referring to oneself as schwul is perfectly fine, but calling someone else schwul is a lot dicier - among gay men, for instance, you may hear it used more casually/in a joking manner, but otherwise it can be perceived as the user attempting to insult someone, even though these days it is generally used in a neutral, descriptive manner to describe sexual (or romantic) orientation. A much more ""reclaimed"" word is ""queer"", like in English.', ""When we were kids we used to use schwul as an insult or to make something sound bad. However I haven't really heard it used since then, neither in a positive nor in a negative way, so there's that, but I do think it lost a lot of it's previously negative connotation... There's probably also a difference in location, I'd assume that the swiss use of schwul might be different to the german use..."", 'it just means gay (specifically refering to gay male sexuality). obviously it can be and is used in a derogatory manner sometimes, but in the way that gay also is, for example edgy teenage boys who call everything they don\'t like ""gay"" would use ""schwul"" in Germany. it\'s usually pretty clear from context whether it is being used as an insult or not.', ""Since it hasn't been said yet:\n\nSchwul was the go-to insult at schools in rougly 2000-2010.

Petra is by far one of the best people I have ever known.

They are empathetic, loving, and generous to a fault. They have a huge heart and donate almost all of their spare time to helping others.

If you've ever been to a protest event in Knoxville, chances are that Petra was standing in the sun right alongside you as a medic. This incredibly brave person put themselves in harm's way to protect others, even footing the cost of all those medic supplies themselves.

At my personal lowest, Petra gave me their last $5 so I could gas up my car and get to work. People like that are rare, and we should treasure and uplift them.

Petra is unemployed and looking for work - and as a disabled, queer, gender-non-conforming person in Appalachia, that is like living life on HARD++++ mode. Right now, they are temporarily living with family that does not support their ""lifestyle"" and have to battle the emotional toll that comes with having parents continuously punch down on your identity.

They need money to be able to gas up their car to get to interviews, to buy food (their parents are providing shelter, but not food), and to just get back on their feet.

30,Identifying as the f-slur?,"TW: slurs, violent trauma, sex shaming?

My best friend (and ex-partner) used the f-slur flippantly in a snapchat they sent me. I explained that I have a lot of serious trauma surrounding that word (PTSD, in fact, but I didn't disclose this). I told them a good rule of thumb for people with no trauma from that word is: don't fucking say it. My view is that slurs are for the people affected by them to reappropriate (if we choose) and no one else. They told me that, while they themselves don't have any trauma from it, it's ok for them to say it because they actually identify as a f\*\*\*\*t; their radical faerie friends told them it's ok because it's a ""sacred"" word in the queer community.

I... went off. I told them they were cosplaying something they don't understand and have no right to. Ended up calling them a privileged brat. I definitely went too far and even started mixing in our other beef (this whole incident is directly adjacent to another sore spot for me). But ultimately this was a call out, and I didn't say anything with the intent of being hurtful. They doubled down on their views, talking about the duty of queer people to be irreverent and challenge conventional thinking. And they KEPT SAYING THE SLUR. After promising not to around me anymore. Then they ended the conversation.

Now I've been blocked and their friend is messaging me, calling me abusive, accusing me of trying to sex shame and police other people's sexualities. All while vivid memories of violent trauma I've worked so hard to live with play on a loop in my mind.

I have therapy later today; I'll be ok. I am NOT looking for an AITA-style judgment or any advice on how to handle my situation directly. What I'm hoping to get out of this post is a gentle and civil discussion on any of the following topics:

* I'd love to learn more about this ""sacred"" use of the slur. Can anyone give a better explanation of what my friend was trying to say with this? Were they drawing from canonical queer theory?
* Does anyone have a right to identify as a f\*\*\*\*t, regardless of their history with the term?
* Do people with PTSD triggered by slurs have a right to gatekeep the use of those terms?
* If both of the above are yes, how can such people coexist? Does one of these rights trump the other?
* Where can I crosspost this to encourage further discussion (particularly if I want the more radical perspective)?

54,The heterosexualization of the LGBT assilimationists,"This is something that has bothered me. The LGBT civil rights movement is I think betraying their own interests. The liberal LGBT civil rights movement is so focused on saying ""hey we are just like you cishets so don't hate us"". They have focused on token things like gay marriage or workplace ""protections"". I'm not saying the right to gay marriage is a bad thing, but it has contributed to what I call the heterosexualization of LGBT people. The narratives haven't been the rejection of the family (especially the nuclear family), queer expression and identity or the formation of actual communities. There has been this silent adopting of heterosexual dynamics in queer relationships. The push for gay marriage was not extended to polyarmory and has been focused on maintaining isolation through mimicry of the nuclear family. That being the smallest unit of workers possible in a unit and isolating them from the rest of the queer community.

There has been a disruption in the mutual aid networks that we used to rely on. I still see some in the trans community. 

I keep on seeing things like the whole ""kink at pride"" thing and the sanitization of queer identity so it can be marketable. I think the whole ""kink at pride"" thing was honestly an attempt to push assilimation politics. I was dissapointed when even one of my friends expressed that they just wanted to be a regular person. The hidden thing about that is that ""regular"" person reinforces heterosexual norms as the default. 

Liberal identity politics are well meaning but they are honestly killing liberation movements. The focus is being turned away from dismantling the institutions that keep us oppressed (and even oppress non-queers) and rather focusing on how to make us compliant workers. Meanwhile despite all their efforts queer people still are discriminated against institutionally. Despite all of the efforts of these movements my friends can not get a job and even when they do they are underemployed. 

We already see upper and middle class cis gays turning against the rest of the queer community. 

I'm not sure what to do. I don't know how to confront and say, hey maybe we shouldn't be just accepting these token gestures and moving on. I don't know how to point out the development of heterosexual norms in the queer community. Overall this is hurting queer people and it isn't like all this is even truly getting us accepted.

The worst thing is that we have groups like TERFs who try to enforce this stuff. As much as they call themselves ""Radical Feminists"" they oppose queer identity and reinforce societal norms that we are trying to deconstruct. 

It just seems that queer liberation is being coopted and the development of local communities being interrupted with various divisions.",r02jgu,176,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/r02jgu/the_heterosexualization_of_the_lgbt/,"['Thanks for articulating this, it was really refreshing to read.

Do you ever link the ideas you‚Äôve written here to social reproduction theory?\n\nAlso this might sound patronizing but a lot of queers are stuck in self loathing and are willing to compromise on being humanized (liberation) if it means they will be desired. I don‚Äôt say that judgmentally. A lot of us face neglect/abandonment that renders us aching for love and acceptance. I cannot relate to being willing to compromise my humanity for that, but I can relate to wanting to be accepted.', 'You should read ""That\'s Revolting!

The essay is definitely worth a read and ties the modern idea of marriage to cishetnormativity and the liberal mind, as well as the institutions which control. http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-marriage-and-love\n\nAssimilation is a HUGE problem, especially in my younger generation, z. There is a lot of radical thought going on generally in this generation, more than any other since the 60s, but that radical mindset doesn\'t always make it to queer spaces. And unfortunately I see so many people giving their identities over to the altar of compromise for the sake of what they think will make them more comfortable or more accepted. I have seen more times now than I can count, ""do you think I chose this life? I was born this way, why would I choose a harder life?"" That internalized queerphobia has permeated so much of our communities, not just in Gen Z, and so many people honestly think it\'s a good argument. \n\nScience is still uncertain about the born vs not, but even if we are born this way, I love it!!! Yeah, it\'s hard being different and I will be marginalized and mistreated but I am finally comfortable in my own skin, I feel my queer ancestors (not blood but communal ancestors) in my identity and my passion. Their lives, their journeys, their struggles and all that they gave and did for queerness as a sacred space. The deaths of tens of thousands of queer people by aids, mainly men, and the loss those friends and families endured, while the world walked past, is enough to renounce the status quo and forge our own spaces and our own identities. Doesn\'t mean escapism or separation from society (although queer communes sound wonderful), but it does mean that we form communities which care and are there to help and love, like the queers of decades past did, when the world still didn\'t care, they took care of one another and knew that the compromise of their identity was a worse loss than the pains and sorrows that they faced together along the way.\n\nI am queer, my queerness is part of who I am, and that is not gonna change. Equal rights is just asking the status quo for permission to exist, and while that might serve as a coopted launching point, to end there instead of at liberation, does nothing but give cishetnormative society and its ideas of normalcy, more power. \n\nQueerness is scary to those who live in complacency and in privilege, especially those who live in the power structures made for them. It upsets their precious order  and their fragile demarcations of a black and white world. We have an identity, we have a history and we have a power that cannot be silenced and must not be compromised. We live between the black and whites of life, we walk in unknown and twilight spaces, loving and laughing as we do so. And when others slam us down and throw their hate as us, even in the pain and hurt our spirit cannot be beaten fully. That is worth preserving, and we must reclaim the cause of liberation for the sake of all who came before us, each other, and those who will live in our legacy and on the path we create for them.', 'Why do you call workplace protections ""token,"" and why is it bad for people to form nuclear families if that makes them happy?', 'we ARE regular people just like cishets', ""also, if these assimilated gays + lesbians couldn't adopt children and start their own bio families, there would be waaay less queer youth on the street."", ""Welll, I recc debating them.

Only Leninism can end queer and cishetallo women's oppression, all other ideologies're impotent and incapable at doing so. Which is why if one counts Stalinists and Anarchists as radicals and Stalinism and Anarchism as radical ideologies, then one must count TERFs as radicals and TERF as a radical ideology.\n\nAlso, I agree wit the last part.

57,White queers think the hood is more violent than their racist circles--from a rant I made in the comment of another post. US-centric.,"Their stereotypes about us don't come from actually interacting with us, so they think Black people are especially violent, that our spaces are high risk of violence--and that sentiment is present in white stereotypes about the hood regardless of gender dissidence. That's what frustrates me most, personally; these huites actually just maintained the racist stereotypes they got from the media/their own communities *without ever interacting with Black people*, and upon discovering they're queer just used their queer identity as an excuse to hold onto stereotypes *that they already had.* It's annoying.

I say all the time, if Maine is 95% white (as in, the grand majority of white folks in Maine do not have meaningful relationships or frequent interactions with poc), then how are there racists in Maine?

On top of that, these liberal queer huites really do not believe that racism is a problem in their circles. First of all, they believe they are well-intentioned in a way that Black people in the hood cannot be (because to them, Black people in the hood are inherently mean and violent). They believe their good intentions outweigh the racism that they inflict upon us, and they are also in DENIAL about the fact that they do racist shit. They also seem to be under the impression that I become a target for a flurry of violence when I step out of my home in the hood. For them, the choice between ""barely any racism"" and the dark scary violent hood full of inherently violent bLaCk people is an obvious one. They don't realize that 1) in the hood we DONT experience racism from our peers and 2) they do racist shit at a much greater frequency than many of us experience antagonism for our gender and sexuality in the hood.

At the end of the day, my CHOSEN space is going to be one full of people who allow me to thrive, hood or not. White people think their lil liberal arts twitter academies full of ""tenderqueers"" (ie people who don't read up on anti-racism, whose favorite form of communication is passive aggression, and whose idea of communal care is dogpiling--all of that is somehow the behavior of a tender person) are the pinnacle of a thriving space for all queers. These muggles say they're anti-racist but really they just feel guilty for the stuff they did to us in grade school and wanna make up for it now by complimenting us on our hair.

It's one thing for parenting to be teaching your kids useful life skills and making sure they stay safe and fed, but kids are still their own people and so many parents use children as an outlet to vicariously live through the life they wanted instead of letting the kid decide, or abuse this tiny shred of power to make themselves feel better.

I chose to represent a humboldt penguin because this animal is known for its bisexual behaviour.\n\nThe image is rather complex and can be divided into two distinct parts: a stage and a large set.\n\n1 The scene\nThe scene is presented in the centre of the image in a vertical rectangle frame with a semi-circular top. \n\nInside, a Humboldt penguin on a penny farthing can be seen in the foreground. The bird is seen from three quarters and is represented in the classic way: it has a white belly with a large black circle running from its neck to the bottom of its body,en arri√®re-plan. its back and wings are black, its head is black except for a white band (which starts behind its eyes) and a pink area at the base of its beak. The bird is sitting on the saddle of an old velocipede with a large, high front wheel (which carries the propulsion mechanism) and a small rear wheel. The handlebars are replaced by a sort of hybrid mechanism of arm levers that operate chains and move the front wheel. The frame of the bike is black and undulating. Two small flags (in pink-purple-blue bi pride colours) can be seen flying near the rear wheel. The colours of the bi prides (as mentioned before) are also present on the inside of the wheels of the velocipede (in the form of triangles whose points are in the centre of the wheels).\n\nThe penguin cyclist is shown in a seaside setting. A dirt (or sand) path can be discerned winding along a sea overhang (coming from the left). This path begins in the foreground of the scene (occupying its entire width), and ends at a small point in the middle of the background (hidden by hills). The edges of the path are filled with grass and small pink and fuchsia flowers represented by coloured touches. Several flags can also be seen planted on this border, which connects the path with the cliffs overlooking the sea. These flags represent various LGBTQIA prides, including non-binary (yellow-white-purple, black), asexual (black-grey-white-purple) and trans (blue-pink-white-pink-blue).\nIn addition to these elements, the base (green-black) and the bottom of the tower (green-grey) of a lighthouse can be seen in the right background. A group of penguins can also be seen along a cliff (on the grassy edge) watching the waves and eddies.\n\nThe frame with the scene is centred in the poster and occupies a large part of the image (about 3/4 horizontal and 2/3 vertical).\n\n2\n\nThe background of the poster is built around the scene frame. The background is brick red but is covered in many places by frames and decorations. All these elements are built symmetrically to the central vertical axis of the image, only the colours vary.\n\nAt the top, there is a large curved text strip (which follows the shape of the scene with the penguin). Its ends are in the form of semi-circles. It is filled in with an ecru background and has a thin grey border. The text inside follows the curve shown above. It reads:\n\n""THE BIG-BI"", written in a classic serif font with black outlines and the inside of the letters filled with a pale green (bottom) to white (top) gradient. A drop shadow (pale grey-red) is slightly offset to the right.\n\nTo the left of this text band (in the upper corner and in the space left free by the descending curve), a floral decoration in a style close to art nouveau can be seen. A three-petalled flower is surrounded by long, simplified leaves that fill the empty spaces. The border is blue-grey, the background is yellow and the leaves are green-yellow while the flower is grey-blue. In the symmetrical counterpart of this decoration (upper right corner) the flower is red.\n\nIn the middle of the image on the left (at the level of the scene frame) one can see a rather high vertical frame filled with a stylised representation (with similar features to the floral decoration mentioned just above) of a vase in which a flag is placed. The vase has a blue-grey base and a yellow top, while the flag\'s canopy is black. In the symmetrical counterpart (right side), the flag is red.\n\nIn the lower part of the image there is a text area in the form of an arched grey band, curved downwards. This band starts below the scene frame and occupies almost the same width. Its ends imitate rounded pieces of paper and it has a yellow upper border and a grey-blue lower border. The following text can be read on the inside:\n\n""Bi-cycle Club"", written in white in a bold font with angular serifs that imitate arrowheads. A slight black drop shadow is visible, very slightly offset towards the bottom.\n\nAbove this text band, in the space left empty by the hollow of the curve, we can see a floral decoration.\n\nAbove this text band, in the space left empty by the hollow of the curve, we can see a floral decoration in the same style as before. It represents a green thistle with a pink floral duster surrounded by yellow interlacing.\n\nBelow this text band, in the lower left corner, we can see a yellow frame with a black text:\n""Roule avec\nfiert√© et\nradicalit√©"" \nwritten in a western style font following a wave shape.\n\nThe translation of this text is readable in the symmetrical counterpart of the frame (on the right) which is grey-blue:\n""rides\nwith pride\nand fury""', ""I didn't have the patience to read all the text sorry.\n\n\nHow can I buy this?"", 'le most perfect poster ever']"

(As I\'m sure most people in this sub have some empathy for), growing up as the non-gendered kid is not going to be an easy time in middle school. Also keep in mind that your parental guidance ends the moment they leave the home. Children socialize amongst themselves and with a parade of adults who, by consequence of being chosen to interact with children, are at least somewhat normative. You cannot shield a child from gender based hegemony forever. Ultimately, such a child might reach adulthood and boomerang against the rhetoric that they feel deprived them of a childhood.\n\n\nI\'ve met several adults who grew up in a highly nontraditional family unit and now exhibit oppositional behaviors against their upbringing.

I think many of those workers would be happier if their employers gave them more free time on some days in pride month, like they do on other holidays, so they could - not in work uniform - celebrate pride month without having to be an advertisement for their company while doing it.\n\nBut the reason the companies don't do the latter is because it doesn't benefit them, so accordingly, if we criticize the way companies doing it right now it looks as if we are taking something away from the queer workers. In reality it's the capitalist seeing pride month and their queer workers as an opportunity to advertise rather than genuinely celebrating something."", 'the 1.2 upvotes... lmfaooooo']"

Yeah, if it's the first week or something, okay, that happens. BUT:

My parents' been doing this shit  for two years now and their ""I'm trying my best"" is a meaningless excuse at best and pure gaslighting at worst. There's no real support in that phrase.

I do wish the poster chose a different piece on the history of the nuclear family, though. David Brooks is a conservative columnist.

He praises early 19th century ""corporate families"", relegates the role of slavery in those families to a single parenthetical, and later spends a lot of time handwringing over unmarried black mothers in a way that echoes the ""welfare queen"" trope. None of that, needless to say, actually challenges ""amatonormativity"". There are so many histories of  and arguments against the nuclear family from the left that would work much better here, or would at least be less racist.\n\nEdit: I get how someone unfamiliar with the context of the rest of David Brooks\'s work could miss some of the harmful implications in that piece, and would just be excited to see an article critical of the nuclear family in a major publication.

Like the holidays are for straight families only. And I‚Äôd blame just Hollywood but there aren‚Äôt really any independent queer films that have been made either. The best we get are the side characters that are tokenized or there to serve as a plot point, challenge or some other kind of thing for the main straight characters.', ""Great list!

And Happiest Season had some funny moments and its exploration of being closeted was intelligent if perhaps overly sympathetic to Mackenzie Davis' character.  But as someone who hopes Christmas holiday family traditions die a slow death, I don't really care about making sure we have more holiday films for everyone.  Christmas and holiday films promote shitty traditionalist conservative values.  Slapping some rainbow paint on them doesn't change that.  I also don't begrudge anyone who wants to be included in the traditions, because being a part of traditions makes you more acceptable to other more conservative people and therefore can make you safer, and we all need safety.

There are 5 US states with less than 1 million people that can easily be turned into gay majority states in which gay people can have primacy over politics, culture and commerce. Wyoming with less than 600,000 people seems like the best option. Other alternatives are Montana, Rhode Island, and Delaware. 

A gay state would be a place where gays all over the world would visit and feel comfortable. Gays are being persecuted in a majority of countries worldwide including developed nations so a gay state is of great importance.

179,gender in my ideal world,"cn: dysphoria, genitalia as related to gender (or not), brief mention of mental illness related to gender identity & violence against gender divergent ppl towards the end

note: i say this all as a transmasc they/them person w/ lots of chest dysphoria & no genital dysphoria
-
i have a real issue w/ the trans ‚Äúborn in the wrong body‚Äù narrative. i‚Äôve got a problem with this idea of ‚Äúgirl/boy w/ the wrong parts‚Äù narrative. let me explain.

i‚Äôve never been a gender abolitionist. i am very gendered & feel extremely erased by the idea that gender isn‚Äôt real.

i believe we must destroy our cultural constructs of gender & re/build new ones based on our lived experience b/c how we relate to gender is, i believe, inherently important to humans.
-
i don‚Äôt believe genitals & secondary sex characteristics are inherently related to gender.

there‚Äôs a spectrum of biological sex, it has a variety of medical implications & implications for attraction that may or may not be connected to our genders.

(they probably are b/c of our socialization - but there‚Äôs nothing innately requiring them to be.)
-
in my brain, gender and sex simply aren‚Äôt linked. i don‚Äôt believe ppl are born with a gender.

ideally, we grow into it, discover it, build it, throughout our lifetime.
-
note: i am 110% not saying a person w/ genital dysphoria shouldn‚Äôt or doesn‚Äôt experience what they experience, it‚Äôs entirely valid, it‚Äôs a kind of suffering that can scarcely be compared & creates self-hate, isolation, loneliness, so much trauma. 

you are not alone, and this is not a judgement of what you go thru. i see these ideas as a social path towards liberation.
-
i am a muscogee (creek) nation citizen living near our tribal territory in oklahoma & i have spent a long time thinking about what identifying as ‚Äútwo-spirit‚Äù means.

i used to identify that way, but i‚Äôve stopped using that language b/c i‚Äôve start thinking about gender as:

part of our role within our communities, part of what defines our responsibilities to the ppl we‚Äôre committed to.
-
i was not given, did not inherit, and don‚Äôt follow any nation‚Äôs gender traditions. i‚Äôm not what i would consider ‚Äútwo-spirit.‚Äù

i am a self-identified indigenous person w/ ancestors of many peoples & places + a person committed to centralizing indigenous thought, values, goals, & solutions in the way i conduct my life. this is included in my gender.
-
& even though learning about indigenous gender traditions led me into my ideas, i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre exclusive to them. their traditions are, they ways gender functions in their communities & how it‚Äôs viewed are

but i believe the concepts i‚Äôve started working w/ are something our society has to learn from indigenous communities.
-
often, gender traditions in indigenous communities have social implications that don‚Äôt translate well into a colonized world.

they‚Äôre sacred, they‚Äôre often medicine ppl, seen for their gifts as children and taught how to cultivate them, or it varies in some other way based on how they feel comfortable serving or called to serve their ppl.
-
gender as commitment to community & responsibility to something larger than myself makes my gender so much. i have chest dysphoria, but it doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do w/ my gender, except insofar as other ppl make it.

ppl make assumptions about my role w/in the context of the whole based on the fact i have roughly a 38DD chest size + an hourglass figure & that‚Äôs absurd.
-
to me, my gender, the aspects of me that i consider gender, my temperament, my strengths & gifts, my preferences, the dynamics i build w/ the ppl around me, even my presentation, how i physically move & how i communicate based on my dress etc.

those all have to do with being committed to honoring the wisdom of all living things & places, human & non-human, seen & unseen - a bridge between worlds, facilitating communication, learning the ancient wisdom of rocks & trees then teaching it to my friends, clarifying, increasing understanding, cultivating compassion, re/remembering & re/writing ancient knowledge to bring it into the present for everyone to use.

they are the parts of me that celebrate the fact that pretty much everything in human experience occurs along a spectrum & we are all connected.
-
in my mind, there are no boys born with the wrong genitals. you don‚Äôt need any set of genitals to be a ‚Äúman.‚Äù humans have bodies with genitalia. you‚Äôre a man if you tell me you are the end.

girlfriends can have penises. there‚Äôs nothing else they‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù have. some girlfriends have penises.

dads can have a uterus. genitals don‚Äôt make a father.

brothers and sisters can be intersex.
i don‚Äôt even want to know about my sister‚Äôs genitals, actually, but i do want to know about her identity, her dreams & goals, & her calling in the world.
-
gender as it relates to the religious cultural genocide at the foundation of this country & as an arm of patriarchal control certainly isn‚Äôt real.

this includes our understanding of the connection b/t gender and genitals.
-
no one is born in the wrong body. you may still experience genital dysphoria! but if we stop conflating the two, maybe that dysphoria wouldn‚Äôt carry so much social stigma & shame.

if ppl could just easily access treatment w/o also being subject to social abuse, maybe what we know as gender divergent ppl wouldn‚Äôt suffer so much suicidal & self-harm ideation & be at such a high risk for violence & murder.
-
no one is born w/ the wrong parts. you were just born w/ a body & it doesn‚Äôt need to be any one specific thing at all for you to be anything & everything you are.

you may need to change your body to feel comfortable or sane, but you don‚Äôt have to change your body to be valid & anyone who tells you otherwise - church school parents internet other queers etc. - is buying into falsehoods.
-
in my ideal world, there is no cis & there is no trans b/c genitalia & gender are unrelated, it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to have a gender that‚Äôs consistent with sex assigned at birth. ideally, there‚Äôs no sex assigned at birth, we develop new language around biological sex - then there‚Äôs definitely no arbitrary gender attached to genitals. there is no non-binary because while there is masculine & feminine, there‚Äôs also any combination thereof or neither. there are as many as many genders as there are ppl.

in my idea world, there is only who you are, where you fit in, what gifts you have to contribute, the language you use to describe yourself, & the many other ways you authentically communicate what‚Äôs inside you to the ppl around you.",jwuydl,53,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/jwuydl/gender_in_my_ideal_world/,"['I highly enjoyed reading this.

180,Philosophical Discussions,"Hey all! So I am a mod on a Discord server full of LGBTQ+ people and allies and we constantly have debates, not on our server, with people who are, let's say, not friendly to the community. Of course, in a debate, one of the greatest strengths and proofs of legitimacy is to have scholarly journals and articles proving that your side is right. Simple enough, thought me copying and pasting various medical articles related to how Trans-people specifically are valid in the eyes of medicine, that'll be no problem!

There were problems.

Many problems.

I was quickly informed that while the intentions behind what I had done were good, the end result was not so much. I was told that by submitting so many medically-based articles related to Trans-people, I had unwittingly fallen into a trap of pathologizing being Trans, along with being any part of the LGBTQ+ community and medicalizing the LGBTQ+ experience. Now, when I heard this, I quickly realized my mistake and started to make amends and additions. However, I ran into another problem.

Unlike medical journals and scholarly articles, I could not search for more philosophical and humanistic journals and articles on Google Scholar, which had been my main source of articles and journals.

So I am currently in the process of contacting anyone, especially people on Trans and LGBTQ+ subreddits, for any sort of philosophical and humanistic writings on the LGBTQ+ experience and being valid not through medicine and science, but through your own experiences. I encourage anyone to submit names of people, links to articles and journals, and if there is a list of materials y'all believe would suit my needs, I will be grateful a thousand times over.

Thank you so much and I hope to get some great resources!",jwa3up,17,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/jwa3up/philosophical_discussions/,"[""This doesn't answer your question, sorry, but I'm thinking, if this is an LGBT friendly server then why do you allow debates that question LGBT peoples validity in the first place?

193,"To victims of Conversion Therapy, I need your help","My state recently failed to pass a ban on conversion therapy. While those in support of the ban are regrouping and preparing to try again, several state house *Republicans* are performing a ""study"" to see if the benefits outweigh the risks. These same House Republicans are attempting to create legislation that would actually make conversion therapy MORE accessible to parents and guardians. It is the most blatantly biased thing I've ever seen.

The study consists of interviewing an unspecified number of people. An unspecified percentage of the interviewees will be therapists and psychiatrists who practice conversion therapy. Allowing practitioners to partake in this is extremely biased and unethical. 

Here is what I need from anyone who is willing: I just want your story and experience with Conversion Therapy. Be as brutally honest as possible about the harmful effects the practice has. People need to know how not ok it is. 

Anybody who is willing to help me with this, you can message your story to me here on reddit or email it to ban.ct.petition@gmail.com or if there is another method you are more comfortable with, I'll see if I can make it happen. Everyone will remain anonymous.


I need as many eyes to see this as possible. I need as many responses as possible. I want these fuckers to feel the hurt and pain that they are causing. Who knows, if I can get enough support from within my state and from elsewhere, maybe I can convince my ""baby trump"" governor to ban it with an executive order.

\- active community groups (with spaces, gatherings, events) in small towns and rural areas

\- communes (off-grid or not)

\- campgrounds, resorts, cottage communities

The campgrounds and resorts are pretty easy to find, but I'm trying to dig deeper and find the smaller, tight-knit communities that may be flying under the radar (I've got Amber Fox - anything else?).

216,abolish monogamy (?),"i originally posted this somewhere else but i thought i'd put it here too and see what people think.

----

so i posted that [Sophie Lewis article about sexuality under capitalism](https://maljournal.com/5/sex-negative/sophie-lewis/collective-turn-off/) on Reddit the other day and there was [a short discussion in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/iab6dg/collective_turnoff_sophie_lewis_the_truth_is_that/) that got me thinking; basically someone felt very attacked because they were monogamous and didn't want to be forced into all this queery stuff.

many years ago, when i first heard people talking about ""abolishing whiteness"", it didn't make any sense to me. people can't help being born with white skin, i thought, so how does it make sense to abolish that. reading this person talking about their ""immutable monogamy"", how they were born, how they just are, reminded me of myself back then.

i'm not interested in trying to draw parallels between two different forms of oppression, but it made me wonder if simply opposing things like gay marriage and queers in the army is framing our position too much in liberalism and being afraid to talk more plainly about what we want.

i'm not monogamous, but when i talk about it, i'm always very careful to say something like, ""people should be able to choose the sort of relationships they want, including monogamy"", because i'm worried about invalidating people (who may be queer themselves) who identify with monogamy.

but now i think maybe i've been doing this all wrong. monogamy is an entrenched power structure, a privileged position, another thread in the twisted rope of hierarchy. instead of catering to monogamists, we should be talking about abolishing monogamy... right?

maybe i'm late to the party and everyone else already realised this ages ago, so i'd appreciate pointers to any other writing about this. (i'm familiar with relationship anarchy, but i've only ever seen it presented as one particular alternative to monogamy.)",iemznb,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/iemznb/abolish_monogamy/,[]

232,"Why I prefer the term ""Queer"" to LGBT","I Posted this originally on [communism.lemmy.ml](https://communism.lemmy.ml) but I thought I should share here as well. 

No one has posted in this community yet? I suppose I‚Äôll have the honor of being the first, *naturally.*

Queer. It is still a somewhat controversial term, being as many have felt the sting of it as a slur. Nonetheless many including myself have chosen to expropriate this world as an identity and umbrella term. Anyone who isn‚Äôt heterosexual, allosexual (as opposed to asexual) and cisgender is queer. I often just use the label queer as it doesn‚Äôt box me in and I don‚Äôt have to explain that I am a pansexual, graysexual, graygender person or explain what those mean to people.

Yet, LGBT and its variations are still far more popular. Perhaps CisHet people are afraid of offending, but if you are a member of the Queer Community you will no there is next to no controversy surrounding the term. It certainly isn‚Äôt like New Afrikan people using the N word, you do not need to be part of the community to say ‚Äúqueer‚Äù. I certainly won‚Äôt get mad at you anyway. ‚ÄúFa\*\*ot‚Äù and ‚ÄúDyke‚Äù are being reclaimed, but don‚Äôt toss those words around unless you are one. I think it is empowering to take what was a pejorative and own it, taking a word used to be used to hurt people and disarming it. Besides, my generation hardly ever knew queer as an insult, but we sure heard gay be used a synonym for bad constantly, so if we are gonna avoid words because of their former derogative usage that‚Äôs bad news for all my gay friends.

I know it is not the intention, but I see LGBT as a somewhat exclusionary term, and adding more letters can only help so much. LGBTTQQIAAP (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, ally, pansexual) Is the longest version I‚Äôve seen, certainly not in an organic context, that mouthful will never see popular use. Some add a plus sign as a quick fix to represent any identities not covered by the acronym, but I still think queer is less exclusionary. Someone won‚Äôt feel like *why aren‚Äôt I good enough to have a letter in the acronym, I don‚Äôt want a crumby plus sign*.

Plus queer just rolls off the tongue better.

Obviously I can‚Äôt strongarm the world into adopting Queer over LGBT, but I think they should. Especially us radicals, since it has had even stronger usage in queer radical communities.

Any thoughts, comrades?",hyhj7e,117,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/hyhj7e/why_i_prefer_the_term_queer_to_lgbt/,"['I generally assume queer has a political connotation (""not gay as in happy, queer as in fuck you""). It\'s also likely to never catch on with some people - particularly older folk, so it may be divisive. I do use it, but I don\'t really want it to _replace_ LGBT+. GSRM kinda works, but that also has issues since, literally interpreted, it includes pedophiles. I\'ve heard arguments that everyone is plus, but that seems like too big of a break from current trends.', '[deleted]', ""I'm open to both, but GRSM sounds too much like DSM to me."", 'One of the reasons I use queer is because if I say I‚Äôm queer, people will vaguely assume I‚Äôm a lesbian instead of accurately guess that I‚Äôm trans masc.

If they ask me to avoid using it around them, I will, because it\'s pushing a trauma button for them.\n\nAnyone else though? Sorry not sorry. I am queer. I live in a world that is constantly attempting to disconnect me from my identity, and make me ashamed of it. Boldly calling myself ""queer"" is a rejection of those attempts. It says ""I\'m here, I\'m not going away, and you can die mad about it"". Telling me I shouldn\'t call myself queer is too reminiscent of the attitudes that kept me in the closet until adulthood for comfort (though the intention behind them is very different).\n\nI think ""LGBT+"" is one of the better options. It keeps the core acronym that people are familiar with while acknowledging it will never be complete as we learn more about ourselves. It also forces the annoying ""LOL aLpHaBeT SaLaD"" straights to come up with a legitimate argument.', ""I came out initially as Queer many many years ago. Calling myself a Queer because gay/homo/fag/fairy all triggered my ptsd from my childhood (different from my military service connected ptsd). The activists I gravitated to called themselves Queer and did wonderful things -- radical things -- and I wanted to be associated with them.\n\nThen I got fussed at a bunch as the whole LGBT thing started. I never developed a taste for the alphabet soup. And I do not identify with most Gay men. But I went along with the Gay label thing just for convenience. \n\nRecently I have reaffirmed my Radical Queer roots of activism and liberation for the whole spectrum of oppressed people. Sexuality and Gender is kinda beside the point when a teenage junkie rent boy is dying under a freeway overpass.\n\nI am very disillusioned with the heteronormative assimilationists that run most LGBTQA+ organizations. And don't get me started on the wealthy white consumerists. I ain't got a whole lot of pink dollars to spend at Macy's just because they sponsor a float in a parade. \n\nI remember a few years ago, I was speaking to a group of college students, telling them about growing up homosexual (I really loathe that word). I made the mistake of saying I was glad the Q finally made it into the string of letters that I could never remember, and that as an old queer I finally felt like we queers had a letter of our own. I was reprimanded and told that the Q stood for questioning. That was the last LGBTQA+ event I attended.\n\nQueer is a Liberation Movement, a way of thinking about society and people that is uncommon and not normal. It's a calling from the cosmos to be different, to think differently, to love differently, to accept the queer in anybody that expresses it, and work tirelessly to free every man, woman, and child from the explotative trap of the patriarchy. \n\nBe Queer! Be Radical! Be Queer some more..."", ""I don't know it feels to some extent still derogatory for me in my experience.

It\'s no coincidence that many of the people saying ""queer is a slur"" want to be able to know what sort of queer identity someone has so they can be exclusionary to anyone they don\'t think belongs. The idea that ""queer"" isn\'t an acceptable term isn\'t just straight revisionist, it\'s a massive red flag.', 'I‚Äôm not queer. I‚Äôm a lesbian.', 'I like queer and, in particular, queerdo, but I feel that it loses flexibility as a term when you apply it as a general umbrella because there are degrees of queer. I know some cis gay men who don\'t really have a queer bone in their body. Queer culture has a distinctly non confirmative cerebral quality that I don\'t always see in the broader LGBT community (and no shade to them, dogmatically enforcing nonconformity is hypocritical).\n\n\nIt\'s such a pipe dream given how uncommon the phrase is these days, but there was a push shortly after ""gay"" started splintering to move to GSM - gender and sexual minorities. It fell out of fashion by the time LGB started standardizing, iirc. Anyway, I like how GSM acknowledges the deep ties between gender performance and sexuality, as well as the common thread of minority struggle. It has a lot of room for diversity and doesn\'t pigeonhole people who identify with it to linguistically define their experience or culture. If only we could use GSM!\n\n\nEdit: and a note on the cultural mores of queerness - I\'ve known some incredibly queer, straight, cisgendered people.

They do this because they see a trans person marrying a cis person of the other gender as a same-sex marriage, and when you try to marry they will use your birth certificate to check that your birth sexes are different rather than your passport.\n\nTheoretically it should only prevent straight trans people from marrying other cis people specifically, because (who would have guessed?) these lawmakers have no idea who they're affecting and forgot gay/lesbian/bi trans people exist and that straight trans people can marry other straight trans people. But obviously this is still an unjustified infringement on our rights and it will further stigmatize trans people. It might also be just the beginning of more transphobic laws, and it will also out any trans person whenever they have to show their birth certificate.\n\nEither way it's really bad, I just wanted to point out it doesn't ban changing your legal gender completely and it also spectacularly fails to address all trans people.""]"

I managed to find a youth shelter but the people who run it aren‚Äôt even sure how long they can keep it open, and Covid is adding more instability into everything. I‚Äôve never been more scared in my life but I also feel grateful to the people who have helped me out, especially to the person who sent me a sleeping bag and soup, you are a blessing and helped me get through many chilly nights. I had to choose between my seizure meds and chronic pain medication, which is one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever had to do. I prioritized my seizure meds so now I mostly just lay in bed in pain. While I‚Äôm lucky to have a bed at all, I can‚Äôt go on like this. I know things aren‚Äôt going great in the world in general, but if you have a little bit to spare I would be forever in your debt.

279,Covid-19 Is Straining the Concept of the Family. Let‚Äôs Break It.,,gwplca,60,2,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/family-covid-care-marriage/,"['If 50 percent of families are sites of some combination of domestic violence, sexual abuse of children, queerphobia, racism, or misogyny, we need to consider if the patriarchal family system as it exists is worth trying to repair.  Perhaps it should be replaced with a new social system for mutual care and support of all.  \n\nIt has become very trendy to say ""it takes a village"" because every parent wants lots of help with child-raising -- as long as the parents get to stay in control of ""their own"" kids.  And the conservative nostalgia for extended families is misplaced -- those historical systems just tripled the inter-generational abusive power and damage of modern nuclear families.   \n\nRather, de-normalizing the patriarchal family requires us to take seriously the idea that we should extend the thousands of laws privileging married people to all people, married or not.  And we need to look at possibilities for more communal child-raising, where community institutions like schools and daycares are expanded to play a larger role in decision-making for children, allowing young children more opportunities to grow and develop free from their abusive controlling parents and in the care of trained professionals. \n\nOur concepts of parental control and ownership of children are left over from the days when kids were economic assets to parents, to work your farm or be sold into slavery, or to care for you in old age.  We now have child labor laws, and all your kids will do for you in old age is visit nursing homes with you which will be paid for with medicare and medicaid anyway.  It is time to change our laws to adapt to the changes our culture has already brought.  Excerpts:   \n\n>Let us briefly survey the scene. Abusers everywhere are battering and molesting their partners and young relatives in the privacy of their properties with increased impunity, since it is more difficult than ever, physically and financially, to flee a home...    \n>  \n>\\[The nuclear family should be\\] the principal object of feminist and queer radical critique. And here, critique really means critique: recognition that the family as we know it is, simultaneously, an anti-queer factory for producing productive workers, rife with power asymmetries and violence, and the sole source of love, care, and protection against the brutalization of the police, the market, work, and racism, many of us have got...  \n>  \n>‚ÄúThinking about organizing intimacy and care beyond the family is less about taking away safety and coziness than it is about extending those very same conditions to everyone regardless of how they live and love.‚Äù The goal is ‚Äúa society where mutual nurturance and support are not dependent on a genetic lottery.‚Äù...  \n>  \n>‚ÄúTreat your neighbors as family‚Äù is a popular and well-meaning sentiment... It happens to be utterly wrong. We must treat each other, instead, with all the tenderness and responsibility due to strangers or, dare I say, comrades.']"

This year is the 50th anniversary of the first L.A. Pride, when LGBTQ people gathered on Hollywood Boulevard to protest police brutality and oppression to our community, and the 51st anniversary of Stonewall. The normal L.A. Pride parade was cancelled last month due to Coronavirus, but the march will now happen in its place.

I'm in NYC and god damn do we need to do this. Every city needs to do this. Not a parade, not the normal yearly celebration with floats and politicians and sponsors, a march in solidarity against police brutality. 

Last year about 5 million people attended Pride weekend in Manhattan alone, for the 50th anniversary of Stonewall. It was the largest LGBTQ event in history, including a twelve-hour parade with 150,000 pre-registered participants among 695 groups.

The first Pride was a riot, started and largely fought by LGBTQ people of color. The 51st anniversary of that riot will be Sunday 6/28.

Yes, community led efforts can be frustratingly slow and disorganized to get started, but they also endure in ways heavy handed efforts can\'t.\n\nWhen the pandemic reached my country, I started wearing a mask in public before it was mandatory.

Strong groups that can advocate real hard for themselves . I think we are on the verge of something new in the radical queer movement (new energies finally) and that we have to talk internationally because resistance is already in place as the article says!!\n For example we in France have the same type of problems. We don\'t have clinics but if you are trans you can go with the ""official transition system"" who takes place in the public hospital. It\'s actual nothing really official it\'s just a bunch of retarded psychiatrist and doctors that got together 25 years ago and decided to be the rulers on trans health. And the people who attend of course don\'t pay but they can wait years for hormone therapy with the Real Life Test and you can\'t be non binary it doesn\'t exist you have to be strongly male or female to get in the program, with not so long ago stupid tests on how masculine or f√©minine enough you were, how you walk how you talk. How you fuck, are you straight, gay/lesbian/queer/ trans is out of the question. Everything is policed every aspect of your gender identity is scanned and if it doesn\'t fit with the heterosexual vision well you don\'t get to your hormones or some operations you may want. The doctors at the top of this program is fighting since many years the fact that trans people don\'t rely on them anymore, they even created a lobbyist organization called Sofect or maybe the changed names recently to push the idea of how perfectly they treat trans people and to fight what was going on, like the creation of queer  health organizations in various cities that went to speak to doctors in town (GP\'s) trained the doctors on how to treat and welcome a trans patient. We although created safe space for trans\' people and queers too in medical by launching a safe health doctor website with various specialties, and in Paris there is one trans health clinic but it\'s doesn\'t go beyond hormone therapy and councelling. (which is is really great). \nThe French health system forces us to use the liberal system because each of the safe doctors don\'t work in the public hospital. \nWe need surgeons that will not take a fucking load of money for top surgery, we need surgeons because trans women don\'t get operations in France they all go to Tha√Ølande and the one\'s that stay in France the poor one\'s well the results are not really satisfying its improved but women still get butchered in 2021..\nPeople stash hormones around here (France) and pass it to the ones in needs. We even have a system with a northern African country we have contacts with to pass some hormones because it\'s nearly impossible to get there. \nIn some cities we have (we the radical queer movement) developed some diy insurance system so even though in France you have health insurance for everyone so drugs are basically free, but you can\'t access to a certain type of doctors. If you are poor you will be poorly treated. Or money will be demanded. \nSo theses insurance system (I guess there are two in France that I\'m aware of) work mostly in the matter of like if some people with no money need to go to a a specialist (it\'s costs money in France if it\'s not in the public hospital) like psychologists, bone doctors, dentist, glasses etc.. \nWell the insurance system is a solidarity program where some put money and the one\'s in need take it. It\'s pretty simple even though it\'s not.. A lot of questions before launching around class and who taked decisions... \nAnd I guess it works for rent too. Because I guess the thing that I would have liked in the article is to talk a little more of the socioeconomic difficulties that trans people come across with and that it\'s a very big problem that trans\' people don\'t have jobs to pay for living at first.\nIn a capitalist system if you don\'t have diy or grassroots organizations that can\'t take in and support the one\'s that are cast out because of  not fitting in whit cis heterosexual mould well people would just die even more, than they are already. \n\nSi I\'m pleading for international Diy Trans Gathering on Health, that could be interesting? \n\nThanx for reading', 'well that article isn\'t very accurate - first of all its not ""occupied Ireland"", it\'s Northern Ireland. second, the writer uses complicated language to distort what they\'re trying to say which is ""socialised healthcare is bad."" Yes, the NHS GIC system isn\'t perfect but the important thing is that SRS isnt determined by how rich or poor you are to afford it. Trans people in developing countries might not ever be able to afford hormones and surgery wheras in the UK its very accessable.']"

The Right and Trump are making sure those changes stay for good.**\n\n>**Trump‚Äôs Department of Health and Human Services is seeking to pass a regulation that would allow doctors to refuse to treat transgender patients, even as Covid-19 continues to kill thousands of people.** Their plan is to interpret existing sex nondiscrimination law in a regressive, unscientific way and claim that trans people are not covered by it. These attempts to remove trans people from civil rights laws are not new. The Trump administration has tried to redefine and reinterpret healthcare laws against marginalized people for years. It has also tried to keep trans students out of school sports by claiming that education nondiscrimination laws apply only to cis students and not to trans ones. \n\n>Even the UN rejected Trump‚Äôs plan to exclude trans people from an international LGBT rights campaign. Now during the pandemic, these attacks on trans rights have become an even more deadly threat.\n\n>Trans people are disproportionately poor, owing to rampant discrimination in society. Even **before the pandemic, nearly half of trans people in the United States were at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Trans people were unemployed at four times the rate of the general population.** Now all that is even worse. Many trans people are in low-wage, ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù jobs in places like grocery stores and fast-food restaurants, and these jobs put them at increased risk of exposure to the virus. Many more have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, making their access to housing, food, and medicine even more precarious. Still others who live with parents who mistreat them are now stuck inside with them and unable to access the in-person support that they may have previously gotten from friends, LGBT centers, and such. Trans adults also frequently lack social support because of society‚Äôs bigotry and pervasive devaluing of trans lives and trans people‚Äôs value as human beings.\n\n>Furthermore, a life of poverty and systemic oppression has left many trans people with chronic health problems and little or no access to health care to treat them. This puts many trans people at increased risk of serious illness and death from the virus. According to one study, about a quarter of all trans people in the United States have fair or poor health. Multiple studies have shown that all LGBT people are at increased risk for a variety of health issues, primarily because of systemic oppression. This includes well-known diseases like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, but also other chronic illnesses that may go undiagnosed for many years.\n\n>On top of the overcrowded, understaffed, and poorly supplied hospitals, trans people face further danger during the pandemic. Denial of care, harassment, and inappropriate behavior by staff in health care settings has long been a problem for trans people, and it is only heightened now. In the high stress and trauma environment of a pandemic emergency room, trans people could find (and some likely have found) themselves either denied care completely, or deprioritized compared to cis patients by doctors who don‚Äôt value trans lives. Trump‚Äôs new rule would make this legal.\n\n>Some trans people simply don‚Äôt mention being trans to the doctor in order to avoid discrimination or mistreatment by staff, and to ensure that their health concerns are taken seriously. But medical records may contain information on hormone therapy, trans-related diagnoses, or past surgeries that could indicate a person‚Äôs trans status. For some trans people, being trans is visibly apparent, so it may not be possible to hide, especially if one has been sick and unable to keep up with grooming, makeup, or other ways that people can influence their physical appearance.\n\n>Even in states where discrimination against trans people will remain illegal despite the new Trump rule, laws can only do so much, especially in a society that puts profits over people. There is no one in the ERs to enforce nondiscrimination laws, and reporting on trans discrimination in hospitals is extremely difficult because the people who do the discrimination are also the people who control patients‚Äô records. They could easily keep the fact that a patient was trans and that they failed to provide proper care out of the official records, which will surely be scrutinized even less than usual during the pandemic.\n\n>Claims of religious beliefs are not the only excuse used to deny trans people care. It has always been legal to deny care to people simply because they are too poor everywhere except emergency rooms. As discussed above, poverty has a disproportionate impact on trans people. Additionally, doctors will sometimes refuse to treat trans people because they say they don‚Äôt have knowledge or experience with trans patients, even though the vast majority of trans people‚Äôs medical needs aren‚Äôt any different from those of cis people. This is yet another way that some providers deny care with no legal consequences.\n\n>The Far Right has long tried to use attacks on trans rights as a wedge to further dismantle our human and civil rights, especially those of all LGBT people and all women. For example, in Arkansas the state government is using the pandemic as an excuse to keep people who need an abortion from getting one. Electing Biden or any neoliberal politician who isn‚Äôt Trump isn‚Äôt going to stop all this. The only way for working class, poor and marginalized people to stand up to these attacks on our rights and well-being is to organize independently through solidarity. Together, we must fight for a society that puts people over profit, a society in which no one‚Äôs needs are ignored or denied, no matter how much of a minority they might be‚Äî a socialist society free of exploitation and oppression.', 'This is blatant social murder.']"

Many will try to leave the country, while those who do not have that chance will face daily humiliations.**\n\n>‚ÄùIn Hungary, you need to show your ID to rent a bike, buy a bus pass or to pick up a package at the post office. It basically means coming out as trans to complete strangers, all the time. The good version is they are nice about it, but there are situations where people turn quite hostile,‚Äù said Ivett √ñrd√∂g, a 39-year-old trans woman living in Budapest.\n\n>**Hungary‚Äôs anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has prompted a wave of international criticism during the coronavirus pandemic by adopting legislation that allows him to rule by decree indefinitely.** Parliament is still sitting, but instead of focusing on fighting coronavirus, it is dealing with issues such as the new trans legislation.\n\n>**Bernadett Sz√©l, an independent MP who has opposed the law in parliament‚Äôs judicial committee, described it as ‚Äúevil‚Äù and ‚Äúa step back in time‚Äù. During a hearing in the committee, she tried to read out a letter from trans people explaining how harmful the law would be for them, but was shut down by the committee‚Äôs chair, who described the letter as ‚Äúnot relevant‚Äù.**\n\n>Sz√©l also criticised the timing of the bill. ‚ÄúWe have a pandemic going on and all of us should be focusing on two things: healthcare issues and helping people financially to secure their wellbeing. What is happening in Hungary is a scandal,‚Äù she said. It is not clear when the bill will be put to a vote, but observers say its passage through committees suggests the government is pushing ahead with it.\n\n>The law also opens up the possibility that it could target people who have already made a legal change and now live with a gender that does not match their ‚Äúsex at birth‚Äù, the planned new gender category on official documents.\n\n>‚ÄùWe think it‚Äôs likely that they don‚Äôt plan to go after people who already changed, but we just don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Tam√°s Dombos, a board member of the H√°tt√©r Society, a Hungarian organisation focused on LGBTQI rights.\n\n>**Legal experts say the new law will be in violation of European human rights case law, leaving it open to challenge in both the Hungarian supreme court and the European court of human rights (ECHR).**\n\n>‚ÄùThere‚Äôs very clear case law on this in the ECHR, so it‚Äôs very likely it will be challenged soon after it‚Äôs implemented. But the court takes years, and the decisions are always individual. People will probably get compensation but it won‚Äôt mean they get new documents,‚Äù said Dombos.\n\n>Until 2016, the procedure for legally changing gender in Hungary was fairly straightforward, said Dombos, but for the past three years, authorities have been reluctant to implement the law, meaning there is a backlog of people waiting for decisions on their applications for gender changes. ‚ÄúMy request has been sitting there for a year, and this new law will mean it will be fully rejected,‚Äù said √ñrd√∂g.\n\n>**Orb√°n‚Äôs government has become more hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community in the past two years, moving from generic language about traditional values and the benefits of heterosexual marriage to openly discriminatory language, such as comparing homosexuality to paedophilia.**\n\n>‚ÄùThis kind of language was not present before, and now it is no longer just discourse, it‚Äôs going to become policy,‚Äù said Dombos.\n\n>Although it will still be possible for people to change their names, in Hungary there is an official register of allowed names compiled by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and this list is gendered. There are no names approved for both genders. ‚ÄúI cannot change my legal name to anything that doesn‚Äôt give me away as a trans person,‚Äù said √ñrd√∂g.\n\n>Even without the new law, life for trans people in Hungary is filled with obstacles. Amanda Malovics, a 30-year-old trans woman, left Hungary in 2015 for London, with one suitcase and enough money to last a month, she said, as she felt uncomfortable starting her transition in Hungary.\n\n>In Britain she has changed her name by deed poll, which means that bank accounts, bills and the rest of her life in London can be conducted under her new name. As soon as she needs to travel, however, she is faced with using her Hungarian passport with her old name and gender. She applied to change her gender in Hungary last year but, like others, has had the application stalled.\n\n>‚ÄùI live and breathe as a woman, I look like a woman, I am present in myself as a woman and I identify as a woman, but my ID says otherwise. I absolutely hate travelling, because of this. There‚Äôs massive fear and anxiety every time,‚Äù she said.\n\n>Now, she says, she is waiting until she qualifies for UK citizenship to receive a passport in her new name, and at that point will consider making the difficult decision to revoke her Hungarian citizenship. She believes many other Hungarian trans people will also leave.\n\n>‚ÄùIt‚Äôs pointless for me to belong somewhere where I‚Äôm not wanted or welcome,‚Äù she said.\n\nEdited', '> Hungary‚Äôs rightwing government looks likely to push through legislation that will end the legal recognition of trans people by defining gender as ‚Äúbiological sex based on primary sex characteristics and chromosomes‚Äù\n\nSo are they really going to karyotype test every newborn to help determine gender under this law?

318,"Advice for finding a roommate (in MN), internalized prejudice, and trauma","Tl;dr: I probably have PTSD, but I still want to Uhaul with a stranger like an absolute idiot bc I can‚Äôt afford two beds, don‚Äôt want to sleep on the floor, and am a lot less afraid of the queer community than the general population of apartment seekers. How do I stop being prejudiced against people my brain sees as aggressive because they present in some way like cis-guys? This is a stupid problem that shouldn‚Äôt exist. 

I need a roommate this summer because I need to work and can‚Äôt do that at home without exposing someone more vulnerable than me. I figured I could be spontaneous and ‚Äúlive within my means,‚Äù and still have a good time, but I might be getting into a bad situation.
This might have been dumb, but I posted a few adds for it on Lex. I feel like an ass, but I‚Äôm really scared that the people who responded are gonna hurt me somehow, or that I‚Äôll accidentally hurt them. I think I have PTSD from a past situation, and because of that I‚Äôm *really* afraid of people who have aggressive responses to stuff. Even when it‚Äôs a healthy way to express anger, I just can‚Äôt help but being afraid of them. 
It‚Äôs given one of my ex‚Äôs dysphoria before, because she thought I was perceiving her as a guy (not blaming her at all, she was really understanding and it was just a shit situation where I probably was on some level). 
Obviously I‚Äôm afraid of the normal online stuff (rapists and liars and scammers), but I‚Äôm also afraid I‚Äôm going to do this with someone and spiraling into a ‚Äúneither party is at fault, but they fucked each other up really bad‚Äù situation. I‚Äôm a really direct communicator, I love being dedicated to another person, and I love feeling really known by someone while at the same time feeling that you both can respect that you‚Äôre different people. I really think it would be so fun and healthy to date someone casually, because I love people and I love the kind of solidarity you get through an intimate relationship. 
But I hate how scared I am of strangers, especially when they look or act ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù (which I know is what rooted in a thousand harmful things, including prejudice against groups I‚Äôm in). 
There‚Äôs this nice ‚Äúcrowlike‚Äù (?) person I‚Äôve talked a bit with who called me handsome (A+, I will topple a nation for them) and seems extremely cool. They even draw comics and are non-binary and my age... but I‚Äôm still scared as fuck. Even after I take my usual precautions to trust a dating app person, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll fuck it up for other reasons. Once, a good friend had her SO over and screamed at some point while I was in the shower, and I totally freaked out on them just getting loud laughing at memes. I haven‚Äôt been able to see her boyfriend (a really sweet queer guy) the same way since, and I hate it so much. I‚Äôm constantly on guard around him, and he literally never did anything but kindness to me. 
I guess my questions are:
- If it is just irrational prejudice, how do I stop? I can absolutely see how it probably is, but I still get afraid when people, for example, generally pass as men. I hate that so much. I know not all men are aggressive, and it‚Äôs making my own transition hell. 
- How do I get a roommate I‚Äôm not scared of who will live in the worst apartment with a queer person? 

I know a confused ‚Äúex-lesbian‚Äù with untreated gender and sex related trauma, PTSD, and everything else you can dig up on my posts is just the perfect person to talk to about TERF shit, so just an FYI I will block and report you. Comrades only.",g4npkp,22,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/g4npkp/advice_for_finding_a_roommate_in_mn_internalized/,"['Honestly, we\'re taught stranger danger from a young age and then it\'s drummed into us through the propaganda. It\'s designed to make us as afraid of each other, and especially of poor people, while we\'re told people who are more than likely going to be rich sociopaths are ""heroes"" (ie: tony stark, bruce wayne). \n\nFor your PTSD, are you able to get medical care, particularity medication? I know things like pot are more affordable but of course they unnecessarily stigmatize that (and rented housing can have ""no smoking"" laws). So, an anti anxiety meds might help you be less anxious. \n\nAs for how to select a roommate, I think you should be vetting them the same as you would be vetting anyone who you would consider living around.', ""hey. i'm sorry you're struggling with this. i can tell that you're a strong person, based on all that you've been through, and housing struggles are the last thing you deserve!!! you definitely deserve a safe place and a safe roomie, if you so desire. it doesn't matter what you've been through or what you prejudge; you deserve that.\n\nfirst up, your prejudice is not irrational. it's very rational to fear situations that have led to bad outcomes in the past. you name a number of bad experiences, so this isn't prejudice, it's survival instincts. those aren't irrational, they're essential. please be kind to yourself for doing what you've had to do in order to survive!\n\nnext, housing. housing is just terrible, even if you aren't queer or rad like us. it's a really big commitment, and it's hard to get to know someone well enough before we make the commitment. one thing you might try is having a friend-date with potential future roomies in order to like vibe check them & make sure they aren't red-flag hard-passes. a public place, like a coffee shop or park or something, usually works best (even if it's hard to meet in public due to The Rona).\n\none last thing to consider is hey, maybe just get a place for yourself for now & worry about finding the roommate later! of course living alone is expensive, but so is having a roommate, when you figure in all the time & emotional labor it takes to maintain any relationship, really. what if you got your own spot & got a pet or something & consider it an investment in your own happiness & well-being until you find that perfect partner/roomie! remember, you deserve it!\n\ntl;dr: you aren't doing anything wrong, these are just legitimately difficult issues! please be patient with yourself!"", 'I think your issue here is bigger than just your current situation.  It seems like they are almost separate issues, you need a roommate and you have a deep seeded trauma that you need to process probably with therapy. \n\nI have ptsd, it is awful and I am sorry you are struggling. Mine comes from medical abuse, and I could barely smell a hospital like cleaner without flashbacks. It took a long time and a lot of work to be able to tolerate medical help without it causing big emotional distress, and reading this it really seems like youre in a place where I was. I think you can and you will get to a point where it isnt all horrifying when you come into contact with people who have certain triggering traits. \n\nThat being said? It wont happen by summer. And IMO recovering from this enough shouldnt be what you focus your living situation on and instead find someone who you could live with as you are now.\nMy advice would be to aim for safe person to share space with. When you are avoiding trauma, it is okay go stereotype a bit in your selection.  Maybe specifically look for a femme who dates femmes or an ace roomie or an older roomie who wont cycle hookups or relationships through your living space. \n\nPersonally I also think disclosing your situation to your roommate is a good idea. Ultimately it is your choice and you dont owe anyone an explanation, but seeking out someone understanding and respectful can go a long way. \n\n\nThis is all just my thoughts, whatever you end up doing I hope it works out as best as they can and that you have the support you need to work on your mental health']"

We're about to be facing a major crisis as people face inability to pay rent whether they want to or not and the potential for responding to that reality with organized rent strikes is an important conversation to have. But a social media posts with no organizing attached doesn't strike me as the way to start that conversation; it runs the risk that people who don't understand how a rent strike functions simply acting as individuals and subsequently suffering negative consequences as individuals. \n\nWe need to address the reality of what it will take for a rent strike to succeed. If 100 people refuse to pay rent and they all have different landlords, they're all going to get screwed. If 100 people refuse to pay rent and they all live in the same building with the same landlord, they have much more leverage; it's a much higher burden on that specific landlord to pursue eviction, and they're in a much better position to physically defend themselves as a community. The success of a strike isn't about raw numbers from viral social media posts, it's about how the *positioning* of the individuals performing a strike *together* changes who has the leverage. I'd love to see a strikes for rent and mortgages, and I'm glad to see them being talked about; solidarity with the many who are about to be *unable* to pay rent is important, and now is probably a better time than any other in recent history to gain traction for such a movement. But what this discussion needs to inspire isn't a bunch of disparate individuals refusing to pay rent as individuals (and then subsequently getting evicted), but a bunch of disparate individuals to **organize** and mobilize locally, into **groups** that are concentrated enough to have an impact when they refuse to pay en masse.\n\nA post simply telling people to strike does little good and may bring harm to those who want to get involved but don't know what that means. But if we're going to talk about rent strikes for the sake of all that is good please include information to help people get educated and organized. \n\n**Do not** rent strike as an individual trying to show support; that's not a strike, it's a fast path to eviction.

351,[Suicide CW] Can I vent about the Wilson Gavin situation for a minute?,"Because I am *pissed* rn and need a group who will listen without giving me grief for being insensitive. Because admittedly, I absolutely am being insensitive, but there‚Äôs some sinister undertones to how this fiasco is being handled on social media that is going unacknowledged.

tl;dr: Career ‚Äòpiece of shit‚Äô dishes out harassment, cops backlash for it, takes own life, now everyone‚Äôs tone policing local queer people.

Some background. All of this is going down in Australia. A Rainbow Families group held a diversity storytime at my city‚Äôs library a couple days ago, the reading done by some local drag icons (including prominent LGBT activist Johnny Valkyrie). A university club for the youth arm of our biggest right-wing party crashed the event with no warning, surrounded the families, and chanted ‚Äúdrag queens are not for kids‚Äù.

The children were terrified and crying, the library staff were effectively helpless with only a security guard to push back with, and the whole thing turned into a social media mess. Parents who attended said they couldn‚Äôt remove their children from the situation until the group was cleared out and safely away from even the exits outside. Someone took out a camera (shoutout to the dude muttering ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt film me‚Äù over and over again, clearly wetting himself because someone was recording them making kids cry), and local queer media was all over it. People flocked to the university club‚Äôs (now deleted, I think. I can't see it anymore) FB page to make their anger known, and the university received a number of complaints calling for the club's discipline. A bunch of LGBT-oriented pages put out reminders of suicide hotlines, saying to connect with them if the furor was leaving us in crisis mode.

Well, it came out a few hours ago that the leader of the university club, Wilson Gavin, jumped in front of a train this morning. This event was not the sole problem in his life by a long shot. He came under fire around November for his involvement in a racist video created by the the Gold Coast youth arm of the political party, and allegedly, he lost friends over it, even some of the moderates in the party. The uproar over the storytime was likely just the catalyst that pushed him over the edge. Importantly though, apparently he was, in fact, gay. I had never heard of this before his suicide, but I‚Äôll assume it was true for now. Presumably, he felt he no longer had a place in either his political party nor the queer community he'd alienated, and thus, no real other place to go.

Now, this is unambiguously *not how things should‚Äôve ended*. It is tragic that he was driven to suicide, and in a better world, he would‚Äôve gotten the help he needed instead. But on the other hand, the social media response has me infuriated. Everyone‚Äôs backtracking, saying what monsters *we* are for the social media mob, and how we should‚Äôve been kind to him and helped him with his internalised homophobia instead.

The whole thing reeks of victim blaming to me. Need I remind everyone that I saw multiple posts about suicide hotlines over his little protest? How quickly people forget that he made a fucking *career* out of harassing minorities, from racial to gender. One parent who was there talked about it on FB saying she was concerned for future Rainbow Families events, ‚Äúwhat if they have guns next time?‚Äù. How many of us suffered and were driven to crisis point over his bullying, and how many trans murders were egged on by attitudes and events like his? For many of the children present, who were mostly under the age of 5, this was likely their first experience of serious LGBT hatred in their young lives, and they will now carry this day with them for the rest of it. Being cornered by a hate mob chanting slogans at you is traumatic for anyone, but especially for a group of children coming from marginalised families.

But now, thanks to ‚Äònever speak ill of the dead‚Äô and it being a suicide, all anyone can talk about is how mean *we* were to *him* and ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù-ing the issue. This includes all the usual canards about how we need to defend free speech even for those we disagree with (which, fuck off, attacking trans people is not ‚Äúdisagreement‚Äù). This whole event is the perfect example of transphobes being unable to take what they dish out. We face online hate mobs, death and rape threats, our video games and other creative output get review bombed, our opinions subject to well poisoning when we speak out, we get doxxed, etc. just for existing by people like Gavin. And now everyone wants me to show my abusers pity and ‚Äúbe nicer‚Äù because he got a taste of his own medicine for once in his privileged life?

I refuse. If you dedicate your political life to abusing people, you get no sympathy when you are abused right back (still only receiving a fraction of the everyday harassment your targets receive!). I will not ‚Äúbe nicer‚Äù to people who dehumanise and attack me because there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôre battling their own issues. That is not my problem to deal with, and demanding I go to that emotional labour is a silencing/tone policing tactic I have no patience for.

It *is* tragic how things turned out, but our sympathies should always lie with the rainbow families who were cornered and intimidated, not those who did the cornering. Passing the blame for his suicide onto those he dedicated his life to hurting is disgusting and unacceptable. The issue of social media mobbing for even 'good' causes is an important one, and we need to discuss it at some point, but this ain't it, chief.",eo5k76,124,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/eo5k76/suicide_cw_can_i_vent_about_the_wilson_gavin/,"['To paraphrase the incomparable Bette Davis: Mother always said that you should never speak ill of the dead, only good.

However, without context, I don‚Äôt really know your situation. If you‚Äôre just looking for people to read, here are some, but this list is neither exhaustive nor inclusive in a trans national sense. Some of my favorite writers are Audre Lorde, bel hooks, Sunaura Taylor, Eli Clare, and Theresa Warburton who have a decent amount of accessible work, so feel free to check her out too, and ask me whenever for a bigger list. I think what‚Äôs a lot more important is activism, and I can explain that here. \n\nRadicalism is a really big process, and I don‚Äôt really think most people are ever in a position to be done getting radicalized. There are a lot of different veins of leftism, and as you can see in this comments, there‚Äôs a lot of infighting. Part of the difficulty of ‚Äúbeing radial‚Äù is that there are so many conflicting ideologies, and in order to be able go defend your ideas against every corner you have to get absurdly versed in theory.\n\nHowever. That, from my perspective, that isn‚Äôt really a problem. Imagining what a truly radically just society would look like is not something I think we can do completely successfully. So much of our language is spoken communication is based on cis/het/white/abled/anthropocentric/etc binaries, and strictures, you can really see how different such a society would be. It‚Äôs obviously a thing to strive for, but the many routes to getting there (while not at all equal or all just/sustainable) rarely impact an individual‚Äôs radical impact, especially in veins of leftism which intentionally avoid hierarchy (anarcho-communism/socialism of many forms). \n\nThat‚Äôs why, as important as theory is, I think activism is really the most effective form of radicalism and personally feeling solidarity. You‚Äôre here, you know we all benefit and are hurt unjust hierarchies and systems of oppression. Creating better systems and working to fight these ones is both empowering and really helpful! I don‚Äôt know where you live, but there are pipeline fights around the world right now led by indigenous people, anti-war campaigns, just food distribution networks, housing justice initiatives, and so much more, being involved can help you build both a personal network of support and solidarity as well as contribute directly to making that better world, even if you aren‚Äôt certain on your theory yet. Experience is just as necessary as book smarts, so go get some :) \n\nThat being said, having really cohesive radical ideas can help you build a network of people already in your life. When you get to a point where you can identify the sources of people‚Äôs frustration and explain their origins in systems like patriarchy, heteronormativity, gender essentialism, class struggle, racism, colonialism, ext, you can help people to gain solidarity and understanding with you. However, that can be really hard. We are all raised and taught according, to some extent, to the false ideas of a nonexistent meritorious society and privileging is harmful discourse. Getting people to see things as they are can be hard, but valuable activism, for a working class person. However, I wouldn‚Äôt make any attempt to form class traitors out of upper middle class and up liberals. There‚Äôs a lot of reasons for that, and I‚Äôd be happy to elaborate another time. \n\nGoing about everyday life as an out radical can be complicated, and in my experience having a friend of two who relates, as well as a group I feel in solidarity with, is extremely helpful. Internalizing radical lib left ideas has been a very (not to be corny) healing experience for me. There‚Äôs a phrase (death culture) that really sums up a lot of the horrors of living under these current systems of oppression. I think theory is really valuable in radical expression, because it can provide you the psychological reassurance of your own validity and goodness when society won‚Äôt do that. This, for me, has especially applied to gender expression, understanding my disabilities, and the subsequent dysfunctional times I often have because this system wasn‚Äôt built for me. However, the only time I ever internalized theory, or was exposed to particularly good theory, was at actions. I highly recommend actually doing praxis, because reading theory is only half of it.\n\nTl;dr: both activism and theory are really important in being publicly radical and accepting yourself, but activism is by far the best way to accomplish both these things.\n\nI wish you luck <3', 'Recycling a comment I have used before: \n\n>I find something so powerful about trying my best to be kind and generous with my time and what I have. No, it\'s not going to cause systemic change, but if I give spare cash to someone asking for it, and someone tries to tell me they are just going to spend it on drugs or that they didn\'t earn it, I tell them that all people deserve dignity and to be taken care of, regardless of what capitalist value they can bring.  \n>  \n>Maybe it\'ll cause a light bulb to go off in someones head. It\'s a lot easier than the uphill battle when you try to explain from the start to someone that you are an anarchist (or an anarchist vegan, that\'s a fun one).

Thank you!",dhqx2v,51,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/dhqx2v/looking_for_some_comrades_to_answer_me_some/,"['I expect theoretical understanding and practical support.\n\nTheoretical understanding is still lacking from a lot, particularly as it relates to the intersectional nature of struggles against oppression. Many new lefties who have come to the left in recent years don\'t have a firm grasp on the relationships between, for instance, misogyny and queerphobia, or cisheterosexism and capitalism. They approach queer folks in a liberal manner, similar to liberal feminism, and think that what is needed is elevation and representation as an end in itself.\n\nI\'ve had a couple experiences where ""leftists"" (mostly Marxist-focused communists) have essentially told me to get back into my place, that the struggle against capitalism is the primary struggle, and that queer liberation needed to take the backseat to class struggle. These are the sort of folks that rail against ""identity politics"" and generally alienate women, poc, disabled, and queer folks.\n\nMy criticism is again mostly related to a lack of theoretical understanding, which then goes on to inform a lack of practical and social support of those of us who are queer.\n\nAs long as capitalism exists, oppression will continue to exist and will in fact expand, as it will be profitable (incentivized) to do so. And as long as it is profitable to oppress people economically, people who are oppressed by cultural norms will be the most oppressed by economic norms. Queer people thus will always be hit doubly by oppression, and the only way we can ever achieve complete liberation is by ending capitalism.\n\nThe left should support all oppressed peoples!', 'Preface: I don\'t really have coherent answers to all of the questions, and I\'m a straight-passing, cis, white, techbro, so my perspective is one from relative privilege.\n\n > What kind of support is still missing? \n\nA lot of people, even on the left, still think that marriage equality was and is the end of the road where sexuality is concerned.  Once you explain what we\'re still lacking, they\'ll agree that it\'s fucked up and be supportive, so I see this strictly as a lack of knowledge.  In any timely expos√©, I would personally like to see discussion of the upcoming SCOTUS cases: [Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/altitude-express-inc-v-zarda/),\xa0[Bostock v.

I know there is a lot of shit going on making it hard to keep on top of things like this, but these cases are incredibly important for our rights and have been nearly ignored by the reddit left.\n\n > Have you experienced some situations where you felt discriminated from the left? Why? \n\nDirectly, no.  Anti-idpol sentiment abounds in some leftist circles, though, which can sometimes read as, ""your structural problems matter less than my structural problems.""  Infrequently, this becomes, ""your structural problems matter so little that they should be completely ignored until we\'ve addressed my structural problems,"" which is bullshit.  ThoughtSlime has a great video addressing this, and I\'ll edit in a link when I find the right one.\n\nEDIT: [Here it is](https://youtu.be/mW4ZAj5Ptqc).  Content warning - referential slurs.\n\n > Do you think it‚Äòs important to abolish capitalism to recieve queer liberation? Why? \n\nI think it is important to abolish capitalism and that it is important to establish queer liberation, but I do not think that either begets or precludes the other.  USSR was horrifically homophobic, and UK provides trans care to it\'s citizens.\n\n > Why should the left support lgbtq+?\n\nSame reasons anyone should - we\'re people doing people things in a people world.', "">What kind of support do you expect from the left?\n\nCalling out homophobia, transphobia (and biphobia, enbyphobia etc) both in public and left wing spaces so we feel able to participate. \n\nSupport for measures to reduce the inequalities LGBT people face (like costs associated with trans healthcare or higher rates of homelessness) \n\n>What kind of support is still missing?\n\nA worrying number of otherwise politically good pepole have -phobic viewpoints and it's not always called out. \n\n> Have you experienced some situations where you felt discriminated from the left? Why?\n\nI've been outed by leftists before. I've also heard quite a few unsavoury comments from other leftists. I know some leftists who share lgbt-hostile material on social media. \n\n>Do you have any criticism to the left in the topic of lgbtq+ support?\n\nThere's a worrying trend of people saying that the left is increasingly pre-occupied with identity politics and this is often used to drive away from identity politics at all. \n\nDo libs love identity politics because it lets them feel righteous while not advocating for real change? Yes. \n\nDoes that mean we can just ignore it? No, because prejudice can still be harmful in a situation where leftist political goals are achieved, and in the meantime protecting minorities from discrimination is still important. \n\n>Do you think it‚Äòs important to abolish capitalism to recieve queer liberation? Why?\n\nEventually, yes. Nobody can be free under capitalism. LGBT people have it bad because we are made to feel unwelcome by society as a whole with widespread low level homophobia as well as outright discrimination and violence, and then spaces where we are safe are generally capitalist ventures. We're also vulnerable to being kicked out of our homes by homophobic parents, have higher rates of mental illness but less resources available to treat and trans people have specific and often expensive healthcare needs. \n\n>Why should the left support lgbtq+?\n\nFeels like an abstract question, like why should we have human rights or why should we strive for fairness? I can't answer exactly but I know we should."", 'Trying to keep this short and sweet:\n\n> What kind of support do you expect from the left? \n\nMainly, an understanding of how capitalism and class politics intersect with oppression based on sexuality and gender, as well as a general acknowledgement & active acceptance of our identities. \n\nWe need our straight/cis comrades to stand up for us, include our voices in the struggle for class liberation and make leftist spaces safe for queer/trans comrades (with our input).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Have you experienced some situations where you felt discriminated from the left? Why? \n\nOnly from class-reductionist tankie types who still treat gender and sexual diversity as ""bourgeois perversion"", even though queer/trans folks are much more likely to be poor or working class and many of us are revolutionary leftists or might at least be sympathetic to the cause. \n\nThose are far and few between, though. Class-reductionism is still a problem in leftists circles, but I don\'t experience it as active discrimination, more as a (often condescending) dismissal of queer-/trans-centric concerns, even when they are urgent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Do you have any criticism to the left in the topic of lgbtq+ support? \n\nSee above. Also, it would be great if Marxist-Leninists in particular would address historical LGBT+ discrimination and human rights violations committed in the name of communism or socialism and do more to disavow those acts and positions. (I\'m actually seeing more and more inclusive Marxism these days, but apologists still exist and it\'s quite alienating tbh.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Do you think it‚Äòs important to abolish capitalism to recieve queer liberation? Why? \n\nI\'d say yes. Under capitalism, human rights won\'t be enforced unless they\'re profitable and while some parts of queer identity and culture can be co-opted to make money, not all of them can. Gender equality, alternate family systems (i.e. anything outside the nuclear family) and non-normative forms of self-expression make marketing and profiteering a lot harder for capitalists, leaving them with no incentive to push for them aside from shallow concessions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Why should the left support lgbtq+? \n\nNot only because all unchangeable identities are inherently deserving of basic human rights, but also because capitalism and cisheteronormative patriarchy are deeply entwined with each other and need to be dismantled together, in my opinion, as it\'s impossible to truly change, subvert or replace a system you don\'t fully understand.', 'I think it‚Äôs weird to separate the left from LGBTQ+ people.\n\nLike, your intentions are maybe good but you‚Äôre still using cis het as the default by making a distinction between the left and queer ppl.\n\nI am the left. I am also queer. Leftist queer spaces are as legitimately The Left as other iterations of community support and organizing.\n\nI don‚Äôt really see the left or the right as homogenous ideological blocks either. It‚Äôs not like writing a letter to the DNC, it‚Äôs just collections of people taking an array of actions, some of whom I fundamentally disagree with and some of whom I can overlook our differences to get shit done.\n\nThat being said, I just want cis het lefties to do their homework the same as I want all cis het people to do their homework. \n\nThere is an abundance of theory and history that explains how class struggle intersects with various identities and how to treat other people with respect and basic empathy.\n\nQueer people have been part of the left since the distinction was made. Queer people have been at the forefront of loads of community organizing initiatives whether that organizing was specifically queer related or not. *So many* of the theorists whose names get dropped by lefty radicals were themselves queer. \n\nI don‚Äôt see the left as something *other* than me and I want cis het lefties to stop seeing queer people as something *other* than them.\n\nAnd yes, I think abolishing capitalism is important for queer liberation for the same reason it‚Äôs important for all liberation.', 'The thing that immediately springs to mind is that the left in general needs to stop being so tolerant of TERFs and their bullshit. The ‚Äòtrans issue‚Äô is not a theoretical debate within the left; it fundamentally concerns a group of people‚Äôs right to exist. Cis leftists need to actually challenge comrades who start spouting transphobia.', ""You might be interested to check out the nascent field of queer/gender nihilsm, which from queer crews I have hung out with is very much informed from a continual marginalisation by the left and social movements, thus embracing a praxis of 'negation'. The writing collective Baeden are particularly good, especially their third book which looks at/through the relationship between James Baldwin and Jene Genet, offering an intersecting queer de-colonial lens and probing Afro-pessimism (which I think resonates loudly with thoughts around queer marginalisation by the left and using 'negation' as a tool to work beyond this). \n\n[Baeden 1](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/baedan-baedan) \\- fantastic, it's dense and very post-structuralist (appeals to some and not others, but is very much worth engaging with if wanting to go beyond liberal queerness)."", '- I expect my fellow leftists to continue to educate themselves on gender, sex, and sexuality (as it‚Äôs an area that‚Äôs growing since it‚Äôs not been studied)‚Äî especially those who‚Äôre cishets. I also expect leftists to understand that I, a white cis lesbian, will have a very different experience from QWOC who‚Äôre trans.  \n- It widely depends on the space. Typically in more Marxist spaces that are sympathetic towards the USSR, some aren‚Äôt willing to accept that nations like the USSR and Cuba have a history of treating the LGBT community like crap. Other spaces don‚Äôt like to discuss how class conflict intersects with issues such as queer liberation. \n- The closest I‚Äôve gotten is there is a subsection who view Identity Politics (and by that they mean discussing how other social issues interest with class) as a problem. They think all forms of discrimination will be solved through the abolishment of class. Which... looking at the history of socialist nations, that line of thinking can be frustrating and isolating. \n- See above‚Äî this idea that focusing completely on class will solve all problems is historically inaccurate at the very least. Insulting at worst.\n- Despite this, abolishing capitalism and class would do things for queer liberation. As while it‚Äôs not the only form of discrimination, class and wealth is a huge tool used to discriminate.\n- I believe leftists should support any cause to free the historically oppressed from the oppressor. It‚Äôs important to put movements into contexts, but this is a good rule of thumb.', ""1. Really whatever is available, as well as just, presence, acknowledgement, and recognition.\n2. We need room to talk about activist burnout, and really relay to as many people as possible that there is hope in some way, shape, or form. \n3. Yes, most definitely. It's semantics, but you could argue a TERF is a leftist or argue that they're right wing and still be kinda correct either way. I see it as understanding the economic tenets of leftism while not really understanding more SJW type stuff. So, brocialists and manarchists and Marxist TERFs, etc. Those ones, who seem to care about Marxism Leninism or whatever more than they care about making the world a better place, or otherwise dismiss the social issues (that are all directly tied to not only capitalism, but society's conditioning as well.\n4. There's a constant need to flush out, or whenever possible, convert brocialists and manarchists who are antagonistic to the LGBTQ population and other minorities. \n5. Yes. Being anti-capitalist does mean opposing reformism, and opposing the trust that liberals have for the free market or for democracy, but small incremental changes in laws and whatnot that make a marginalized community a tiny bit safer, even if it gets rolled back soon after, is still good, reducing the net amount of political violence towards the marginalized.\n6. The right to well-being for all! Equity instead of equality."", '> What kind of support do you expect from the left? \n\nI expect anyone who calls themselves a leftist to be committed to unlearning and healing so that they can show up in more humanizing ways.\n\n \n\n>What kind of support is still missing?\n\nI don\'t think leftists encourage each other to learn the history that brought us all to this point in time, or our personal histories. I think learning these stories puts oppression into context, and prevents narratives from being unknown, misunderstood, or twisted to suit the goals of the oppressor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Have you experienced some situations where you felt discriminated from the left? Why?\n\nYes. I\'m unsure what ""why?"" is asking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Do you have any criticism to the left in the topic of lgbtq+ support? \n\nI think leftists in the USA do not have a historic understanding of gender. The gender binary we live under comes from a specific cultural context that is heavily affected by feudalism, patriarchy, colonialism, and our individual and collective understandings of what it means to have a gender and the roles we associate with genders. I see this lack of understanding actualized in two popular but ultimately distructive arguments: 1) the popularly stated ""gender and biology are not the same"" which is an oversimplified and (in my opinion) pseudointellectual understanding of the relationship between gender and biology, and 2) rewriting history of gender-nonconforming trends outside of our culture\'s ideas of ""gender conforming"" in order to provide evidence to the claim that ""trans people have always existed"" (I see people identify hijra and two-spirit identities for this purpose) even though the concepts of cis and trans as we understand them are specific to our culture.\n\nCurrently, the US Supreme court is hearing cases to determine whether or not civil rights protections in the US apply to trans folks. This is a battle that has been fought long and hard by some of the most marginalized in our communities, but was usurped in the 90\'s by leftists who wanted to fight for marriage equality instead. I wouldn\'t say that marriage equality was a waste of time, just that the movement shifted from gaining civil liberties to gaining government privileges, the latter which pales in comparison to the former. I think a lesson leftists can learn from this is the difference between privileges (cookies from the government) and liberty (actual freedom and autonomy). From my perspective, a lot of leftists are fighting for privileges and not liberty, and as long as they are trying to extend privileges to lgbt folks (instead of fighting to liberate everyone, including themselves), they are going to keep regarding us as less privileged than them. The reality is that we are all lacking in some privilege or another but that doesn\'t matter; the cookies only seem so delicious because none of us are liberated.\n\nJust in general, move away from guilt and shame and move toward humanization. We need to stop objectifying, pathologizing, and dehumanizing ourselves and each other.  \n\n\n \n\n>Do you think it‚Äòs important to abolish capitalism to recieve queer liberation? Why?\n\nI would phrase it: queer liberation is a necessary component in the abolition of capitalism.   \n\n\nUnder capitalism, we are not human beings with personalities and complexities and inherent value; instead we are workers whose value is determined by how much money we produce, for ourselves and for the handful of people who are much richer than us.   \n\n\nHow much money we produce is affected by so many factors--luck, location, family, upbringing, how we physically look, what we are physically and mentally capable of, and how we are perceived by others (I\'m sure that there are many other factors).   \n\n\nIn Marx\'s theory of alienation, he describes how by becoming workers we became objects (we are humans, not workers). We believe it makes sense to be workers even though it\'s crazy as fuck to work so much and receive comparatively little in return.  \n\n\nWe are indoctrinated with shitty justification for why things should be this way. During slavery, the justification was that slaves were not human. In sharecropping, which is practiced in the modern day through the factory farm/agriculture industry, the justification is that the boss provided all the crops so bosses should get all the money.  During industrialization, Social Darwinism was used by barons to justify their wealth. In the modern day, we justify the mistreatment and slave labor of prisoners, factory workers around the world, crop-pickers, undocumented workers, the mentally and physically disabled, and sex workers by promoting these people as the kind of people who somehow deserve to do a lot of labor to make someone else rich while remaining barely (or completely) unable to meet their needs/self actualize.   \n\n\nWe, as in me and you reading this, learned to use the same system of scrutiny that determines our value as workers, to determine our individual human value and the value of others. All of us were taught to be -ist or -phobic in many capacities. It\'s not that we treat people differently, but that *we treat people as inherently lacking in value* based on their background, how attractive they are to us (which is insidious when we are also told what we should find most beautiful), their skin color, their conformity to the gender binary, their manner of speaking, their physical and mental ability... so many things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCapitalism survives off of each of us individually deciding that we are all so lacking in value that we deserve to work our lives away. The narratives surrounding queerdom speak to the way we are seen by society at large. We ""can\'t reproduce"", our very existence is ""against nature"", we are likely to be incarcerated or do sex work, be killed by murder or suicide... as long as we are seeing as inherently lacking in value, it will always be easy to justify our mistreatment. Because capitalism relies on assigning value to human beings in order to determine if their oppression is justified, that element of validation will need to be dismantled in order to dismantle capitalism. As in, we will have to stop seeing people as more or less worthy based on their gender identity, and that is what gender liberation is.\n\n \n\n>Why should the left support lgbtq+?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf my oppression can be justified, so can theirs.', '[there is a good video on this topic by anarchopac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtXIOh1ubo)', ""1) None\n\n2) I don't know.\n\n3) The left, far more than the right, is MUCH quicker to ban, censor, and stifle genuine dialogue and rational debate.

It makes discussion with you guys difficult if not outright impossible.\n\n5) No; Capitalism in conjunction with Democracy is what gives you greater freedom in the first place to be queer.  Try being queer in the Congo, North Korea, Afghanistan etc etc.\n\n6) The left does a good job at fighting discrimination for oppressed people.  Keep that fight going, but don't keep fighting or overextend that fight when there is equality already met... that's when you get pushback from the right.\n\n\\-Vanessa""]"

389,Creating opportunities for radical queer poets to be heard,"Dear poets of /r/radicalqueers,

I'm from a writers‚Äô resources company called Winning Writers. Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes underrepresented in publishing, including (but of course not limited to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body positive, and [dis]abled. We are interested primarily in the representation of the voices/themes in the poetry, rather than the identity of the writer. The [Tom Howard/Margaret Reid Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/tom-howard-margaret-reid-poetry-contest) we are running right now offers two first prizes of $2,000 each. Ten honorable mentions will receive $100 each, and the top twelve entries will all be published on our site. The contest is international and the deadline is September 30. I‚Äôm posting here specifically because part of our long term goal is to change the composition of our entry pool to include more entries featuring diverse characters and themes. These voices need to be heard, and we are actively reaching out to find them. 

Sometimes when I post, there are some replies worried about a scam, so in order to head that off I just want to say that our competitions are listed by The Write Life as some of the [top writing competitions](https://thewritelife.com/writing-contests/) out there, and we‚Äôre in Writer‚Äôs Digest‚Äôs [top eight](https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/top-websites-for-writers-best-publishing-marketing-resources) sites for writers. Besides contests, we also offer a lot of free publishing and style resources, including a database of free poetry and prose competitions, at https://winningwriters.com/

394,Brutal hate crime in Berlin Tiergarten,"I was working in a hotel near the Tiergarten in Berlin and my way to work passed through the park. I usually cycled this way but my bike was broken so I went by feet.

It was my day off and I wanted to visit a dear college when four strangers suddenly came in front of me, one of them asking ""Hey you faggot, you wanna suck my d..k?"" I answered: ""No, thanks!"", the next memory I got is waking up on the ground, the grass was wet from my blood and my head was terribly aching. The rest of my body felt ok, so those four guys just were kicking my head!

I'm lucky that I survived!!


After I was treated in a hospital I had to go to the dentist to find out that two front theet were broken and dead - one had to be removed.


Since that day I have a huge gap in my mouth and severe psychological problems! I couldn't keep on working as a waitor/barman anymore, had to do a trauma therapy and ever since I have to visit a psychotherapist.

I've got a huge lack of self-confidence and it feels like I haven't been laughing since 4 years now...


I'm writing this because I started a campaign on Go Fund Me, because I had to argue with the State Office for Health and Social for three years until they accepted that I became victim of a raid and it was not my fault.

But this wasn't just a raid - this was hate crime and attempted murder...


Now that they finally accepted me being a victim and granted financial help I started a treatment earlier this year. But they only pay for a small part of the operation... the rest is up to me! But I don't have enough money, in fact I'm in dept since I lost my job...


I just wanna smile again! Evertime I'm looking in a mirror or feel the gap with my tongue it reminds me of that terrible evening!
Not that they just ruined my smile and my joy for life, they also took my keys and my wallet (with bank cards and ID), so that I'm living in constant fear - I can't afford to move...

Those four ""guys"" ruined my whole life!


I would be infinitely thankful for everyone to have a look at my campaign page or sharing this! Every tiny donation would mean so much for me!


Here's the link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/nn6jwj-help-me-smile-again


Blessings to all of you and have wonderful days!

431,How do I find sum radical anarcho-friends?,"hi lovers.

Living in this fucking shitstain country is making me physically and mentally sick. I have no friends that I live near and no one to chill with and talk about shit that matters to me. I'm surrounded by mindnumbing apathy and banality everywhere, people consistently depressing me with their numbness and lethargy and deterrence and lack of will to be or do anything interesting or even have sex or anything.

I'm currently living in Denver but I need to get the fuck out of this city. I'm trying to decide on somewhere to move. I'm pretty open to suggestions. I'm thinking maybe the East Coast where I have some friends.

Just wondering like, how do I find some IRL radicals to being friends with and help me not fall back into suicidal depression by being something interesting in my life? Anyone have any advice to offer. Thanks loves.",bwh0ru,25,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/bwh0ru/how_do_i_find_sum_radical_anarchofriends/,"['Sometimes meeting anarchists/leftists can be very difficult, especially with security culture. It sucks. Not gonna lie.\nThat being said, here are some tricks to finding these spaces. Requires some research, patience, and social skills if you don\'t have an ""in"" through an established friend.\n\n1. [Check out local anarchist and leftist spaces](https://slingshotcollective.org/colorado/). Sometimes Google keywords like anarchist +bookstore or whatever will get the goods, but Slingshot keeps a decent directory. Look for a community board with events coming up, local orgs meet ups, etc. Strike up conversations with people who work there or hang out there.\n\n2. Check out local punk shows. Yes, sorry, I know not everyone is into punks and not all punks are actual anarchists, but even when I couldn\'t find a local org to work with, the punks knew where to direct me and were decent community support. YMMV.\n\n\n3. Look for orgs like Food Not Bombs. FNB chapters are typically run by anarchists and usually network with local groups. Prison Abolition networks are much the same. Now, you experience may be different, but ime many other anarchist (and other leftists tbf) groups have a high turn over/burn out rate for a variety of reasons. Usually I see the same group of anarchists forming and reforming groups as needed, adding new people as time goes on and kicking out toxic people (hopefully) as well.\n\n4. Consider looking into multitendancy orgs that aren\'t specifically your brand of leftism. Pretty sure there\'s a socialist org in Denver (not DSA, though I\'ve known a few folx to work with the DSA libertarian caucuses, I\'m personally not a huge fan) at the very least, given that a big socialist conference was held in Denver last fall, featuring Boots Riley as a speaker.\n\n\nThat being said, I can\'t say the anarchist community is too organized in Philly atm, but it\'s pretty big and there are a fair amount of leftists in general here, so that\'s a decent east coast place to visit.', 'i live in tucson and feel pretty much the same way politically‚Äîi found an anarchist black cross group of like 6 people but that\'s it. i literally just looked ""[city name] + anarchist"" but i assume youve already done that. maybe start volunteering for radical-adjacent groups, make connections that way? that\'s all i can think of since im recently new to all this, so... sorry i cant much help, but youre not alone in the struggle to find others', ""Hey love. I'm first gen American and also feel like fuck this I'd like to GTFO. I did leave a southern state to go to the West Coast and even though I love it out here I'm also learning that California is segregated and racist and fucked up the wazoo and that Oregon and Washington are populated by white supremacists. Maybe they're more progressive in some ways; maybe it's just propaganda. I even thought about moving back to the European country where I have citizenship, but that country is also experiencing a fasc wave/takeover. I'm starting to think we all just gotta do the hard work of growing our circles and the movement so that wherever we are there's refuge and freedom. Let's gooo.

438,Sick of Liberals Appropriating Concern for Marginalized Communities,"What I mean by the title is that liberals shilling for the Democratic party, or the liberal alternative in your country, claim to have a monopoly on caring about marginalized communities. If you *really* care about them, you'll *vote blue no matter who*, and if you don't, then you *must* not really care. The extension of this assumption is that all people with marginalized identities agree that liberals are their saviors, or else don't know it yet.

&#x200B;

The liberal caricature of third party voters is an able-bodied, heterosexual, white male Bernie-bro who casts a protest vote because he is too selfish to care about the effects of a Republican victory. Liberals are either unable to conceive of marginalized groups rejecting their candidates, or sincerely believe any marginalized person who *does* reject their candidate just doesn't know what's good for them.

The greatest frustration is that as an MtF who hasn't started HRT yet and doesn't at all pass, I have to suffer through arrogant cisgender liberals telling me I don't really care about transgender people.

I've always loved being American. At least, until now. Donald Trump has utterly destroyed the vision of America I thought would exist when I was growing up. And yet no matter who I talk to, everyone is angry about the state of America- my parents, my friends, my professors- everyone. And yet no one has really talked about protesting, about using our power as Americans to change things. 

I'm really done just sitting around and allowing the United States government to rip apart at the seams while I just do a regular 9-5 job.

Why Are Faggots So Afraid of Faggots challenges not just the violence of straight homophobia but the hypocrisy of mainstream gay norms that say the only way to stay safe is to act straight: get married, join the military, adopt kids! This anthology reinvokes the anger, flamboyance, and subversion once thriving in gay subcultures in order to create something dangerous and lovely: an exploration of the perils of assimilation; a call for accountability; a vision for change.

While a handful of proletarian gays might move to the city and spend their nights in underground dungeons, the ""radical queer"" movement can be very obnoxious and alienates a lot of the proletariat, which happens to be the actual agent of revolutionary change, however much some people want to fetishize declassed petty bourgeois in skin-tight leather.\n\nMind you, I enjoy dressing up and sucking off strangers under blacklights as much as the next guy, but I also know how to adjust my tone and consider where people are coming from and what is realistic.']"

511,"Findings from study on bisexual women's discrimination, resilience, and mental health","Hello there!
A while ago, you may have seen a recruitment add related to bisexual and non-monosexual women‚Äôs experiences of discrimination, resilience, advocacy, and mental health outcomes. I want to thank all of you who took the time to respond to the questions, sharing your perspectives, and entrusting us as researchers. Our research team truly appreciates it! 

You may have found yourself curious about the findings of this study, so I'd like to share with you what we found. More specifically, this study examined the relations among multiple discriminatory experiences (anti-bisexual discrimination, sexism), LGBTQ+ and feminist advocacy, resilience, and psychological outcomes (distress and well-being). Results from the study found that both anti-bisexual and sexist discrimination were related to psychological distress, although LGBTQ+ and feminist advocacy and resilience were related to less psychological distress and greater well-being. In addition, resilience appeared to offset the harmful impact of sexism in relation to psychological distress. So, there's some good support for the importance of advocacy initiatives on one's own well-being (and just in terms of working to create a more just society), as well as developing resilience to aid in coping with discrimination. 

I know several folks provided feedback on this study, also suggesting that level of identity outness (including concealment and disclosure) may have made some of these experiences more or less common. Although we didn‚Äôt include this a variable in the study, we do believe it is an important area of additional research‚Äîas well as bisexual invisibility altogether‚Äîand have suggested it as an area of needed research in our manuscript that was accepted for publication. 

Again, thank you so much for your assistance!

Take good care all!

That said, an queer point of view is of course more than welcome.

We are hoping to find French speakers here who might be interested in subscribing/participating to the sub. Right now the sub is more focused on France, but we would be very interested in learning from French speakers around the world. Everyone is welcome provided you stick to the rules.

522,On the queer bodies,"Queer bodies are not mainstream, they should have never thought to be so. Queer bodies were supposed to show the way of human liberation from Christian sexual morality: marriage, monogamy, sexism, fetishism of reproduction, ... All these values are being fed back into the gay community, resulting in a sense of negligence, apathy and confusion. The means and the goal of the revolution are gone, gay has become gay-friendly, not transcendental to any sort of value, but another tool of domination. 
So we can ""choose"" gay as any other valid option, in some countries, yet the choice itself is not questioned. The real potential of the LGBTQ community lies in the Q; in the free flow of sexuality across experiences, life stages and class. 
Being gay is being white. Race has defined the homosexual worldwide, it has liberated him or her. This is not unique to sexuality, foreign aid has a Post-WWII era history. It was instrumental to stop communism, and it is now useful to feed pre-packed sexualities and bodies. We have no options, we, the non-white but gay, we consume gayness from your platforms and lend out bodies, our queer bodies, to your American and Christian complexes. Gay is tainted, we need a better word, a word that is flesh, that speaks sex, not polirizing. Not for everyone, but neither alien. A secret.

(This probably seems obvious to many, I didn't have a dad growing up? When I think about my experience with the word daddy I've witnessed it more so within my queer community, so maybe that threw me off?)

But what do you think about the term daddy and maybe even ""little girl"" between two adults? Is one more okay than the other? Toxic or not?

For some back story, my SO and I got in an argument about the negative lessons ""teen"" porn engrains in our culture when he pointed out the ""daddy"" dynamic within our own relationship. Am I being hypocritical? Should I rethink my sexual and kinky vocabulary? ",76a84t,33,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/76a84t/am_i_perpetuating_toxic_behavior_by_sexualizing/,"['I\'m so incredibly uncomfortable with ""daddy"" and ""little girl."" To me, they\'re explicitly sexualizing the father/daughter relationship -- and the community associated makes me even more nauseous because, for example, a completely non-sexual Tumblr I followed turned their account into a DD/lg roleplay, so I opened my feed and saw a woman posing as a child (pigtails, skirts) asking for a daddy. I was molested by my dad. That\'s the problem, I think -- everyone knows victims of sexual assault but usually aren\'t aware that they do because it\'s not exactly a topic of casual conversation. Bringing those elements of kink into public is really problematic. And in my opinion, ageplay is not a harmless kink. I don\'t feel capable of getting into a discussion about it right now.', 'Whilst nothing happens in a vacuum, for an action to have an effect on culture it needs to have a means of transmission.\n\nPorn is public by nature. It introduces ideas into the ideosphere, normalises ideas, promotes its values. You\'re not really doing any of those things (presumably). What\'s problematic about ""teen"" porn is the promotion of the value that the younger a person is (or closer to 18, to be generous) the more sexually desirable they are, the more objectifiable they are. It also perverts tropes of innocence, naivete, and trust, in rather sinister ways.\n\nOn a limb I\'m guessing with your own kinky practice you are not promoting anything, nor are you presenting anyone involved as inferior and therefore exploitably vulnerable. There can be a self-deprecation involved, but when you say ""daddy"" it\'s a mark of respect, love, and admiration. \n\nRespect, love, and admiration are profoundly absent from teen porn, and I\'d say that makes all the difference. You do not try to deceive anyone into thinking you\'re younger, you don\'t try to convince someone of an absurd and dangerous portrayal of teenage sexuality, and, hopefully, you don\'t propogate that anyone is fair game for exploitation based on their youth and innocence.\n\nWith all that in mind... I think you\'re perfectly justified in calling out those problems in teen porn which do not intersect with your practice of kink in your relationship (and also that the two have *very little in common*).\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'I have multiple friends who used to be ‚ÄúLittles‚Äù. It took some of them ages to extricate themselves from the DDlg community, but they all suffered absolutely horrible trauma and conditioning from it. Aspects of the dynamic that they thought were totally innocent and harmless at the time (they were all young, under 22, like the VAST majority of littles) ended up crippling them later (dependence on others, a complete lack of ability to pick up on inappropriate behavior, significant immaturity for their age). I have seen SO MANY actual KIDS in this community, teenagers, extremely young adults, people who don‚Äôt understand that they‚Äôre not playing make believe, they‚Äôre fetishizing their own youth and immaturity.\n\nOn top of that, I don‚Äôt give a shit how much someone argues that it‚Äôs two consenting adults. I‚Äôve come across so many ‚Äúscandals‚Äù stemming from the community, on tumblr and on instagram, where people are SHOCKED to find out that a Daddy dom in their midst was a fucking pedophile. That is willful ignorance in my eyes. The community harbors pedophiles and produces content that mimics their interests. Like...adults calling their genitals their ‚Äúno no area‚Äù and ‚Äúprincess parts‚Äù. They are feigning sexual ignorance to reproduce the dynamic of a victim of molestation. That‚Äôs REPULSIVE.\n\nI get that it‚Äôs difficult when you factor in gay male culture. Honestly, I‚Äôm still grossed out by it, but I‚Äôm not bothered as much when my gay friends use it because it stands alone as it‚Äôs own cultural word. I don‚Äôt like it and I would be thrilled if it disappeared from existence. But it absolutely crosses another line when it‚Äôs used relationally. That‚Äôs the thing. I had a ddlger try to tell me it‚Äôs no different than when I call my partner ‚Äúbaby‚Äù because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not literally a baby, it‚Äôs just a word‚Äù. The difference is when I call him baby, he calls me baby in return. He doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúdaddy!‚Äù. That‚Äôs relational. And explicitly, in the word choice, referencing pedophilia whether you like it or not.\n\nAdditionally, and this is one of the grossest parts, you make it actively uncomfortable for people to call their actual fathers daddy. This is sick to me. Literal children being scared of calling their fathers a traditionally innocent name. One of my ex-little friends never thought of it because, like you, their father wasn‚Äôt very present (post-abuse) and they never called him that, so it was something ‚Äúseparate and different‚Äù. The terrible human who made the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù argument to me said things like ‚Äúdaddy has sexual connotations [uhhh yeah where do you think that stems from??], it always has‚Äù. You need to understand that your connotations are not everyone‚Äôs, and literal children are unable to interact with their fathers in certain ways because of the continuing sexualization of the dynamic. That‚Äôs heartbreaking to me.\n\nI‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs being mainstreamed as an aesthetic now too. Forever 21 sells O-ring collars to teenagers. I‚Äôm involved in kink myself, but that‚Äôs fucked up. They also have been selling chokers that say things ‚ÄúBaby Girl‚Äù. That‚Äôs capitalism profiting off the sexualization of young women. It‚Äôs pretty blatant. \n\nI can tell you that as someone who has been groped by their father, ddlgers have made it MUCH harder to process my trauma. Daddy imagery is becoming pretty ubiquitous and it harms people for a million reasons. But it has made me go backwards in terms of comfort and recovery. Just from brief exposure to the community for research, I now can‚Äôt see frilly innocent little girl stuff on actual children without getting a sick feeling in my stomach knowing that Littles are mimicking that style and sexualizing what these children are wearing. I feel sad and hopeless when I see how normalized that sexualization is. \n\nEDIT: Another thing to consider (and something I take very seriously when considering how I speak about my own kinks) is that you can believe that something isn‚Äôt harmful for yourself all you want, but defending these things as unharmful and asserting their normalcy and language centers the broad normalization of the kink over a discussion of what healthy relationships actually look like. Shitty pro-ddlg ex-friend, we‚Äôll call them L, is 26 and involved in the kink. That‚Äôs her right I guess, as much as I think it‚Äôs morally repugnant, but in the process of pushing for acceptance of her kink, she very recklessly assured a 19 year old CSA survivor who identified as a little, and who had been assaulted at 18 by a ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù they met online in the community, that it was a totally normal and healthy and intrinsic kink and to not worry about it or analyze it. As if there was no obvious issue with that. This sort of shit is actually why I can‚Äôt stand most of the BDSM community as a whole. The focus is on normalization and acceptance instead of teaching cultural literacy, self reflection, and a model of what healthy human relationships look like. My partner and I involve kink in our sexual relationship, but the only reason that works is because we are very very healthy, close, and communicative in general. Unfortunately our culture sets people up for unhealthy and gender skewed romantic relationships. I can‚Äôt in good conscience champion the cause of BDSM acceptance when I know it will be implemented in abusive ways. People will always be kinky, and that‚Äôs totally fine, but I‚Äôd rather spend my energy on trying to normalize healthy relationships in general. This turned into a rambly tangent, but the point being that just because you think you can handle your dynamic doesn‚Äôt mean that you aren‚Äôt harming other folks, particularly naive young afab people drawn to the community, by telling them that this is normal.\n\nSo yeah, I understand it‚Äôs a hard thing to disengage from. You have my sympathy there. But you have to if you want to claim you have any moral compass at all. That‚Äôs my view at least. I would never be friends with a Little or a Daddy, anymore than I would be friends with a Trump supporter. ', 'You should probably focus on what you actually *mean* when you call partners that.\n\nA lot of scenarios where people call each other daddy or little girl uphold patriarchy and adultism. In some dd/lg relationships, the relationship emphasizes the ""daddy"" taking care of the little girl.\n\nYou don\'t usually see mommy/little boy relationships because men aren\'t pressured to accept a domineering female figure in their life like women are.\n\nUsing daddy/little girl in the context of culture makes it seem like male/older/above and female/smaller/below in a sense.', '>Am I being hypocritical? \n\nyes. \n\nYou\'re making the argument that seuxalization of late adolesence (""Teen porn"") is inappropriate, while particpating in sexualization of *early childhood* (DDLG kink). \n\ndont act like kinks exist in a vacuum. our sexual behavior is influenced by the world around us - like it or not - and we have to have some awareness of that. ..No im not saying no one gets a say in what they\'re attracted to, but - and i\'m going out on a limb and assuming you\'re a normal person here - if calling your partner ""daddy\' wasn\'t an at least moderately acceptable \'thing\' is this really something you would have come up with spontaniously? \n\nwhats more, for obvious reasons this is a kink you should never bring non consenting parties into... That includes calling your partner \'daddy\' in public... which when youre using it is as a petname, i doubt is a line most people who participate in the kink manage to maintain. CSA is unfortunarely incredibly common and the *complete disregard for trauma* the dd/lg community has as a whole is revolting. strictly speaking i\'m not saying you hate CSA survivors but as a community? ... I have literally never saught out this content but i am regularely bombarded by it when i\'m trying to look up pictures of cute fluffy things....', 'It\'s really pointless and I\'m sad to condemn this imo.  This is literally the world\'s most popular ""fetish"" for fem subbish types of all colors.   \n\n\nLike seriously don\'t start this debate unless you want to make a feminist argument against like a large part of female sexuality.\n\n\nNot to mention that most of the people calling someone daddy are not really age playing.  But if you look at it from a wider aspect there\'s nothing wrong with age playing either.  Many peoples idea of heaven would be to be 14 forever, what\'s technically abnormal according to natural impupses is not having sex after puberty.  Not to mention it\'s more like daddy as in a guy who takes care of everything for you not quite as literally.']"

532,Makeup for men - liberation or exploitation?,"So I'm conflicted about makeup for men and wondered if anyone here had thoughts.

On the one hand I think that wearing makeup is possibly subversive and freeing, challenging traditional masculinity and embracing elements of traditional femininity that have been denied to men. 

I think there is a sexist temptation to see makeup as frivolous and silly because it is traditional a woman's domain and anything connected to women and femininity is inferior. This is an issue in queer communities where femmes frequently receive scorn from other queers and where 'straight-acting' (read traditionally masculine) is a compliment. In this light is wearing makeup emancipatory?

Also, and maybe more simply, I just quite enjoy the way I look and feel when I wear some makeup - it's fun and sexy.


On the other hand  we all see and know the way makeup is part of the patriarchal oppression of women forcing them to feel insufficent without spending lots of time and money trying to live up to illusory, sexist, racist and just generally oppressive standards of feminine perfection. How can it be emancipatory to freely adopt the chains of another group? If men begin to wear makeup is there a risk it becomes expected and oppressive to men? And is there a risk of further entrenching the oppression of women by increasing the social expectation of makeup wearing when we should be supporting women to challenge them.

On top of this there is the fact that we are talking about engaging with an enormous and exploitative capitalist machine - the makeup industry - which is very excited about the new revenue stream from selling to men.

And one last point, if we reject the whole idea of gender being a spectrum between to the two poles of male and female and adopt a queerer idea of gender being any number of potential behaviours and attitudes which one can adopt and create from scratch, then isn't performing elements of traditional femininity, if not actually oppressing oneself, then at least blandly limiting oneself?? ",72kzvu,16,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/72kzvu/makeup_for_men_liberation_or_exploitation/,"['From a femme: make-up can be a a tool, a toy, or a ritual.\n\nIts uses as a tool are to manifest a particular (self-)image, to allow a high-degree of variety/customisability in the appearance of one\'s face, to send a certain message to others, etc. As a toy... because it can be fun. It can allow us to reflect externally what\'s inside, or the opposite, to become a completely different person. In these modes, I think it\'s never limiting or oppressing, it\'s used for a desired effect.\n\nMake-up can be limiting as a ritual, but not always. Dependency on almost anything is bad, and where a person becomes dependent on it, feeling they need it to be presentable, that\'s less than ideal but it\'s their journey and maybe they have bigger things to focus on.\n\nWhere a society says ""boys don\'t wear make-up"", then a boy wears make-up... that can be emancipatory. They\'re definitely allowed to do it, and whilst people are telling them not to, then they\'re claiming something for themselves from an oppressor.\n\nIntentionally not speaking in terms of femininity and binaries, because I don\'t think we need to. The association of make-up with x or y gender is subjective to a particular culture. The man wearing make-up in the west says ""screw that culture, I\'ll do what I want""; the femme wearing make-up in a queer space that maybe hostile to it says ""screw that culture, I\'ll do what I want.""\n\n...So I believe.\n\n', ""It's not an either/or situation. I think make up for men can be both liberating and exploitative, just as it can be for women. "", ""But what about makeup on a feminine body designed to look more masculine? It's a tool to modify ones presentation. Just the same way dresses and high heels can be seen as coming from oppressive gender roles and the heterosexual male gaze, that doesn't mean they can't be liberating for any gender. I tend to originate my principles and identity very internally, it's a question of self-authenticity often before any external input is deemed. ""]"

542,Why Trans Activists Can‚Äôt Trust The Left,,6m6wju,26,13,https://theestablishment.co/why-trans-activists-cant-trust-the-left-3bfa22928ddd,"['While I agree with the essence of this article, I think it suffers from a misplacement of who should be considered radicals, or the \'left\'. If you look at the several anti-pride demonstrations, most of which had a focus on trans discrimination in the LGBT community, most were organised by and composed of black power, anarchist, communist and anti-fascist organisations. These are the tendencies we need to be looking at as representative of progress. They are largely composed of queer people and, while certainly having their own problems, have on the whole maintained consistent support for trans and queer issues. Taking neo-liberal politicians and insular sects that became irrelevant decades ago as representative of the \'left\' is going to paint a bad picture in any context, and bashing it amounts to reasserting the fact that bad politics is bad. If instead we look at those on the cutting edge of progress, we get a much more positive picture that is difficult to paint with the single stroke of ""transphobia"". I dont know what my point is: most of what people consider the left has no \'left\' in it, and most of the actual left is rubbish in all departments, transphobia is more a symptom of a broken politics than anything else. Even the most advanced organisations suffer from a male and cis-domination problem, but I don\'t think the revolutionary anti-capitalist left, which is mostly composed of queer and trans people and has an explicit pro-QT line, can be called transphobic on the whole. ', ""I've literally never met a transphobic or homophobic anarchist, while I'm sure a few might exist, the overwhelming majority of them are some of the most supportive people I've ever met.

592,"Any leads for attorneys, legal scholars, or activists regarding more ""radical"" queer (as opposed to gay or LGBT) family law issues and disputes?","My family (both immediate nuclear family consisting of my parents and siblings as well as other relatives like my parents' siblings and my grandparents) have a long history of making decisions against my well-being and best interests, behaving in deliberate ways that discriminate against me for being queer (because I openly identified as ""gay"" while a teenager and also before that time due to my natural and unintentional behaviors viewed as ""gay"" or queer, such as the tone and inflection of my voice or way of speaking), and abusing me (mostly verbally and also in ways that are threatening physically against myself or my property) in ways that sometimes have been explicitly motivated by anti-gay or anti-queer beliefs (e.g. religious) or sentiments.  

&nbsp;

Because my parents happen to have siblings or other relatives that have not or explicitly said he or she will not get married nor have children, there is money or assets that myself and my heterosexual siblings have voluntarily been told (as far back as I can remember including early childhood even) and made to believe would be passed on to us through wills (and based on next of kin dynamics, would occur by default unless instructions were made out in a will to bequeath money and assets to, say, and charity, which has never been even hinted about).

&nbsp;

Unexpectedly, in recent years my heterosexual siblings have begun to significantly benefit from these assets even though the owners (our relatives) are still alive.  For example, an arrangement (that has not been made fully transparent to me) was made where real estate was purchased essentially for a sibling. In other words, although the deed remains in the names of the relatives as of now, my sibling has lived there the whole time, been allowed to pocket rent when spare rooms were rented out to friends at his discretion (or invited heterosexual partners or girlfriends in the sexual/romantic/dating sense to move in and inhabit the house without paying rent), and it has been said that eventually my sibling's name will be put on the deed and NOT as a result of a regular transaction like purchasing the property at market value.  I again do not know the precise plan, but it has not been ruled out that the house will be essentially eventually ""gifted"" to my sibling for as little payment as they can get away with legally (with  respect to potential tax issues).

&nbsp;

Long story short, I definitely will not be getting any ""gifts"" from family or relatives while they are still alive, and it has been admitted in one way or another than many developments being set up with or for my heterosexual siblings will reduce any inheritance I might receive (in other words, ultimately my siblings and I already are slated to receive unequal or disproportionate fractions or percentages of the estates of family/relatives, and the differentials or discrepancies appear like they will only grow over the for various reasons that are justified by heteronormative explicit beliefs, motivations, and assumptions).  And history has hinted that I am not guaranteed any inheritance based entirely on changes with their moods, beliefs, or other things separate from what I can control.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I am only recently starting to think about this and simply wondering if other queer people can share with me any leads that might be relevant.  I am interested both in leads that might allow me to better understand legal options I should know about to prepare for the future, and I am also very interested in activism or activist leads in order to better identify opportunities to use my personal situation or issues as a queer person with respect to a heteronormative family structure and ideology, in order to possibly assist, affiliate with, or associate with queer activism causes regardless of any tangible effect or help regarding my best interests within my personal matters.  In fact, I would absolutely invest or sacrifice my own assets or financial best interests (to a reasonable degree that does not create too much risk for me in maintaining essential necessities for living) in a trade-off of sorts if I am able to make an impact that appears promising or substantial enough symbolically toward queer activism causes (as well as other causes arguably not directly considered queer per se but still very linked, like issues faced by abandoned or abused youth).  ",51h71b,11,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/51h71b/any_leads_for_attorneys_legal_scholars_or/,"[""I cannot give specific legal advice as I am not a lawyer, but if you're in a forced heirship jurisdiction (eg. Louisiana, Scotland, South Africa, and others), look into the legal doctrine of collation/*collatio inter liberos*.

The rules will vary between jurisdictions.

If you look at the number of social/political/interest groups that have formed, gain recognition and then regressed, it is a clear pattern.\n\nIn general, it seems as if two things happen.  The move to monetize a movement or concept is a clear indication that the underlying ""cause"", is no longer a splinter or unpopular belief.  In our case, gays are mainstream, companies will profit from that---not because they support our needs---but because it means $$$.\n\nAdditionally, many of the organizations and events fade away as they have less and less value.   The good news is that we are becoming much more accepted and mainstream.  The bad news is that our ""specialness"" (even if it is in our own minds) is becoming less viable.  \n\nProgress on rights and recognition is wonderful...but there is a tradeoff.   This article and these thoughts are indications that the ""gay movement"" has achieved many great things.  But we are paying for mainstream identity with our queer identity.  For many that is a great trade off.   For some of us older queers, we morn a bit for the radicalness that came with being openly gay in a less forgiving time.']"

633,"A polite clarification - What does ""Queer"" mean?","Hey Radicals!!

I guess I'm part of the old guard and wanted to ask a question that maybe obvious to some, but isn't to me.

What is queer?

As a kid growing up, I had the feeling that it meant ""gay/homosexual,"" but after perusing /r/sexpositive, and linking over to you, i get the feeling that either the term has expanded, or I didn't understand it fully. Does it mean anything ""not straight?"" Does it have a masculine and/or feminine connotation? Is it a slang term for the whole LGBT community? Is it an umbrella term that has different nuances for different people? 

Just wanted to know how to flow with this group and don't want to offend!! 

Thanks for the clarification & helping those of us who are trying to navigate these modern waters!

I\'m married to a gender queer person, who has at times identified as a woman and at other times as a man. Does that make me bisexual? \n\nI don\'t have clear answers to these questions and I\'ve given up trying to have clear answers. I\'m done trying to reduce the complexity of my sex/gender/sexuality into simplistic categories. Thus, I embrace ""queer"" as an open-ended solution. \n\nMy sexuality defies the traditional models and so I use queer as a way of rejecting the older model and maintaining my individuality.', ""Queer in a way that rejects being defined.

My drag mother is nonbinary too, and her boyfriend is a trans man. I\'ve always looked at it as a big ""fuck you"" toward societal expectations, in a way, and then you make some fucking art out of it. My city has several trans woman queens, several trans guy kings, and I know a few trans guy queens as well. Drag was what made me realize I was trans in the first place, and then it helped me find a home. Without it, I wouldn\'t have my drag mother (who is a much better mother than my biological mom) and I probably wouldn\'t be here. It\'s part of my coping mechanism as a queer person. I\'m angry and tired and it\'s what I use to cope. I\'m happier in drag than out. I\'m more confident, more social, not as depressed. It\'s my drag mom\'s coping mechanism too, in a way. We\'re poor queers who make art to cope (and to make money because we have exactly two dollars and some warm gummy bears).It gave me a sense of community, a sense of family. It\'s that way for a lot of people, especially ones with unsupportive families. \n\nOf course, like every group, you\'ve got the ones who give others a bad name, but the vast majority of the ones I\'ve come to know are incredibly kind people. I\'ve met a few sticklers for gender binary so far, but they were both trans women (also older, coming from a time when that was just like the ONLY IMPORTANT THING) and then you\'ve got people like my drag mother who are very passionate about destroying that mentality, and that number is already much higher and growing. \n\nThe movie Paris Is Burning is good to watch because I relate to it immensely, but [this clip](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_qWaAS3olWQ) is probably the one that pins down my relationship to drag the best.

Ultimately, there isn't anything that is inherently subversive nor are there actions that reify or strengthen the gender (and sex) binary, but instead drag opens a window to the parody of gender performance and shows us that it's possible to manipulate and transform the discourses revolving around gendered and sexed bodies.\n\nSo I don't think that drag is a tool in itself to subvert gender, but it doesn't strengthen the binary either. Drag shows (not *is*) the *potential* for Queer transformations. \n\nHistorically there is a lot of really interesting feminist history revolving around drag queens and 2nd wave feminism about men coopting women's spaces (which this has largely been dismissed as transphobic/transmisogynistic as 3rd wave feminism has established itself)\n\nTangentially unrelated, I think the most fulfilling sex I've had was with a drag queen.

674,Is it possible to have an anti-heteronormative pro-queer wedding?,"Hey guys. Thought this might be the right place for this. 

I need advice. I [lesbian] am in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend of many years and I recently proposed to her. I never thought I would get married but it is important to her and making her happy is important to me. I considered it for a long time and I know this is what I want, but I have some problems with it. To say the least.  

I have always felt a strong rejection to the idea of getting married. I realize now that that rejection stems from growing up in an environment where weddings have always been a strictly heteronormative ceremony that by concept conforms to strict gender roles and expectations. I was a pretty queer kid growing up. I fought my entire life to fight against gender expectations and to come to terms with believing it was ok to disregard them. I grew up resenting heteronormativity for receiving the praise that I realized I would never receive by just being true to myself. But I accepted it. I have self worth today because I was able to see those roles as bullshit. 

Except now all of a sudden my love is legally ""equal"" and I'm supposed to just abandon that fight against heteronormativity and participate in this ceremony that has excluded me for so long and represents the exact type hierarchy I have fought so hard to reject? I feel like I have been begrudgingly handed a key to a room that I have never been granted access to before and have fought my entire life to convince myself I don't want to go and I am now supposed to just forget all that, be grateful for the key, and go in? I don't want to go in there. I like it out here. 

I have spoken to my girlfriend about this and she totally hears and understands me. She doesn't *necessarily* share the same fervor I do on the topic, but I know she will compromise on some things and make the day feel right for both of us. I love her, I want to have a party to celebrate our commitment to one another, I just want to find a way to do it without feeling like I am betraying my queerness. Is that possible? Or is participating in this institution just shameless assimilation?
",3wgnhs,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/3wgnhs/is_it_possible_to_have_an_antiheteronormative/,"['[deleted]', ""I think the idea of a legal marriage and the idea of a commitment ceremony can be distinct. The ideas many people associate with marriage traditionally, those that seem steeped in patriarchy and heteronormativity (father giving the bride away, bridesmaids/groomsmen, wearing white to symbolize purity, etc) are not things you HAVE to do. \n\nLike, if the long-term plan for commitment is there, having a legal marriage at the courthouse might save you some headaches when it comes to medical visitation rights, insurance coverage, etc. this might alleviate some of the discomfort in the idea of buying into marriage, since there are some pretty decent benefits to that piece of paper. \n\nthe ceremony itself, should you choose to have one (you don't have to!) can go in any direction you want it to"", ""Keep the cake (because everyone likes cake), the open bar (ditto), some sort of music, the idea of readings, and ditch everything else.\n \nIf you want to challenge the exclusionary binary of marriage, what about celebrating multiple forms of love? IMO, one especially troubling part of the 'fairy tale' wedding narrative has always been the idea that only one type of relationship should be lifted up and sanctified as 'true love'. We decide who we love and how we love, not a piece of paper or an officiant. Love can between family members, between friends, even between strangers. Just because these ideas do not conform to the hetero-normative definition of love as a performative act linked to physical intimacy, that doesn't make them any less meaningful as lived experiences. \n\nAnother way you could disrupt the traditional narrative of weddings would be to ask your guests to help celebrate your love by participating in an act of community service. You pick your favorite local good cause and get with them to plan the event. Instead of receiving gifts, you could subvert the materialistic tradition by instead asking people to donate to that good cause (which will pay for the supplies for your community service). After a half-day or day of building community, tell your guests that you'd like to thank them for their kindness and generosity by taking them out to eat. (Insist that no one should change clothes or you'll be late) At the restaurant, you've further subverted tradition by arriving as equals, dressed down instead of up. You can break bread together, someone can stand and make a wildly inappropriate toast (good luck getting away from that tradition), and if you so desire, bring on the radical readings. \n\nAnd then the cake. \nBecause everyone likes cake. \n"", 'Considering it is often necessary to participate in other patriarchal systems, like capitalism or obtaining services from male dominated hierarchical corporations, participating in the institution of marriage is no more selling out.

Leave ""father"" MacArthur out of it, invite all your fabulous friends, and parade around town with a convoy and a sign that says ""just lesbian married"".']"

678,"How can we as queers take control of the ""gay agenda""?","Let me get real for a second. Systems of prejudice are not arbitrary. These systems didn't just /happen/ -- they were created for specific purposes, to fulfill the military and political strategies of the People In Charge.

Let's not be naive. Marginalized peoples are dehumanized and degraded for specific reasons. Women have been degraded since the Burning Times because the natural power of women (the holders of life and natural keepers of the Old Religion) was a threat to the rise of patriarchal civilization based on oppression and violence, and women are still degraded because the feminine continues to threaten the dominance of this uber-fragile neo-masculinity required to sustain a violent and oppressive culture. The fabricated idea of whiteness created racism to justify Western Civ's violent expansion into and exploitation of lands populated by people of differing skin tones, as well as the continuing exploitation of people of color. So why are queers among the list of oppressed peoples?

Before the rise of patriarchal civilization, queers were the political, spiritual, and medicinal adepts of pretty much all ""uncivilized"" nature societies. We quite literally hold the balance between male and female energies. We have mediated these forces since the dawn of time. In a world increasingly focused on ""black vs white"" ""women vs men"" ""gay vs straight"" ""trans vs cis"" ""Christian vs ...everything else"" ""Democrat vs Republican"" ""western power vs eastern power"" ""privileged vs unprivileged"" ""civilized vs wild"", we need these natural mediators more than ever.

Queers have an indispensable quality unlike any other group of people -- we transcend boundaries and categories. We exist in every culture, every skin tone, every religion, every nation, and every family. We cannot be exterminated by genocide. We are not bound by blood but liberated by spirit. We have always existed to hold the balance of the natural forces in this world. We are the gatekeepers between this life and the next. When our power is respected, there can be peace rather than conflict. Mediation leads to understanding, not war.

Queer people are not a novelty. Queerness is not about sex anymore than life itself is about sex. The liberation of queer people stands for bringing balance and peace back to a world that's been knocked /way/ out of whack. This isn't about marriage. This isn't about monogamous love. This isn't about the nuclear family.

Queers are literally killed by their own families and communities in many parts of the world today. Many first world queers are allowing themselves to be distracted by recent efforts for greater ease of assimilation. We as queers have a purpose and responsibility to represent a world family not tied by culture, blood, appearance, or ideology. We are uniquely qualified to represent humanity as a whole -- to bridge categories and divisions -- to mediate between groups -- to solve conflict and reclaim peace -- to hold the balance.

We as humans need a radical shift in the way queers are represented, perceived, and treated. We are not the source of evil in this world (violence and oppression [read: evil] have run rampant far more with the rise of Christianity and other anti-queer ideologies than before); we are the source of balance. How can we as queers tap into our natural abilities to bring peace to a world in desperate need of balance? How can we represent ourselves in a way that truly conveys our timeless message -- rather than the assimilationist goals of the modern gay rights movement? How can we tap into our power in order to be better perceived by the world as a transcendent people with the unique capability to unite humanity?",3tzs0g,18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalqueers/comments/3tzs0g/how_can_we_as_queers_take_control_of_the_gay/,"[""I don't think queers have any particular super powers or represent anything so grand intrinsically.  Mysticism around queer people in the cultures you are talking about are not exactly evidence of actual transcendence and certainly not even the perception of it outside of those cultures.  By identifying as queer rather than gay or bi alone we can combat dichotomous modes of thought.  As an oppressed people, I say we focus on oppression and hierarchy as being illegitimate.  By accepting spectrum's rather than tribes there can be a lot of progress made in creating solidarity, but human nature is to be tribal, and no matter how much progress that can be made in ending tribalism in gender and orientation, I do not think even the power of queerness can end all tribalism and create universal solidarity alone.  It certainly is a step.  I think that is the best way to view ourselves as a group, a step in the right direction, but still just a part of the larger movement toward social revolution."", 'I history lesson for the ignorant colonial imperialist settlers would be a start.

681,"Trans woman, anarchist prison rebel needs support!","Hey y'all,
Jennifer Gann is a resolved anarchist trans woman prison rebel who would benefit greatly from a more established and broad support system. So, we've created three internet things for her: A support site on noblogs.org, a fundraiser on youcaring.com, and a list on Riseup. We've done this in the hopes that other people may be interested in playing an active role in her support and be interested in interfacing with people aren't so anti-social as me and/or us.
Right now there are three major goals which Jennifer has:

#1: Jennifer is doing life under the rein of california's three strikes law. However, under California‚Äôs Proposition 36 ‚ÄúThree Strikers Reform Act of 2012‚Äù the court is required to re-sentence her as second striker and give her a sentence of 20 years or less, which could lead to her release from prison. So, right now she has access to a lawyer who specializes in prop 36 cases whose willing to defend her for $4,000, hence the fundraiser. We're hoping to use this fundraiser as a vessel for getting more people involved in her case and to establish for her a broad support crew.

#2: To get the court to pay for her sex reassignment surgery. Legal precedent has just been set for this in the cases of Michelle-Lael Norsworthy and Shiloh Quine.

#3: To get transferred to a women's prison

So, these things all require allot of lawmen and the dollars they so diligently demand. Not only this, but they likely involve allot of emotional ups and downs in the ensuing struggles. Please, consider supporting this wonderful rebel who spent ten years of her life in solitary confinement and in unashamed about her vengeful attack on an associate warden and the District Attorney during a prison riot!

For more information about who Jennifer is, the multi-city fundraiser we're hoping to organize, and a current mailing address go to:

A local theatre company in Brisbane (Australia) is putting together a show about peoples' experiences living in a society dominated by gender and sexual binaries, and it's going to be primarily composed of stories that have been sent to them. We're doing a short, confidential, online vox-pop through google forms asking for either a short story about your life or for a letter you never wrote. It takes less than five minutes and contributes to pro-feminist exposure. This process is open to everyone and anyone of any gender or sexuality, indeed the more the merrier.


*Full Disclosure: If you flick through my reddit account, you'll see I am a cissexual white middle-class male. While I did the programming I am not involved in the writing in any way and do not read the responses. I assure you that these submissions are confidential and will go towards creating a pro-feminist, sex-positive piece by queer authors in a major local festival.*

708,Ranting for the sake of it,"I feel like gender is way more complicated than people give it credit for, and I don't get the whole [genderbreadperson-tendency](http://sjwiki.org/wiki/Genderbread_person) to try to find _the perfect formula_ of different ""categories"" within which you can have gender, and I'm getting so tired of the people whose main political deed at this point is expanding the different titles and tags you can have.

Like, the [social-democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Social_Democratic_Youth_League) at school keeps repeating a mantra of ""four types of gender; biological sex, legal gender, psychological gender, social gender"" essentially by instinct every time gender is broached, as if there's any inherent truth to those categorizations. It feels like some sort of word-game of figuring out where on these matrices to pinpoint you _individual gender identity!^tm_

I mean, you could probably call me ""fluid"" or whatever because it says M on my passport and I sometimes I like playing with ""female"" gender expression and feel a bit tingly when people call me ""she"". Or I could be cis, because I'm most used to ""he"" and don't call me a non-man neccessarily and stuff. It just feels like a bit of mental gymnastics I don't wanna participate in...

Really, I feel pretty content just resigning to critiquing gender on a structural and group-basis, as well as seeing how gender plays into interactions between me and other _individuals._ Because, as it is and my gendered place societaly, I _generally_ am placed in some sort of default position of power towards non-men (etc), and having grown up in a gendered environment I've been socialised to take more place than many in groups, something I have to be aware of.

I know Vihart said stuff that felt familiar, and Genderkills wrote that gender nihilist manifesto, but I really feel lost otherwise as to this kind of thing, with most ""gender-critical"" stuff being centered around expanding the quantity of categories etc etc..

But short of that, it was entirely her choice to go there. At any time she could have relented and elected to actually so her job."", ""I think it's important to note that jails and prisons are not the same thing. She wasn't in a prison and she's not going to go to one. "", ""I do have to point out that she is not being required to sign marriage licences; merely to refrain from interfering with her deputies who are willing to comply with the law.\n\nWhile I agree that imprisonment is unjust generally, she's a state actor, (not) performing a state function. Why would she not be subject to the punishment of the state? Live by the sword, die by the sword."", 'A while ago, I spent two days locked up in a locked psychiatric ward because I was (falsely, at the time) suspected of being suicidal. It\'s not like I was a big fan of prisons before that, but this experience drastically showed me how horrible it is to be imprisoned, regardless of the circumstances. To look out of a barred window and know, ""I cannot go there."" This contributed to me becoming very critical of imprisonment as a punishment, and seeing it as, basically, a form of psychological torture. I think it can at best be a necessary evil, and we should always think long and hard about when it\'s really necessary. \n\nSo, it gave me no joy to hear she\'s in jail. I don\'t wish it on her. What I wish is for her to, if she cannot accept same-sex marriage, to at least tolerate it by letting her employees do it. \n\nI also think there are cases where you should follow your conscience instead of the law. Sometimes, laws are wrong. Such as when homosexuality was illegal. I sometimes put my own opinion above the law: for example, when jaywalking at an empty road, or smoking pot. However, those things really don\'t harm anybody else. I think breaking a law in a way that affects other people is a different thing.\nDoubly so if you are indeed a representative of the state yourself. She is not a victim of government overreach, she is a perpetrator in it. \n\nShe signed up voluntarily for a job where she has authority over others as part of a hierarchy. I think it is fair to expect from her that thus she also has to accept the authority of those above her in it. This is entirely elective; she can stop being part of that hierarchy at any time she wishes. I think she is therefore getting a lot more leniency than others who break the law. If somebody gets caught with drugs, they might be put in prison for a certain specified duration. It would not matter if they promise to not do it again. She, however, could always say that she\'s either going to follow the law or resign so that she doesn\'t have to follow it anymore. Most imprisoned people do not have this luxury.\n\n\nIt is such a difficult case because it\'s unclear what else to do. I think the judge recognized correctly that if he fined her, all her bigoted supporters would simply pay her fines, and it would have no effect at all. So what should be done? She has to be stopped somehow, or others will suffer for her bigotry.\n\nI think the best solution may be if there was a shortcut for the impeachment process in such a case. Get her out of that job that she is clearly unfit to perform. \n\nBut yeah; my Schadenfreude is very limited by my thoughts on imprisonment, and I would like to see a better solution. I am just not sure how.', "">  Whether or not her beliefs allowed her the right to deny marriage licenses is still a matter of debate.  \n  \nWhy do they say this? It's not a matter of debate.

There is also a section about the military and prisons. \n\nMarriage is assimilation for a number of reasons. For me, the argument is that marriage shouldn't be an institution in the first place. Everybody should have access to the benefits that marriage provides, without being married. By restricting these benefits to marriage, we are hurting the most disadvantaged among us. \n\nMarriage also promotes the nuclear family as the end all be all, ignoring the fact that many of us are polyamorous. \n\nMarriage is also mostly important to rich, white LGBT people. There are much more pressing needs, such as violence against trans women, HIV treatment, and homelessness among LGBT youth. Now that the LGBT people with money have their marriage, they will likely stop their efforts towards equality, because it doesn't affect them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's good that gay marriage was legalized. If we have to have marriage at all, it's better that we can all do it. But it is not a real step towards equality. It is equality for privileged LGBT, but not for the people that actually need the help. Hopefully the mainstream gay rights movement will move on to something more useful, but I very much doubt it will.  It is assimilation because those privileged LGBT will now leave everyone else behind, because they have equality in their suburbs.\n\nCheck out the book from Against Equality (the site I linked) if you are interested.

743,"Dancing with a smile worn, not felt","I posted this to Facebook over the weekend, so it's written for a broader audience.  I wanted to share it here too, though, since I mostly only lurk here.  I've been trying to understand how to orient my feelings around marriage equality without putting down queer people that feel so happy about it, but also while expressing my own discomfort and sadness that I've been feeling.

The world is beautiful and this is a great step for those people that will marry because of it. My heart sings for them.

I've been having conversations with queer people that I love and admire, and I think that many of our thoughts and feelings regarding marriage equality are lost beneath the roar of celebration, much of which comes from straight allies (who I do fully appreciate). I'm posting some of my thoughts here because otherwise many of these thoughts would never leave queer circles.

The SCOTUS decision brings public recognition for versions of love that look somewhat like mine, but it also creates a pressure on me to love and connect in a certain way. It doesn't celebrate the person that I am. It is a victory for many people in my community, who love in a way that required a fight for recognition. I am so happy that they finally have that.

I am thinking about the number of straight couples making out at San Francisco pride and how they outnumbered the amount of queer couples. I am still saddened by the invisible barriers that keep us from finding certain types of love. I am feeling like I'm somehow still the boy that shook and tensed up and heartfluttered and laughed when he first held the hand of another boy in the night streets of Denver and how I can look at the person that I am now and see hope and pride. I have dissolved so many of these barriers that exist within my own body, and am taking the time to appreciate the amount of work that it took. I look at the queer people around me and see them putting in extensive work to accept themselves in ways that no straight person will ever be aware of. This is a strong and impressive community.

I am also thinking about instincts that so many men I've dated share, like the instinct to not kiss in public, and to look around first before holding hands. I'm supposed to get married in this body? Will he check the crowd before our first kiss as a married couple, just to feel safe?

I won't be getting married, today or ever in the future. It is not an institution that I would ever feel comfortable benefitting from or contributing to.

And still my heart sings along with Andrea Gibson at the beginning of their poem I Do: I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do I do I do I do I do I do I do... But the fuckers say we can't.
Still the fuckers say we can't. They say that my sex is gross, that the way I move my hips is effeminate, that I am weaker for the strength of my love, that a marriage should be celebrated but that the world would still be better if everyone were straight, that sucking a dick is a thing to be ashamed of.

748,One of my comments in /r/Anarchism regarding Marriage,"**DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE RELATE GAY MARRIAGE TO THE 8 HOUR WORK DAY**


Beginning in the riots following Stonewall up through early 2000's after the closing of ACT UP! there has been a steady liberalization and commodification of the ""LGBTQ"" rights movement -- with Marriage being the pinnacle of this movement.


Stonewall was once home to the faggots, queers, and indentity-fucks that were the outcasts of the Gay community; now it's a white-washed tourist attraction where the radical trannies and Queers that once fought the police have been sanitized and silenced. Castro street was once the safe space for the poor, not-white, queers. Now it's the epitome of a white-washed, neoliberal, hetero-apologist community that has crushed the minority queers under the elitist consumerism of gentrification.
If you know anything at all about queer history then you understand the fight for marriage came about in the early 2000's after ACT UP! was functionally disbanded to replaced by FUCKING LOBBYIST GROUPS like Human Rights Campaign. It's the lobbyist groups that have fought for marriage. Actual radical queer groups from the very beginning starting with the Mattachine Society toGay Liberation Front and up through ACT UP! have been about survival and creating safe spaces -- Not assimilation into social hierarchies.
To think that the fight for marriage is any reflection on the historical roots of the LGBTQ movement is an extreme bastardization and a liberal revisionist views.


Further, nearly EVERY historical Anarchist opposes marriage because of the intrinsic power that it grants to the government.


Celebrating the assimilation into marriage is like celebrating the strike down of Don't Ask Don't Tell and the legal assimilation into the military. Neither are a reflection of what Queer rights have been about, and both are prime examples of liberal co-option to assimilate more bodies into the tendrils of the state.

So a radical queer could be anyone who reclaims the latter term and has anarchist or marxist politics\n\n* or it might be applied to someone who takes a radical approach to political issues relevant to \'the queer subject\'. what does this mean? a principle of radical queer politics is refusing the isolation of LGBTetc issues- slogans like \'poverty is a queer issue\' because it\'s something we\'re more likely to have to deal w due to our oppression, \'racism is a queer issue\' because it influences which of us face the brunt of our oppression; rejecting the full integration of LGBT persons into imperialist militaries or the capitalist economy as a liberatory goal (even doubting the possibility of the latter); rejecting narratives that use the presence of (hard-won) legal rights to justify racism, war, and occupation; rejecting liberal understandings of oppression, and looking at how homophobia and transphobia are tied into other kinds of oppression...ultimately, i think it would be fair to say that it\'s about not being content with inclusion in a fundamentally unjust order (a false promise to begin with for many), and seeking to practice solidarity with others for whom present conditions are intolerable.\n\nNeedless to say there\'s overlap.

802,The Bottom Whore Manifesto,"*By Anonymous*

  


It‚Äôs the twenty-first century but our history is still one of oppression. As part of the LGBTQ community, we are each day a step closer to winning the battle against heteronormativity. However, inside their very own movement, monsters of subjugation lurk and bite. Not every gay man is equal inside the community. Surprisingly enough, the gays produce and reproduce structures of oppression and power structures inside our faction. In the lower echelons of the gay hierarchy, you can find us: the bottom whores.


  


**THE IDENTITY**



Before rallying together for insurgence, let‚Äôs answer the question: who are we? We are homosexual cis men who are very sexually promiscuous and prefer to receive penetration during anal sex. Beyond the gay identity, we are actually the intersection of two different groups: The Whores and The Bottoms.


***I.A The Whores***


We dwell in the same spectrum of every sexually promiscuous person. That is to say that we pertain to The Whores, which include individuals from many different groups such as lascivious lesbians, licentious heterosexuals, bed-hopping tops, slutty transgender people, latino bitches, etc. We are all lambasted by our practices and lifestyles. Recognize us. Learn our characteristics as whores:


*Sex is purely physical for us. Our sexual encounters are devoid of emotional attachment of any sort. The essential purpose of sex is sensible pleasure. In other words, if we have sex with you, it doesn‚Äôt mean we love you, appreciate you, care for you or even like you as a person. 


*Sexual encounters are multiple throughout our lives. Our encounters can be planned or completely random. We can recur the same group of people a few times or have one-time-things. However, we use protection (condoms) and take precautions to prevent the contagion of sexually transmitted diseases.


*Most of us will never get formally married. We might have emotional partners from time to time but the institution of marriage is completely meaningless for us and even evil.


*We are open about our sexuality. Copulation is not a private/personal matter. If we fuck someone, we will talk about it.





*We are all characterized as ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù by the mainstream society. We are called names in the streets and treated like a plague. We‚Äôve had enough.


***I.B The Bottoms***


The only thing that defines us as Bottoms is that we prefer to be penetrated during anal sex. Our existence as Bottoms is negative: We only exist in their relation to Tops in anal sex. There is nothing inherently common among us beside that. In a way, the only thing that keeps us together is that we have been forced into the same label. However, we all suffer from many strong stereotypes and roles ascribed to us as Bottoms that affect the way we interact and socialize in public. We are fed up. Waiting is a mistake. Let‚Äôs unite to oust the Tops and end the oppression.



**THE OPPRESSION**


We have two main enemies inside the LGBTQ community: The Conservative Gays and the Masculine Tops.


***II.A The Conservative Gays***


The Conservative gays reject our practices as Whores. Instead of a total sexual liberation, Gay Conservatism attempts to extend the oppressive patriarchal system and institution to all of us. For instance, they force marriage (an institutionalized form of slavery created to oppress women) into the gay community. That‚Äôs the reason why they are chiefly the advocates for marriage equality.


To integrate themselves into mainstream society, the Conservative gays want all queer community to mirror the heterosexual patriarchal lifestyle, accept their values, emulate their roles, work in their capitalist system, imitate their power structures in gay relationships, and be ultimately unnoticed. We, the Whores, defy the Conservative gays by denying the heterosexual patriarchal values such as monogamy, chastity before marriage, marriage, discretion, sexual privacy, and sexual intercourse as more than physical pleasure (expression of ‚Äútrue love‚Äù). Therefore, we are a threat for Gay Conservatism.


The Conservative gay try to be on top of the ‚Äúgay hierarchy‚Äù by alienating themselves from us. Just take a look at their discriminatory discourse against our whorish-ways: ‚ÄúNot all gay guys are promiscuous. We want a stable family like straight people‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe are no different from heterosexual. The only different is that our long-life partner is of the same sex‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe want kids and a big wedding too. We are not prostitutes or anything.‚Äù, ‚ÄúHooking-up is not good. Monogamy is the right way.‚Äù  , ‚ÄúSlutty gays make the whole gay community look bad.‚Äù Just shut up, Conservative gays. We are tired of depicted as the ‚Äúscum‚Äù of the gay community. We will shut you up.


Rape and  acts of violence against us are dismissed: ‚ÄúIf they are having sex with every body, that‚Äôs what they were looking for.‚Äù If a whore gets HIV or any other sexually transmitted disease, he is ostracized and frowned upon. Gay apps, online hooking up, cruising is seen as despicable and contemptible. Most gay spokesmen and gay successful people belong in some way to gay Conservatism. We want to see on TV a whore who is also famous, successful and serious. We won‚Äôt be ridiculed anymore on sitcoms as unethical and frivolous. We are as human and serious as the President of the United States. (even more)


Since Conservative gays are widespread in media and have more economical resources, we are exposed to discrimination against us in a daily basis to the point we begin feel ashamed of being sexually promiscuous. Whores are asked to keep their sexual lives private and disappear  (almost hide) from public light. They are treated as ‚Äúuntouchables‚Äù and it‚Äôs hard for them to attained a high position in a company and/or politics. But now we will rise. Embrace yourself.


***II.B The Masculine Tops***


There has been a trend in the gay community to see us, bottoms, as inferior to the tops. Homosexual men try to identify themselves as far as they can from being a bottom. For instance, versatile gays try to use the label versatile-top, alienated men who exclusively bottom attempt to identify themselves as versatile-bottom, and tops are offended when someone identify them as bottom or even versatile.
 

However, it is fundamental to remember that these are just labels. No one is really a bottom, a versatile nor a top. The sexual preference in anal sex shouldn‚Äôt be determinant of identity in the gay community. The labels were created to sustain a hierarchy in which the tops would be above versatiles and bottoms. This is our answer for you, Masculine Tops: **Fuck you.**


Another important thing is that masculinity is attributed to tops and femininity us, bottoms. In the gay hierarchy, masculinity is considered superior, attractive, and even celebrated. Therefore, the feminine bottoms are repudiated in the masculine top discourse: ‚ÄúI am not a fag, I don‚Äôt take it in the ass‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am a total top. Not a cum-dumpster‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo fems nor faggots, please.‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am not a gay bitch. I don‚Äôt go to gay clubs nor gay pride.‚Äù.... Bitch, we are all equally gay. Stop denigrating us, masculine top. Stop.


We are expected to be submissive and adopt a woman-like role in relationships. Likewise, if a gay guy is flamboyant, he is expected to be a bottom. As a result of this, we have been limited to either: a) deny their preference to bottom and attempt to become tops (both sexually and socially) or b) try to fulfill ‚Äúthe bottom stereotype‚Äù in order to fit in. This kind of oppression restricts bottoms‚Äô authenticity and freedom of expression. We won‚Äôt will not serve anymore. If the masculine top is uncomfortable with us, GOOD. We don‚Äôt care.


**THE ALLIES**


In order to change the oppression inside the LGBTQ movement, we must ally with other queer identities (other than the Whores and The Bottoms) that have been forced to lower echelons of the gay hierarchy. These other identities include: Transsexuals, Queer people of Color, Proletarian Queers, Polygamy supporters. Our struggles might be different but we share common enemies!


**THE SHAKEDOWN**



The Bottom whores will not take this oppression anymore. We won‚Äôt be ashamed of ourselves nor try to hide their sexual practices. We are fed up with the power structures that pervade the gay community. The LGBT community must accept all the identities equally and destroy any kind of oppression inside the movement. We want a true Sexual Revolution.

As a group, we demand:

*Equal treatment for lascivious, monogamous and polygamous queer people. Stop the slut shaming.




*Disconnection from the anal sex role and the other aspects of one‚Äôs life.





*Equal treatment of masculinity and femininity.





*Free sexual expression. No boundaries.

In order to achieve this, We must:


*Make themselves visible. Stop hiding or forging an identity. Strive for authenticity.




*Have zero tolerance with intolerance. We have been playing this game for too long. There is no time to tolerate the oppressor.



Although the LGBTQ movement as a whole has progressed in the last few years, there is still considerable amount of oppression and discrimination inside the community. Listen to us, gay world. Let us, the bottom whores, be loud and clear when we say: The gay community will be all-accepting and free, or it simply will nevermore be!

816,2 Studies That Prove Domestic Violence Is an LGBT Issue,,331pok,3,0,http://www.advocate.com/crime/2014/09/04/2-studies-prove-domestic-violence-lgbt-issue,[]
817,"On why bisexuals neither seek heterosexual privilege, nor have heterosexual privilege while in an opposite-gender relationship",,331mvq,3,10,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amy-andre/heterosexual-privilege-and-bisexual-hearts_b_2113470.html,"['""Heterosexual privilege"" is misleading because it implies that the only reason man-woman relationships are treated differently is because of a perception that the individuals in auch relationships are heterosexual. While such assumptions do exist in some cases, and it is true that it is often better (with regards to how others treat you) to be perceived as heterosexual, there are 3 problems with this concept. The first is, of course, that this perception does not always exist: that if one is known to be bisexual, then even in a man-woman relationship, they are not immune from homophobia and biphobia being directed at them (which can lead to bi women facing additional violence compared to heterosexual women, as noted in the article). And even if they have not disclosed (or been outed), they still see all the attacks on their same-gender desire that heterosexual people never do. The last reason, to go back to what I started off with: society isn\'t fundamrntally organized regarding these things on the basis of sexual orientation (a fairly recent concept)- certain relationships are viewed as superior not because they signal heterosexuality...this gets it backwards: the demand for heterosexuality is about getting people into such relationships.\n\nThe second paragraph neglects the pressure of heterosexist society. Bi people are pressured into man-woman relationships- and, yes, so are LG people (although, for the latter, such relationships are necessarily lacking, which isn\'t the case for bi people such as myself)! Ignoring this doesn\'t help *any* LGB people. It\'s also strange to see an article posted to *radicalqueers* acting as if subjectivity is formed in a vacuum isolated from society. We are then told that privilege is about saying mean things- not, I don\'t know, structural relationships between exploited and oppressed (mean words are involved, certainly, but without society being organized so that A\'s words have a deletorious impact on people in B group, but not the other way around...then privilege doesn\'t have anything to do with it, even if it\'s not nice).\n\nAgain, it doesn\'t help bisexuals to pretend that we aren\'t pressured to \'make the right choice\' with the promise of better treatment (that is, of escaping the threat of being treated as those in same-gender relationships are).\n\n""Monosexual"" (especially with ""privilege"" attached, but even without) is a word that is useless to fighting heterosexism, because it doesn\'t correspond to how society is organized (whether one is looking at the oppression of bisexual people or that of lesbian and gay people).', '>if bisexuals really experience ""heterosexual privilege"" when they are in different-sex relationships, why are the rates of domestic violence victimization so much higher for bisexuals, in particular bisexual women in relationships with men, compared with women of other sexual orientations?\n\nThis article is treating privilege and sexuality like it is an ""all or nothing"" phenomenon and it makes some troubling statements as a result. \n\nWe can clearly identify struggles that people identifying as bisexuals face, and the article does a good job of that, but this doesn\'t negate potential gains/privilege from presenting as straight.\n\nPrivilege isn\'t something you either have or don\'t in a singular moment depending on how you identify or what sort of label you put on your sexual/intimate relationships. Privilege is a concept we use to describe the aggregation of benefits gained, actions taken, thoughts had, et cetera in relation to a particular social structure/identity.\n\nA bisexual who is presently in a hetero relationship may well experience negative effects because of their sexual identity. That doesn\'t mean that the person hasn\'t or doesn\'t gain from hetero-normative structures. A person can both gain relative to others and lose relative to others due to hetero-normativity. For example: a bisexual identifying person in a heterosexual relationship is much less likely to be randomly assaulted for their sexuality when walking down the street with their partner when compared to a bisexual in a homosexual relationship.\n\nThe article links to another article by the same author that is talking about another study:\n\n>what we have here is a situation in which people who not straight, and who are in relationships with men, are being abused by those men. The study, then, is not so much about the experiences of bisexual women or gay men but about those of queer people who date men.\n\nSo we can also say the problem is queer people dating men or the clash between a toxic hetero-normative masculinity and a queer sexuality; I think attributing this difference to bisexuality, though it is not technically wrong, misses what the problem is. Identifying as a bisexual does not automatically rid a person of internalized hetero-normativity or remove all gains from hetero-normativity. The article does make a good point that I think explains more what is going on here:\n\n>the fact is that many socially conscious people, including many members of the LGBT community, are actually more likely to do things like examine privilege, disavow it, work to dismantle it or resist it.\n\nMaybe a person who is more likely to *identify as bisexual* (not have ""bisexual urges"" or whatever) is also more likely to have a more critical view of hetero-normative behaviors because of their placement in a specific community or some cultural phenomenon. I don\'t think the identity isn\'t necessarily key, it is another symptom of a healthier discourse on sexuality.\n\nBut the author furthers their critique with:\n\n> It implies that same-sex love is influenced and regulated -- in some hearts -- by social norms.\n\nThe author then goes on to argue that the statement above is queerphobic. If we stopped there it would be but I think that is just how all love works. I don\'t think it is wise to ignore how social norms build the world around us or how those norms impact our behavior and decisions; if hetero-normativity didn\'t restrict or impact our intimate decisions, our lives, in a way we see as negative it wouldn\'t be hetero-normativity anymore. Everyone might have sexual attractions to certain types of people built into them, I don\'t know, but regardless of this fact our behaviors, our sexualities, all of our identities and our experiences of them are mediated through our horrible social structures. It might not control them entirely but it is always an influence, our sexuality doesn\'t exist in a vacuum regardless of whether or not the sexual preferences are innate.\n\nClearly the statement that the article is arguing against is ridiculous but we don\'t need to fetishize bisexual identity in order to rebuke it and I don\'t think doing so helps any of us. Bisexuality is another way of describing sexual preference, a person with that preference and/or that identity may experience negative effects at the hands of hetero-normative actions/structures but it doesn\'t mean they are immune from hetero-normative gains.']"

I am not trying to condemn the article or the people writing it and I want that to be clear, but I do think there is a valid critique to be had. This article illustrates a concerted effort to portray bisexuality as a coherent and static identity category, another sexuality. At this point I feel I have to say that I find bisexuality is no more or less an innate quality than any other sexual identity; but I\'m not sure that trying to liberate bisexuals or bisexuality is all it is claimed to be.\n\nAmongst this movement there is certainly good that is done, but why do we allow our politics to be restricted by heterosexist legitimizing? What I mean is that a politics that is to provide room for the individual to realize their desires rather than trying to legitimize bisexuality, a discourse which renders our politics in a de facto state of condemning any sexual way of being that cannot be identified as gay, straight, or now maybe bisexual.\n\nOnce again I am not saying this is stopping good from being done within the push for recognition of bisexuality, I am not trying to invalidate that, but this problem pervades.\n\nWe need to stop playing into a politics that begins with the assumption that a person needs to legitimize their sexual activities as ""natural"" or ""innate"" or as ""just like straight people"" in order to be treated as having valid will. We need to stop saying ""we deserve to be treated like people because our identity is as valid as yours"" and just stop after the first 6 words. We deserve to be treated like people regardless of whether or not we can garner enough political support for our preferred identity category and, consequently, legitimize our being.\n\nWe are playing in a sexual politics that robs everyone of the claim to a legitimacy of their desires, unless the person can keep their sexuality within the confines of a restrictive, normative sexual category. \n\nSome might not have desires that can be adequately described as hetero, homo or bisexual, I don\'t feel we should have to keep our actions within the accepted limits of any of these identities in order to be considered valid.\n\nI\'m not claiming the article or their discourse is to blame for this erasure, that would be silly; I just thought this might be a good place to talk about why we require identity for validity. This default disrespect for a person is a political trick as a result of institutionalized heterosexist sexuality and it is really a load of crap.\n\nIn this situation we aren\'t trying to get marriage, we aren\'t really trying to get legal rights; maybe empowering an identity category is the wrong way to go. We need to look at a problem that is often obscured by identity politics; the bad treatment of specific identity groups is clearly a significant problem, but it is not the only problem. It is not a problem that can be entirely fixed through these sort of identity-based liberation methods. \n\nOur problem is our society is founded upon sick ideas of what it means to be a person, about who deserves to be treated well, that you must act in a prescribed manner in order to gain the status of a real person, et cetera. Within this politics you must have a sexuality that is socially accepted as valid otherwise you can be treated as less than human. We will never fix our problems if all we do is create a more complex schema of categorization. ']"

I had a definite feeling that I was not a ""real boy"", that I didn\'t really want to be one, and that I could never be a ""real man"", and any sort of sexism or machismo annoyed me greatly. But I did not consider myself a girl, and genderqueer wasn\'t really an option for a child in the 80s/90s, so I was mostly fine being a not-quite-real-boy.\n\n\nHowever, gender aside, I suffered from severe social phobia and depression, and was incredibly afraid of school. The reason I mention that is that I think what I encountered there was an attitude that affects trans* children a lot: The attitude that adults always know what\'s best for a child, *even if the child right in front of them is clearly suffering due to their decisions*. I\'m not quite a proponent of totally anti-authoritarian parenting, I think in some regards parents and teachers sometimes *do* have a better grasp of the situation than children, simply due to more life experience. \n\nBut that should never extend to a child\'s inner feelings. No matter how much older you are, or how much more experienced, you can\'t tell another human being, child or adult, what to *feel*. You can\'t force a child to not be depressed, and you can\'t force a child to change their gender identity. In cases like those, adults simply *don\'t* know best, because it\'s an experience entirely internal to the child. As far as their own mental state is concerned, children are absolutely *more* qualified to make an accurate assessment than anybody else. Parents and teachers and even doctors can\'t just look into their brain and tell them, ""oh, but this is what you *really* feel!"" (And if they could, as some experiments with trans people show, they would probably find that the facts support the subjective experience of the child, rather than the externally applied social norms). \n\n\nWhen children talk about their own thoughts and feelings, their own state of mind, *they are the leading expert*. What they say should be taken seriously, and not disregarded simply due to their age. ']"
