In reality, extreme destitution is a sign of severe social and economic distress arising during periods of upheaval and dislocation. The evidence reviewed suggests that poverty alleviation and gains in human health have historically been linked to socialist political movements and public action, not to capitalism. The expansion of the capitalist world-system caused a dramatic and prolonged process of impoverishment on a scale unparalleled in recorded history, and recovery from this prolonged condition of crisis occurred only recently. The rise of capitalism caused a decline in nutritional standards and health outcomes. The evidence suggests that human communities are innately capable of producing enough to meet their basic needs, and extreme poverty only arises when people are cut off from land and commons or when their labour and resources are appropriated by a ruling class or an external imperial power. Poverty may result from any system where an underclass lacks political and economic power.']"

Police didn't immediately say if anyone was in custody in connection with the shooting.Surveillance video shows someone walking into Dollar Tree on North Montello Street Tuesday afternoon. Moments later, several people can be seen running out of the store.After less than a minute, the person who had walked in can be seen leaving the store and taking off.Lisa Dower lives right across the street and came outside when she heard multiple police cars arriving. She saw one of the victims, who had managed to make it to the street.""The gentleman was lying on the sidewalk,"" she said. ""At first, he wasn't moving. I was scared for him, and then I saw his arms moving.""He was rushed to the hospital.""When they put him on the gurney, I noticed blood around part of his leg,"" said Dower.A bullet hole could be seen in a front window.Investigators haven't said if the victims were shoppers or employees. Nearby residents who shop at the Dollar Tree often spoke highly of the workers.""They're very helpful,"" said Alexander Williams. ""They go out of their way, they're not aggravating, they're not impatient, they're doing their job, trying to make it like the rest of us out here.""A spokesperson for Dollar Tree released a brief statement Tuesday night.""We are aware of the tragic incident at our store in Brockton, MA (N. Montello St. location) this afternoon and are actively assisting law enforcement with their investigation. Our hearts go out to the victims of this horrible crime.""The part of the city where the shooting occurred is a busy area with multiple other businesses, including an Advance Auto Parts next door and a Stop & Shop grocery store located across the street.

 Strive, strive, surmount the obstacles.  
Become the essence of your goals, hereditary dream  
Pray that you may attain that destiny  
Fall into the coveted line  
Where life is but a theme of pretense in lustrous guise  


Claims and values, charts of means and status  
Plaques to show your strife  
Do your neighbor clones approve?  
Picture perfect illustration, imitation of life  
Where the path is evened out, all obstructions removed  


Great, viable citizen  
Are you happy now?  
Then praise your god and bow  


Shimmering surface  
The gleam of blinding lies  
Become the product  
The thing you so desire  


To what length would you go to reach your goals?  
What mantra will you use to justify your means?  
Who will you betray to secure your dream?  
What sins will you commit to avoid your sins to be seen?  


Do not look down  
Do not look down  
Or the abysmal beast of nonconformity might  
Stare some unpleasant truth into your desensitized mind  


Shimmering surface  
The gleam of blinding lies  
Become the product

That neither the Republicans, nor the Democrats, actually give a single fuck about the working civilians, only with the desire to seek billionaire lobby to suit corporate interests instead.\n\nBoth parties struck down the rail strike. Both sides claim to care about the working class, but again and again, continually vote in favor of the largest corporations, quietly passing laws stripping away the rights of the 99% from within the workplace. This tragedy could‚Äôve been prevented if these safety regulations were enforced, if guarantees towards the workers were enforced, and if the rail workers were allowed to strike and unionize. Instead, both parties near unanimously sided with the corporate rail giants, abandoning the rail workers who only wanted a few more sick days and better safety regulations *at the very least*, and yet neither party could‚Äôve been bothered to side with those people over profit and corporate lobby money.\n\nNeither party cares about us. It‚Äôs simple as that.\n\nAs more and more people wake up from worshipping one of the two parties and realize both are nearly just as corporate sellouts of the other, there‚Äôs the realization that *not a single* mainstream political party cares about the worker‚Äôs interests, only collecting money in college as a result. Many people are left hopeless as a result, acknowledging that neither care about our interests, but not looking for any solutions and instead continuing to vote Democrat with hopes of somehow pushing them further left. That has been tried throughout history and has not worked. So, we‚Äôre only left with one realistic option: socialism.\n\nThe government has always lied to you about socialism. That was always their intention, to mislead the public into being against a system that benefits the people and holds the bourgeoisie accountable for their actions. It‚Äôs why people only have the same 7 or so arguments against socialism engraved into their minds, all of which are relatively easy to debunk, but they are knowingly learned into our subconscious throughout our lives by usage of education and media, so less and less people will look for an alternative to a system that is destroying the planet and stripping away the rights workers have spent centuries fighting for. \n\nCorporations and the ruling class have fought tooth and nail against ordinary people being conscious of their actions, and have misled people for over a century by feeding them lies about socialism, how it never works and such, or giving the general public false information about what socialism is. In case your wondering, no, socialism isn‚Äôt just when the government does stuff, nor is it when the government owns everything, even your toothbrush. Socialism is when the workers rise into power and take over the means of production, establishing both a democratic government (ran directly by workers councils and the masses instead of corporate lobbyists) and workplace (being able to elect and fire your own boss, being able to collectively decide on your workplace rights and conditions instead of it being decided by a handful of unelected capitalists). Socialism aims to destroy all these problems I mentioned before, while historically achieving these successes such as elimination of homelessness, 0% unemployment, near eradication of all poverty, democratic workplaces, almost nonexistent sex and drug trafficking, pulling millions from feudalist hellholes into developed societies in a span of decades, all things of which capitalism promises to solve but inherently causes all these things. That‚Äôs not to say socialism didn‚Äôt have its certain faults, but keep in mind that socialist governments and movements have constantly been pressured by imperialist capitalist forces, with threat of destruction both from outside (Cuba, Vietnam, Korea, Nicaragua, etc.) and within (USSR, Chile, Guatemala, countless others). Capitalists have done everything they possibly could to destroy the rights of the working class, and history has proven the steps they have taken to destroy anything holding the rich accountable for their actions. The Cold War, despite common misconception,\nwas not about socialist aggression, but capitalist imperialism trying to destroy any resemblance of the workers owning what they produce, as it has shown with the USSR initially trying to cooperate with the US and other NATO countries before being betrayed.\n\nSo, fortunately, no toothbrush sharing. I can‚Äôt go on forever, and there is so much more to talk about, but if you‚Äôre not a socialist before reading this, I hope you look at such with an open mind and continue learning more and more about it, instead of being fed constant lies by capitalist-controlled media about socialism. Don‚Äôt worry, if you feel like an idiot in regards to socialism, it takes time. I was once a neoliberal too before learning about all this stuff. It takes a lot of time and reading to absorb this information and radicalize further and further to the left. For starters, I would definitely recommend some channels like Hakim, Second Thought, and Yugopnik for general introductions to socialism, and furthermore reading the books of Marx, Engels, Lenin, among other socialists. We socialists aim for a better future, one that capitalism has continually promised but failed to deliver, with equality and the climate only getting worse.

These ideas need to be burned out with a very hot knife....', ""I think it's important to explain why Tipping a landlord doesn't make sense because it's not just enough to violently react to how bad this videos logic is. \n\nTipping is used for 2 reasons: 1) to acknowledge exemplorary service and, whether we like it or not, 2) to supplement the income of service workers who do make at or under minimum wage. \n\nWhen a landlord offers a place for rent  they are not providing you a service, they are leasing you an asset. It would be the same thing as tipping a car dealership for leasing you a car or a mortgage company giving you a loan. While they are providing a service to the market and some part of their job is service oreinted, their primary function is not to provide a service to you but facilitate the stewardship of an asset. It's important to distinguish that you're not buying a property for a set amount of time, you're leasing it. This means that the balance of power is in the hands of the owner of the asset - in this case the landlord. And its why at the end of the video, because the landlord is in control of the asset still, that they can determine to increase rent at will based on the willingness of the market to pay that price. But they cannot force you to pay more for an asset that has already been leased at a preexisting agreed upon rate. \n\nThat fact out of the way, lets dive into the nuance. Tipping is originally used as a way to distribute wealth between those with extra wealth and those without. Service workers in many cases still make below minimum wage and employers are able to charge less than minimum wage due to the difference being recouped in tips. While employers shouldn't be taking advantage of this broken system and we're seeing tip inflation as costs of living increase, tipping culture is generally about the transfer of wealth to those with less. \n\nSo if this video creator were to try again using the same messed up logic they used originally, they may come to the conclusion that they should tip their residents for providing the service of keeping the assets under their management in good condition, or else they may incur additional maintenance costs when they find the kitchen sink smashed into their front door."", 'Unless this is self aware cringe, this comes off as the most conceited bs', ""Rage bait I assume.

For a neighborhood like ours, which with its daily practice tries to resist those who oppress it. Whether we\'re talking about an authority that carries guns and shields or comes with bulldozers and drills or holds briefcases full of money, the carnival is here to lay it bare! The carnival is not only a disguise, it is not only entertainment, it is not a product to be consumed, but an imaginative and daring proposal: to take back our lives in our hands, to expose the hypocrisy of our ""masters"".\n\nSo we invite you to meet again in the streets.

(WATE) ‚Äî The family of a woman who died in Knoxville Police custody is speaking out after body camera video of her interaction with law enforcement was released.\n\n> Family members of Lisa Edwards remember her as independent, outgoing, caring, and a great mother. Her son Tim Boylan said that no matter what, his mother always put her sons first.\n\n> ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe she was treated the way she was. I just can‚Äôt even wrap my head around it. I just want people to remember her as a loving, caring person,‚Äù Tim Boylan said. ‚ÄúNot what these guys made her out to be. The security guards were saying all kinds of stuff that‚Äôs not true about her. She did not deserve to be treated like that. Nobody does.‚Äù\n\n> The Knox County District Attorney‚Äôs Office said that Edwards was on a flight on February 4 from Rhode Island to Knoxville when she began complaining of stomach pain, prompting her initial hospital visit. Lisa‚Äôs family say she moved from Tennessee to Rhode Island around Christmas of 2018.\n\n> While living in Rhode Island, Edwards suffered her first stroke that left her physically disabled in August 2019, but she was still mentally sound according to daughter-in-law August Boylan.\n\n> ‚ÄúShe was able to make her own decision as far as you know wanting to move back to Tennessee. She had a plan in place. She was discharged from a nursing home that had her helped arrange her flight to fly back to Tennessee. She was going to be living with a friend in Tennessee,‚Äù she said.\n\n> Edwards was taken by paramedics to Blount Memorial Hospital after the flight where she was evaluated and discharged according to the TBI‚Äôs investigation. The District Attorney‚Äôs Office said she sought additional treatment at Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center where she was observed overnight before she was released early the next morning. When Edwards refused to leave, security guards issued her a warning for disruptive behavior and trespassing, and then called Knoxville Police Department, who arrested her, the DA‚Äôs office released.\n\n> After finding out about the investigation, August Boylan questioned what could have happened for the officers to be placed on administrative leave and for an investigation with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to be launched. As a registered nurse, and knowing her mother-in-laws health history, she also said she recognized that they did not have all of the information.\n\n> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally irrelevant of how she got to where she was that morning, but that whole situation that played out for an extended period of time is horrible, absolutely horrible,‚Äù August Boylan said. The police officers may not have done anything intentionally criminal to cause anything to happen to her, but they definitely were negligent and had no respect for human life, any basic needs, anything.‚Äù\n\n> August Boylan said she watched the police video with District Attorney Charme Allen before it was released, but Tim Boylan said he has not. August Boylan explained that she was disgusted to the extent that she was sick to her stomach after watching the video. She said that as a nurse, she doesn‚Äôt understand how someone could fake things like it was claimed she was, such as the inability to use her left side and her muscle atrophy.\n\n> ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be a medical professional to know what the signs of stroke are. And you can see that in her, you know, start to finish. Her speech is completely changes from start to finish. And you know it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs, she‚Äôs struggling to breathe. That is not somebody working themself up like they said in there. That is not somebody faking it. She, I mean, she said it herself, that she was dying, that she was having a stroke.‚Äù\n\n> Edward‚Äôs family is still in disbelief of how she was treated.\n\n> ‚ÄúIf I treated someone the way they treated her, I‚Äôd be in jail right now heading to prison,‚Äù Tim Boylan said. ‚ÄúWhy are they not? I have no idea.‚Äù\n\n> The DA‚Äôs office released that no charges were filed for the officers involved in the situation, however, Knoxville Police said that an internal administrative investigation was ongoing for the four officers involved when the police video was released.', 'This fucking system man', ""The whole thing is disgusting but I hate that her last moments on this earth were being yelled and abused by the police.

316,The garbage of the rich.," Nothing is equivalent to nothing.  
Money is the general equivalent of all things *only* in the factual account of the economy.  
It is in reality the universal alchemist, who indeed transforms everything into gold; *but into gold that turns everything into mud.*  
To make one thing equivalent to another is not only to deprive it of its own value, but above all to denature it and to denature the relation implied in its nature.  
A merchant‚Äôs smile is no longer a smile, but the grin of a merchant.  
What is bought is not reality, but its economic version, which distorts all reality.  
In the economic version of reality, everything can be bought and sold, except to those who cannot afford to pay.  
And since only the rich can afford to pay for everything, all reality belongs to the rich, in act or in potential, minus the crumbs.  
The crumbs belong to the poor, but not even as crumbs; as the waste of the rich; as what remains of reality, once the rich have used it, and used it, to make all things equivalent to money; to denature all things.  
Reality has become the garbage of the rich, and the poor the garbage collectors.

338,"I really need to say something about the argument around ""pursuing your passion"" as a career choice.","There is a reason that following your passion ruins what you love, when it becomes a career. The amount of labor you have to put in to earn a living will always burn you out, regardless of what you're doing. Human beings cannot sustain one activity for 8+ hours a day and not become miserable. Our capitalist society expects us to perform labor as if we are machines. We repetitively perform work in one particular discipline all day. Human beings are not evolved to do that. We can sustain one kind of activity for two to four hours at best. Then, we need to take a break from that to do something restorative. It is really unnatural to spend every waking hour working on spreadsheets, welding, or asking people if they want fries with their meal.

The system expects humans to perform like machines. We are not machines. We are humans, and the nature of work must reflect that or misery becomes pervasive, killing productivity. We already know that productivity drops rapidly as the number of working hours are increased. Productivity increases when our livelihood is tied to getting work done instead of maintaining labor of a certain pace for a specific amount of time. People do a much poorer job if they know the only reward for getting work done is more work to fill that arbitrary number of hours. So they do the bare minimum and spread it out over the mandated number of hours.

Think about it. What would you rather do? Would you prefer to work a set number of hours, doing work that is never truly ""done"" to fill in the time so you get your 40 hours of pay, or would you prefer to get the work done, get paid enough to live on, and go enjoy your life? Life is about getting work done and moving on, not perpetually maintaining output.

The solution is to pay people a decent living, ending the work day when the job is done, not when the clock tells us we're done, and employing more people to divide the burden. This won't happen because it contradicts the goals of the people who make those decisions. What affects the workers doesn't affect them. They want fewer workers who are paid as little as possible doing as much work as possible. This can't last because it always forces this downward pressure on wages in order to maintain ever-increasing profits. You can't violate the laws of thermodynamics, so that increased profit has to come from somewhere. That somewhere is to make workers perform more labor for less money or have them buy the goods they themselves produced for more than it costs in materials and labor (actually it's a little of both).

To solve this, you have to make the people doing the work be in charge of what work is done and how it is done. People need to be self-directed in the workplace and have an understanding that they are done working when the work is finished, not when the required number of hours have been clocked. This rewards efficient, quality work. People who do fast, high-quality work get more leisure time. Do it right, do it fast, go home, and pursue your passions.  Then, finally, people can pursue their passions while doing socially meaningful work to maintain a stable living.",11dik72,25,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/11dik72/i_really_need_to_say_something_about_the_argument/,"['##Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism\n\n This subreddit is for news, discussion, memes, and links criticizing capitalism and advancing viewpoints that challenge liberal capitalist ideology.

If capitalism is a continuous process of converting money into commodities => producing different commodities through labor => selling them on the market (or selling those produced goods at a markup in service jobs) => repeating the process with the new money acquired, then that process had to start somewhere; there had to be a ‚Äúprimitive accumulation‚Äù of capital in order to kickstart capitalism essentially.\n\nHow does capitalism kickstart? As Marx says in the chapter, ‚ÄúIn actual history, it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the greatest part.‚Äù Buying other people‚Äôs labor power, and keeping that labor power cheap, plays another part. Some people, particularly the merchant class and landowners, through the colonies, begin to actually accumulate capital at a faster rate [edit: than aristocrats whose wealth was large but wasn‚Äôt *growing*]. Although the Spanish didn‚Äôt really *grow* too much and sat on their laurels, England and Germany suddenly got an influx of gold from the Spanish conquests which went to the merchant class.\n\nThe kickstarting (or bootstrapping lol) of capitalism also requires another factor which Marx mentions in the next chapter: the expropriation of land. Feudal peasants were largely self-sufficient. They didn‚Äôt need to buy firewood or food or meat or whatever, they made it, went into the forest, hunted it, bred it, wove it, or they traded with the people that did. That‚Äôs not conducive to capitalism. It required the expropriation of feudal land to begin large scale agriculture and manufacturing. It required those peasants to be ejected from their largely self sufficient system that existed before, and to be thrown out on the ‚Äúlabor market‚Äù for their lives to be bought and sold by the class that just ejected them from their homes. They have to buy firewood from the capitalist that owns the once communal forest now, who hires their once peasant friends to chop lumber who now live in workhouses owned by landlords. As Marx says in the primitive accumulation chapter, ‚Äúthe so-called primitive accumulation is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer (of commodities) from the means of production.‚Äù Sure, they didn‚Äôt own their means of production entirely beforehand. But the aristocrats largely didn‚Äôt interfere with their homes and their once communal property. \n\nSome more recent theorists (I forgot their name) claim that primitive accumulation isn‚Äôt a single event; in order to become a global economic system, this process needs to occur in every society at some point in its history. And it continues to occur in capitalist societies. \n\nThe rise of the internet, at one point pretty anarchist in its infrastructure, through legal fuckery, became monopolized by large companies that were able to own domain names and sell them to people among other things that I don‚Äôt have the time to look up right now.  The rise of crypto was also a primitive accumulation event. The discovery of oil was one too. As Capital seeks new areas of growth, any time it finds an untapped resource, an untapped market, it invades, buys up as much of it as it can, and then sells it to people that once got it for free, bleeding it dry for as much value as it can extract. That is primitive accumulation.']"

Physicians are placed into a system that abuses and uses them to generate profit off the suffering of others. They often burn out and I don‚Äôt blame them.

Unfortunately, human metabolism is dynamic and variable, making pharmaceutical treatment less concrete and invariable as we would desire it to be. Humans are a complex mix of their natures and their environments. Our DNA and our experiences have a complex dynamic interchange and this makes medicine all the more complex. Thus, the capitalistic hellscape we live in is most certainly a determining cause of mental health and poor health outcomes. Further, the capitalistic machinery destroys everything in its path so it may be more accurate to view psychiatrists, at least the good ones, as people fighting for change within a system that exploits them.

I went through 6 psychiatrists before I found one that actually cared about me as a human being and worked with me to make my life better.\n\nIndividual psychiatrists are potentially just cogs in a wheel. Or potentially fantastic people. Keep looking.\n\nI had better luck with a nurse practitioner. Specifically APRN, PMHNP-BC. Try looking for one of those. \n\nAlso go to therapy in concert. My therapist is a real person who I talk to regularly about the injustice present in our current society. \n\nFundamentally neither of these people can change the world. But they can change your life.', 'This would be kinda like your medical doctor treating your cancer from a toxic spill by your house and you saying ‚Äúare medical doctors just trying to treat my condition and not fix the underlying cause!‚Äù Your psych can only help you deal with anxiety and depression related to capitalism, they can‚Äôt fix capitalism.', 'As somebody who works as a psych tech and is in RN school, the short answer is you‚Äôre close. In my opinion, many mental health professionals may not necessarily understand what you‚Äôre talking about, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we all do not. Personally, I went into deep depression for about four years in my early twenties. I exposed myself to everything; central banking, government corruption, rampant use of cancer causing agents in foods, never ending wars in the name of the Petro-dollar, you name it. Nowadays, I‚Äôll actually have patients come up to my face and rant to me about these things that, in fact, they are right about. They probably think they‚Äôre just ranting to another person who thinks they‚Äôre insane and is scared of them. They‚Äôre always surprised to hear my response if they‚Äôre not too manic to the point where they won‚Äôt listen.\n\nAfter those years and successful integration of severe childhood trauma, I came out the other side an overall happy, yet somewhat cynical person. I never lost my sense of humor or love of what life has to offer. \n\nAlong the way, my parents threw me in rehab. They tried to pin all kinds of things on me. Bipolar, drug-induced psychosis (I smoked weed), depression, etc. I have them the finger. \n\nWhat had happened was, I allowed myself to be exposed to all of the terrible things in the world after keeping my head in the sand for 19 years. I still remember the day the switch flipped. I was listening to a song by Northlane and they had a sample from a man named Terence McKenna. After that, I learned all kinds of terrible and beautiful things most people never bother to think about. \n\nFunny enough, I happened upon a psychiatrist one day who sold me my weed card. He would basically tell me my own thoughts before I had even had a chance to mention them. I‚Äôd never heard a mental health professional talk like him. If he didn‚Äôt have the letters ‚ÄúMD‚Äù after his name, I‚Äôm certain he would have similar labels thrown at him. \n\nI eventually figured out that what it boils down to is that it‚Äôs okay to be aware of these things (corruption and sadness), but you CANNOT scare other people with that knowledge or obsess over it to the point where it starts to effect you emotionally. I see many guys come and go from my facility with exactly what I dealt with. The family gets scared, you get the baker act, then boom, you‚Äôre in a facility, talking to me. I was there too. \n\nI am blessed with health, so I have options to make money and expand my possibilities. One day, that may not be the case. When that day comes, I‚Äôll go for a long swim and I won‚Äôt come back. You have to accept the hand life dealt you. If you cannot, by all means, walk into congress with an AK-47; I really don‚Äôt blame you either way. That sentence is kind of hyperbole, but not really. Just about anybody can find meaning and happiness. Its my job to try and help people see the possibilities, no matter how dire the situation. The brain can put on blinders to the point where you see no hope. For some people, however, we must accept that for certain reasons, that hope may be impossible. \n\nMy psychiatrist gave me the willpower to do what I do today. We‚Äôre not all full of shit. I decided that I made it out of hell, and was willing to go back in to help pull others out. Have my upvote.', 'No.', ""Take one example. ADHD sometimes called ADD. Diagnosis has skyrocketed among school-age children coincidentally schools are overcrowded and under resourced. Many if not most initial ADHD concerns are raised by teachers to the parents.\n\nImagine a classroom with 30 7-year-olds and one teacher. How much of a conspiracy do you think it takes? This is a systemic problem. A sociological problem if you will, but it is being funneled through psychiatry. There's no conspiracy needed.\n\nSimilarly anytime therapists ignore clients environment including their work environment or the social and political climate they are likely to to miss important factors that lead to disorders. Unfortunately they are not trained to examine social systems. \n\nIs it possible to be a sane person in an insane world?\n\nEDIT: The Reddit robot sent me a message accusing me of using ableist language to describe the world.

The neoliberal propaganda is strong and most leftist spaces are still fully hoodwinked by it. \n\nAnyone with a historical materialist viewpoint on psychiatry knows that the history of psychiatrists and their patients is a history of abusers and victims.

I've had panic attacks for as long as I could remember, and therapy helps"", ""I'm convinced that capitalism is the source of many/most mental health problems. Medication can help a lot of people; however, if the environmental and social factors that contributed to their mental health struggles weren't present there wouldn't be the need for treatment in the first place. Some people are likely to be more susceptible to mental health issues, but these are exacerbated by lifestyle. \n\nKinda like how doctors can successfully treat asthma, but if air quality was better there wouldn't be as much asthma to treat."", ""I'm a counsellor myself (social work). Haven't met many good psychiatrists, and psychologists are hit and miss. That doesn't mean it's a quack profession, it means it's a hard job, and new advances are always being made that aren't always kept up with, largely because of a lack of funding and support ‚Äî enabled by rhetoric like yours."", ""Not really quacks, but...\n\nI have been thinking about it. I was on ADHD meds for a year because i wasn't productive enough for society, and it almost broke me. I stopped it completely and vowed not to take it ever again.\n\nIt works, and works in keeping me depending on it."", ""I believe psychiatry is to help us improve and manage mental health conditions. Reducedstress,anxiety and depression won't fix social ills, but it does put me in a better mental condition to deal with them"", ""Just because lots of people get depressed and anxious living in a broken system doesn't mean mental illness doesn't exist.  Topping capitalism isn't going to fix your bi-polar disorder.  \n\nOn a serious note, perhaps seek another psychiatrist.  I have a loved one who was diagnosed with BP-II, spent years trying to deal with issues they thought were BP-related, but eventually were also diagnosed with ADHD.  The whole time they were never being medicated properly.  It's normal for it to be difficult to find the right combo of meds, but if you are going through dozens of them, perhaps they are missing something."", ""I'm sure there are some, but the ones I've gone to genuinely want to help. My meds don't pacifier me, but help me get a better grip on my mental state. I have an anxiety disorder and my meds help prevent panic attacks that prevent me from sleeping but I still deal with anxiety on the daily. I have seasonal depression that can put me in a semi-catatonic state, but now I still experience the emotions but have the energy to work on it."", ""I've been to a few psychs in my day, and with my history of drug abuse they're understandably slow to react with meds. I've had a lot of success and failures, but overall it's been a net positive for me, my family, and the capitalist bastards who make millions exploiting my fellow workers and me. \n\nIndividual results may vary, but it's saved me a lot of jail time, and for that, I'm grateful."", 'They definitely CAN be that way. I was detained for against my will for having suicidal ideation and I was treated terribly.  \n\nBut psychiatrists do serve a purpose that helps many people.  It really just depends on the situation.', 'Possibly. I know I\'m struggling right now with therapy. I tend to become very upset when people do stupidly dangerous shit. Or behave in a way that puts them above others to the detriment of those other people. \n\nMy therapist is finding it hard to find a way to phrase ""Just let assholes be assholes and ruin the world and just try to avoid them as much as possible."" Without admitting there\'s really nothing wrong with my attitude about it.', 'Yes.\n\nAnd other than the insane loans I would have had to take out to sustain a move from Atlanta to California AND to live in Palo Alto...\n\n...learning that psychology is philosophically crippled at its core, helplessly pimped out by capitalism/big pharma, and that it was ultimately about drugging and conditioning people (children and teens especially) into enduring a system that should be torn down...\n\n...is one of the many reasons I declined Palo Alto University\'s invitation to their PhD Clinical Psychology Program. \n\n5 years and a 3.94 GPA, and I still wasn\'t smart enough to see that the field simply isn\'t ""meta"" enough to actually help anyone.', ""Doc here (but not a psychiatrist) - The answer here is definitely NO they are not quacks. I've requested psych consults on patients in the past and there is a lot more to what they do outside of your personal experience. Some people are a genuine danger to themselves and/or society and we need professionals who can properly diagnose and treat them no different than any other specialty."", ""No. But yes.\n\nThey're not doing that, but the most common system to be used in mental health is a fusion of medications and behavioural psychology. This approach totally ignores the roots of mental issues, just prescribing the symptoms and the ammount of treatment someone should receive when displaying those symptoms.\n\nI do hate it as a psychologist because its incredibly cruel. For example, if you have a worker that is depressed due to being pressured at his job, his working conditions won't be analized or be of any concern. Your job is to aplly the checklist on the diagnosis book, prescribe the right drugs and do the listed psychological technics (usually there's even how long you should treat the patient). When its done, he must come back to work, being considered able as he received treatment. Nothing would change on his work environment and so you know he will get sick again. If he's not ok, he would be considered able, after he's cleared to work because he completed the treatment; he can then be fired - or more often, forced to leave his job under some pressure, like changing his working schedule to a time that's impossible for him or something like that. He won't get any compensation or treatment from then on. Someone else would be hired because its cheaper; or they would make an excuse and make the workers to do the same job with less one person working there. Its a very cruel and sad system that only works on paper, but keeps profiting the elite."", 'People need sound counsel, whether its from family, a priest, a community leader, or a therapist/psychiatrist. \n\nOur society *is* more likely to medicalize people and prescribe drugs to rectify behavior than do anything to address the root causes of the behavior, but there isnt anything wrong with seeking psychiactric help (potentially including medication) in the mean time.\n\nThe reality is that we do have a broken society, a society that traumatizes and retraumatizes us through its most basic mechanisms, because peoples lives and labor are commoditized. It would be better to fix the root causes, but we need to care for ourselves pending change in the best ways we can manage because to not do so just results in being disempowered and marginalized, plunging us into places where we are less capable of affecting change at all.', 'Even beyond capitalism, humans are hurt by life in society. Psychiatry has for goal to accommodate this, it‚Äôs respectable', ""As a doctor, psychiatrists aren't quacks. People do benefit from medications to manage their mental health. \n\nI do agree that alot of mental health research doesn't account for systemic or material concerns. Some people need new circumstances in life to feel better(I would wager these are most cases). Some people just have a chemical imbalance."", ""I think it's probably true that poor economic and social conditions are contributing significantly to the rise in mental health disorders that we're seeing in America.\n\nThat said traditional Western medicine can be helpful. I take an antidepressant every morning. I don't I would be alive today without it. It doesn't cure my depression but it makes it manageable."", ""Some psychiatrists try to help, but I've met one who literally asked what drugs I needed..."", 'Yeah theyre basically quacks. Mental illness is a social construct, and they are all abritrary and opinion based.\n\nAnd the idea of psychiatric medicine is just bizzare. Imagine trying to treat loneliness with a pill. Psychiatric illness is NOT equivalent to a broken leg, its mostly your conditions and your beliefs interacting with your personality. People can be cured of these ""diseases"" often simply by changing their beliefs (as proven by the effectiveness of psychadelics).\n\nAnd yes, individualising solutions to collective problems is a way of disharging energy in a way that is harmless to the system.']"

391,A movie scene written by Chat-GPT about a man who is completely fed up with capitalism,"After some attempts of getting the most politically correct neutral replies i finally got it to share some of its thoughts about capitalism in the form of a movie scene.

INT. A CROWDED COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JOHN, a middle-aged man with glasses, sits at a table, sipping on his coffee. He looks agitated and deep in thought.

JOHN (under his breath) It's just ridiculous. This whole system is built on exploitation and greed. How can we allow billionaires to exist in our world?

Suddenly, John's friend, MARK, enters the coffee shop and approaches the table.

MARK Hey, John! What's on your mind?

JOHN (sighing) I'm just so tired of this whole system. It's absurd that a few people can accumulate so much wealth while millions struggle to make ends meet.

MARK But isn't that just the way things are? Some people are just better at making money than others.

JOHN (angrily) No, it's not. It's a rigged game. The rules are set up to benefit the wealthy and powerful. Meanwhile, the rest of us are left to scrape by.

Mark looks taken aback by John's sudden outburst.

JOHN (pacing) And don't even get me started on the environmental impact of all this. These billionaires and their corporations are destroying our planet in the pursuit of profit above all else.

Mark tries to interject, but John keeps going.

JOHN And what about the social unrest that comes with such vast wealth inequality? It's a recipe for disaster.

Mark looks sympathetic, but he still seems unsure of how to respond.

JOHN (sighing) I just can't take it anymore. Something has to change.

Mark nods, looking thoughtful.

MARK You know what, John? You're right. It's time for us to demand a new system. One that values people over profits. One that ensures that everyone has a fair shot at a decent life.

John looks at Mark, surprised and relieved.

JOHN (smiling) You're damn right it is.

As they continue their conversation, the other patrons in the coffee shop start to listen in. Some nod in agreement, and a few even join in the discussion. It's clear that John's heartfelt rant has struck a chord with many people.",11ckk8u,19,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/11ckk8u/a_movie_scene_written_by_chatgpt_about_a_man_who/,"['##Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism\n\n This subreddit is for news, discussion, memes, and links criticizing capitalism and advancing viewpoints that challenge liberal capitalist ideology.

And the interest on the debt is profit made by anybody who invests in us bonds.', '""The Debt"" is really just a tool to give money some kind of authority. In late medieval England, the first central bank gave the king a loan of 1 million pounds (to fund a war, of course) and then started issuing coins and banknotes which took their value from the fact that the king as sovereign could never conceivably default, and that the king would always accept these notes and coins as taxation in order to pay of his own debt. All central banking is an extension on this idea.\n\nIn essence, what this means is that the US federal reserve bank loans money to the US government at interest and then sells a stake in that debt to a private investor. Aside from the physical minting of currency, this is how money is made. A dollar is a promissory note that guarantees the US government will honour the value and accept it as taxation because its own debt to the central bank is quantified by dollars.\n\nThe idea that the debt is purely related to fiat currency is a bit of a misunderstanding. The US was using central bank bonds for quite a while when the dollar was pegged to the value of gold: as were all the European central banks which preceded the US Fed. Nixon\'s decoupling of gold and the US dollar was a wealth transfer from the third world, as most third world nations didn\'t have gold stocks, but had US government bonds - they were equal in value, and much easier to store etc. When the price of the dollar detached from gold, the value of gold went up and the value of the dollar went down - which was great for the US and Europe because they had been transferring all the gold to their own banks for a good century by then.\n\nAnyway, the answer is pretty complex and historically contingent. I\'d recommend David Graeber\'s \'Debt: The First 5,000 Years\' as the most comprehensive resource on how this all works.', ""Countries decided a while a go that money doesn't matter. Debt is the new income. The system is so broken that you can be poor or rich in both directions, depending on the individual amount of power you wield. Not paying a dollar for a frozen burrito is a tragedy, but not paying a trillion to erase student loan debt is a statistic."", 'Why do I hear this as the the rant in the beginning solar opposites.', 'Vast majority is interest on interest, piled on annually.', 'It represents the way we can scam the rest of the world out of the most valuable natural resources', 'Because greedy rich', 'Because we refuse to raise taxes on the super rich or reduce the ridiculously high amount we spend on the military.', '3 decades of tax cuts, pandemic spending.', ""Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't like 10% of it WW2 war bonds that will never be cashed in?"", ""It's literally just the total amount of USD in existence.

I would like to add some historical and present information to this. 1 no government has ever paid it\'s debts to another government in the history of the world. 2 while you may see we owe china enormous amounts of money. They actually owe us money too. It\'s a weird political thing countries do were they borrow from each other but never pay the money back. \n\nWith all that said. The only thing that is really concerning about the national debt is the printing money part. All these numbers are added together to drive fear and push political agendas. While some in the government print money to cover ""future progress"". You may want to keep in mind the government just doesn\'t pay back it\'s debts part. Like if a bank came forward with 2 trillion in bonds and was like we need this money. Some people would probably end up dead and the us treasuries would probably magically need to take over the bank to save it from a sudden financial calamity (see https://www.cia.gov/  for more info)', 'It‚Äôs to force people to work. \n\nThe government owes money? More than it can ever pay? People must work their whole lives to pay off debts they did not incure.

Some of these liberals straight up do not know the first thing about communism other than the black book of communism and ‚Äúvuvuzela no ifone.‚Äù It‚Äôs frustrating as hell to have to wade through mountains of liberals that don‚Äôt want to educate themselves on the basic principles of a sub they‚Äôre on. They just want to doomscroll about how bad things are on here and meme about it rather than putting in the work to make things better and I‚Äôm sick of it.\n\nCommunism is a political practice that‚Äôs highly connected with its own branch of economics and political theory, and it‚Äôs own philosophical history. The ideas Karl Marx and the writers that came after him developed are used in nearly every branch of the social sciences (edit: and the humanities), especially sociology. This type of theory is ubiquitous in grad school and postgraduate research all over the world and it‚Äôs not a huge ask to learn a bit of sociology in order to participate in conversations about society. If you want to scientifically improve our conditions, it‚Äôs necessary to do so. And that‚Äôs why commies place such a high importance on theory, and on the implementation of theory (praxis). \n\nAgain, you don‚Äôt need to know everything about it, I don‚Äôt, but if you want to participate, the least you can do is educate yourself about these basic concepts rather than parroting some state department anticommunist propaganda, because in a communist sub, that‚Äôs solely spam that adds zero value to the conversation. It actually lessens the value of the conversation because us commies have to wade through a literal mountain of uneducated horseshit from libs in order to find the good replies that actually understand sociology/economics enough to have good, nuanced takes on situations.\n\nAnd also: you can write a scathing critique of the USSR using the works of Marxist and Marxist-adjacent social theorists. (Edit: the Frankfurt School of theorists made a living off of critiquing the USSR, and they‚Äôre still massively influential even among communists because of, not despite, their critiques of the ussr). If you don‚Äôt want to put in the effort to make a scientific critique at the level of a short university sociology discussion post, then a communist sub is not the place for you. We‚Äôre dedicated to scientifically resolving class struggle, and that takes a desire to organize, a desire to act, and a desire to learn the best way to do so. We have hundreds of years of political theory and sociological theory under our belt that guide our actions. It‚Äôs prideful to think that you can just organize a revolution without studying from your predecessors, even if you disagree with them. And the mountains of smug liberal horseshit on this sub are proof of that.', 'Is this about the Estonia ban?', 'This has been the case for years. It‚Äôs eternally September around here for liberals.', 'Liberals don\'t hate capitalism. They are pro-capitalism *by definition*. And they always try to co-opt leftist spaces rather than actually coming left and becoming socialist. Even the most ""well-intentioned"" ones are trying to save capitalism.

Smith. That means supplanting desks and cubicles with more inviting and comfortable furniture, like plush sofas, area rugs, TVs, succulents, armchairs, or even fireplaces. These settings would ideally bridge the stark gap between the comforts of home and the traditionally cold corporate workplace, he writes.\n\nThese kinds of comforts in the office aren‚Äôt entirely new; perennially unbuttoned businesses, such as startups and tech companies, have long embraced zany, unique workplaces. Now, that style might become the norm, Talia Olson, a Washington-based interior designer, told Smith. ‚ÄúA lot of this is getting people back into the office after we‚Äôve been working from home for some time, so why not design a space that has that feeling?‚Äù\n\nBalancing comfort with compromise\n\nDespite the appeal of the new trend (who doesn‚Äôt prefer a chaise longue to a swivel chair?), ‚Äúresimercial‚Äú designs can‚Äôt supersede the real point of the office: a space conducive to productive work. \n\nAside from serving as a natural place to convene and ideate out loud, offices can also function as a refuge from the manifold distractions plaguing workers at their home office. Maybe they have young kids, a roommate also working in the same close quarters, or a spouse using the blender during a conference call. On the other hand, workers whose homes have become an oasis of calm may experience a slight culture shock when arriving back in an office with so much chatter. \n\n‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôve spent two years alone, you [can] become very sensitive to noise,‚Äù Jeremy Myerson, emeritus professor at the Royal College of Art and coauthor of Unworking, a book about the modern office, told the Financial Times in December. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre hearing from HR departments is that people are hypersensitive to their environments.‚Äù \n\nThat goes in both directions; any given worker could prefer noise over silence, and office managers are facing the new task of appealing to both sides‚Äîand making an equal case for both of them to show up. \n\nThat‚Äôs why, in an office clearly geared toward in-person attendance, you can expect to see both private phone booths and pods (dubbed ‚Äúquiet spaces‚Äù) as well as bustling common areas and well-stocked open-plan kitchens.\n\nAnd whether workers are seated at a desk or curled up in front of a fireplace, the goal of feng shui should never overtake the goal of productivity. To that end, instead of shelling out on game rooms or beer fridges, companies have begun prioritizing ‚Äúsocially evolved‚Äù additions like mental wellness rooms, outdoor workspaces, and lactation rooms. ‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about employee health, employee wellness, employee productivity, and business continuity,‚Äù Joseph Allen, director of Harvard‚Äôs Healthy Buildings program and associate professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told Fortune in October. ‚ÄúMajor organizations are rethinking their approach to commercial real estate‚Ä¶because the C-suite has started to really pay attention to the key role that buildings play in the health of their people and their company.‚Äù', ""I can't help and feel disconnected from all this ,working from home stuff.

Rent is 900 Euros for a barely average  apartment - fuel 100 Euros - car insurance - 150 Euros - food 300 Euros.  Other insurance - internet - mobile phone - public transportation cards  etc etc

Some 400 I save and 200 I spend so that I can have at least some form of  life.

To pay of the loan for a 300 000 Euro House - pretty  cheap and perhaps 20% of all houses are below this price - mostly in desolate regions and conditions - I would need something like 60+ years.

The funny thing is that the mayor here was a really pro-Bolsonaro guy lol"", 'Before all the liberals on this subreddit start complaining that I posted a ""communist dictator"" on this subreddit, just consider yourself this with an open mind.\n\nCuba\'s revolution came in 1959 against the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. It was the inevitable result of the centuries of abuse the Cuban working masses faced under this oppression. While Cuba might have been luxurious from the top 1% which benefited off the labor of the 99%, the overwhelming majority of Cubans worked tiring exhausting days in plantations, working near slave-like conditions, so the US could essentially colonize the island and US companies could own and profit off of these resources, in expense of the cheap, hard labor by the Cubans. 83% of its total population was illiterate, more than 90% worked and lived in extreme poverty, death from overwork and exhaustion was common, and those who could not find a job were left on the streets to die.\n\nThis was all so the US, and a few rich individuals, could profit. That is the evil and tyranny of capitalism.\n\nNow, the Cuban revolution happens, overwhelmingly supported by the Cuban people. The plantation owners, who have abused the Cuban populace for centuries, faced harsh, but rightful, persecution. Many had no choice but to flee, taking their resources with them to the US, and those who didn\'t were forced to redistribute their land, give up their private property to be owned by those who produced it, and were trialed and punished for their crimes. Seems fair, right?\n\nThe US, however, does not like it when any country doesn\'t allow it to exploit its resources. In 1960, an embargo was enacted, with the CIA admitting that it was to starve out the Cuban people to make them turn on the government and start a counter revolution. Literally. That was, and is, the reason the embargo takes place. To kill people. To make them desperate. To confuse them. And to undermine Cuban self determination for its own capitalist hegemony.\n\nOperation Mongoose. The US, in a span of a few years, committed a series of terrorist attacks and bombings on the shores of Cuba, injuring and killing countless civilians. All for its imperialist, capitalist interests.\n\nIn 1963, the US was close to invading Cuba. Troops were trained in US-occupied Guatemala to invade and overthrow the government, reinstalling a fascist dictatorship that would undo all the reforms in favor of the Cuban workers, restoring the island back to its state before the revolution, so a few businessmen could profit. Perhaps millions could have died, just like in Vietnam, Laos, Korea, Iraq, Nicaragua, among other places the US has invaded for the sake of maintaining its own imperial dominance. If not for the USSR intervening in the Cuban missile crisis and a treaty being met, it would have happened. \n\nThe main interests of the US is to exploit the people of the Global South for cheap labor. To kill anyone, in order to achieve its goal. To bomb countries that do not let it exploit its cheap resources and labor. To ensure that wealth remains in the hands of a few individuals, rather than the masses.\n\nThe main interests of the Cuban people is to help. Cuba has never bombed, or invaded a country. Cuba has sent doctors to other countries. Not bombs.\n\nThis speech is so refreshing to me personally. The interests of the Cuban people are to help others, not destroy them. It wasn\'t the Cuban people who asked to be enemies with the US, it was the US government that imposed them as enemies.

It's just that now they trying to do it even faster.\n\nOne good example is Harlen, Bronx and South Manhattan. Those three counties got times where rich lived there, than turned into a slum and got back to rich people again."", 'Software engineer here. I write the software the the assessors and collectors use. Laws vary state by state but based off what I have seen here are a few pointers to look out for that may help you.\n\nFirst, depending on state and local law, reassessments are sometimes only allowed a certain time after the previous assessment. Make sure you know the laws that govern where you live and make sure that any new assessment follows these guidelines.\n\nSecond, make sure you know what exemptions your town or county offers. There are elderly exemptions but I have also seen exemptions for a multitude of random things such as disability, veteran status, being a fire fighter (volunteer or paid), being a municipal employee (teachers included), homestead exemption, and much much more. It never hurts to call the assessor in your area to find out if you qualify for an exemption! Also make sure your exemption was calculated correctly! I cannot tell you how many times I have seen assessors mistype an exemption. For example, if your exemption is a percentage based exemption, that means that a certain percent of your home‚Äôs value is exempt, say your home is worth 100k and your exemption is 20% so, your taxable amount should be 80k. I have seen instances of ‚Äúbugs‚Äù where the assessor put in the correct information after a tax payer complained but they changed the calculation to a credit, meaning it took $20 off the bill, not 20% off the homes value. So even if you get an exemption or exemptions, you need to know how they work. \n\nThird, not all municipalities offer this but some offer payment plans. Contact your local municipality to see if they offer one. Remember though, you have be up to date with your payments so if you are delinquent you probably won‚Äôt qualify. That is why it is important to sign up for them as soon as possible! Do not wait till you are delinquent! A minor point on this, understand when the payment or payments are due. Seems stupid but EVERY FUCKING municipality calculates interest differently and sometimes, that can add up to a lot very quickly. I know one where interest is not calculated based off the payment that is due but the entire tax you have been charged, even though not all the payments are due.\n\nFourth, if your bill is wrong, contact the assessor! They are responsible for generating accurate bills. Anything wrong with them should go right to the assessor. If there is an issue they will instruct collection to either put an adjustment on the bill or they will abate the whole bill (essentially remove it) and then reissue you a bill with the correct amounts. However, this does not always reset the clock for delinquency! That means even though they just issued you a bill, you may still owe interest. So when you find an issue report it asap to your assessor.\n\nFifth, not all municipalities have this but some do. This is the concept of ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù that they mentioned in the video but really did not explain well. Frozen means that either (or both) the tax rate and/or the assessment on your home can be frozen. The qualifications for having your rate and/or assessment frozen vary WILDLY so you need to check with your assessor as to how you could qualify. But, to help understand this better, say in 2005 you qualified for frozen and your tax rate was frozen at .5% and your homes assessment was frozen at $100k. That means that even if your home is now worth $500k and the rate is now 2%, your bill would still be 100,000x0.005 = $500 and not 500,000x0.02 = $10,000. \n\nLast, there are 2 offices you need to know about for most larger municipalities (smaller ones these are normally combined, and when I say small I mean like less that 5k people, not like city vs town), there is the assessors office and the collectors office (but I have also heard them called the treasury or the payment office). The assessor is responsible for the assessment of the property, the exemptions it gets, and the number of installments on a bill. They are not typically responsible for the tax rate, that is normally determine in the municipality‚Äôs budget hearing(s). The collection office is responsible for collecting the payments so that includes setting people up on payment plans, determining the interest to be charged, the due dates of payments, etc. Know what your issue is and who to call so you don‚Äôt get the run around!\n\nIf you have any questions ask away and I can answer with what I know.

Happy to have done it, my training now tells me how dangerous that was. But then we entered another cave after three minutes and ascended a chimney again to get back to maybe 70\'. Spectacular.\n\n3. The time a guide asked us if we\'d pay extra for a lobster lunch. We said yes, so he jumped overboard in his jeans with a snorkel and emerged from the water with lobsters he extracted from traps, and they were cooked on the boat. We met up with the owners of the traps on the water later, and paid for the lobsters.\n\n4.

579,A topic never discussed: COVID created a leisure class,"In the early stages of the pandemic, as things shut down and workplaces closed labor shifted in a dramatic way for many people. The massive shift into a work from home model has shaken out over these many years to become a mostly permanent thing for many, or at the very least a split week between office and home. A net benefit was granted to a massive chunk of the labor market due to a crisis. What was gained? The ability to do loads of laundry, workout, tidy a room, meal prep and let's be honest sit around and either have more free time or create more future free time on the clock. 

The other side of this coin are in person workers who not only remained working throughout the crisis, but often had their benefits eroded away under the guise of temporary changes needed to work through short staffing that never returned to the old status quo. 

COVID has created further stratification of labor. Many will read this and take offence. ""I work just as much at home as I did in the office. EVEN MORE THAN I USED TO"". I would say anecdotally anyone like that is an outlier. I would also say to you *how's that commute?*. 

Time is our most important resource. When you work out of your home you simply gain more of it. Your relationship with it is different. When you are trapped in a workplace keeping the gears of society turning, they own all of the time you spend there. They own all the time you spend getting there. They own you during your unpaid lunch breaks. The necessity of your presence changes your relationship with time. 

People who work from home SHOULD be using that time to create leisure. We are productive enough that it is the only way to stay sane. I'm just pointing out that many feel that COVID created a massive divide that is not often pointed out.",119236v,36,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/119236v/a_topic_never_discussed_covid_created_a_leisure/,"['##Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism\n\n This subreddit is for news, discussion, memes, and links criticizing capitalism and advancing viewpoints that challenge liberal capitalist ideology.

Doubled China\'s life expectancy from 33 when the PRC was founded to around 65 by the time he died. Doubled caloric intake. Quadrupled GDP. Ended serfdom in China and Tibet, hence the landlord memes. Strengthened the country such that no foreign powers invaded China since; a big deal considering China spent decades being ravaged, pillaged, and murdered by the Japanese, and British, among other nations. Abolished all discriminatory acts against women and made great strides in women\'s rights, famously stating ""Women hold up half the sky"". Paving the road for an industrialized China, China went from being poorer than any country in Africa to having its own space station in a few decades. Developed strong ties to African countries suffering under similar conditions that China was, stating ""It is our African brothers who have carried us into the UN"".\n\nCons: Great Leap Forward, which killed roughly 30 million, is widely acknowledged as a mistake by Chinese scholars and leaders alike, with Deng Xiaoping being very vocal about it. However, the effects of local government mismanagement, environmental conditions and China\'s long history of famines which also killed tens of millions are completely ignored by those making arguments against Mao specifically. Calling Mao \'the most evil man to ever exist\' because the GLF is literally braindead, considered famines of equal magnitude occurred in China centuries prior, and Mao\'s efforts did permanently end the cycle. Additionally, famines such as those by the British in India which killed many times more people are completely ignored by the people making such arguments. The cultural revolution, depending on who you ask, was also a huge mistake. It was good in abolishing certain mindsets such as women\'s inferiority, but also did deal lead to the loss of many traditions practiced for centuries. While many cultural practices did return after, they are more like historical trivialities than practices done seriously like before. Although it should be noted that even Taiwan, who didn\'t undergo the revolution doesn\'t necessarily practice old culture as well, making it a complicated situation.', 'God, I hate these poorly scoped questions. What specifically are you asking? ""The benefits"" and ""the drawbacks"" are vague and subjective ideas. Do a modicum of research first, then come back.\n\nSecondly, let\'s not do the liberal ""great man if history"" thing, k? Mao didn\'t run China. He didn\'t single handedly rule 750 million people. Individuals don\'t make history; the mass of people do. Leadership of China was in the hands of the CPC, and despite the western portrayal of it there is and was a constitutional order that involves mutual negotiations between local and national officials. That order persists into today.\n\nOk, with those caveats:\n\nThe accomplishments of the CPC during the Mao era are staggering. In addition to freeing China from the brutal Japanese occupiers and the fascist Kuomintang (which went on to establish a brutal military dictatorship in Taiwan), the Mao era saw significant material gains for almost all of society. The CPC ended feudal obligations, abolished foot binding, and began an industrialization project that would ultimately result in the abolition of extreme poverty in China. Mao also began the cultural revolution, which is widely despised by ignorant westerners but which led to empowering workers and peasants and the experimentation with forms of democracy that would have transformed how we think about governance.\n\nMao era foreign policy was a mixed bag. While I\'m sympathetic to his anti-revisionist position wrt the Sino-Soviet Split, it ultimately led to misguided attempts to marginalize other socialist revolutions and even led to violent conflict. It ultimately allowed the US and allied imperialist nations to drive a wedge in the socialist bloc and destroy the USSR. However, the CPC under Mao provided far more material support to revolutionary movements around the world than the USSR.\n\nMao\'s era was marred by a colossal failure: the great leap forward. In attempting to modernize the agricultural sector of China, misguided policies and incompetent local officials exacerbated an already terrible famine. Millions died as a result. While famine was common in China and the great famine had its origins in natural causes, the CPC undoubtedly worsened it.\n\nFinally, the failure of the cultural revolution led to the victory of what Mao would have termed ""capitalist roaders"". The current government of China is ideologically descended from the people who defeated the cultural revolution. We now have China employing a communist party to control a capitalist means of production, and that contradiction is driving a large part of Chinese policy. The end result is unknown. We should remain humble and open to the possibility that this experiment will succeed, or that it will fail.\n\nHope this helps.

Organized in 1889 with the help of Engels, and based, in large part upon the organizational success of it‚Äôs largest section, the German Social Democratic Party, it existed as a loose federation of the world‚Äôs socialist parties, most of whom described themselves as ‚ÄúMarxist‚Äù. It included openly reformist type organizations that saw a gradual implementation of reforms of capitalism to achieve socialism; socialist parties based on unions, or ‚ÄúLabor‚Äù parties; and revolutionary workers parties that saw the need to openly smash the capitalist state structure.*\n\n*The Socialist International was seen as an instrument of socialist revolution, cutting across international boundaries thrown up to divide the working class. After Engels death and continuing into the early 20th century, the class struggle in the United States and Europe heated up, opening fissures in the Socialist International. Several conferences, in 1907 and 1911 strengthened the internationalist perspective, opposing war and colonialism, but revealing these fissures. The German Social-Democracy, for example, voted at these conferences against the resolutions against colonialism, albeit they too were divided on this issue.*\n\n*August, 1914, the start of the First World War, marked, as Russian Marxist Leon Trotsky said ‚Äúthe effective death of the International.‚Äù He made this statement in response to the failure of the International to oppose the imperialist war. Instead of opposing the war, calling for the overthrow of their own capitalists and organizing strikes against it, the various International sections in France, Germany and Britain, voted for war credits and effectively sided with their own capitalist class to wage war.*\n\n*This was met with opposition within the ranks of all these sections to form Marxist and Internationalist factions that would work against this capitulation. Most notable were the Russian Marxists of the Russian Social-Democratic and Labor Party (Bolsheviks), who, 11 years earlier had split from their more reformist comrades in the Menshevik wing of the RSDLP. Along with Leon Trotsky (independent of any RSDLP faction) , Vladimir Lenin from the Bolsheviks, Rosa Luxemberg and Karl Liebnecht of the revolutionary wing of the German Social-Democracy and the majority of the Socialist Party of America lead by Eugene V. Debs, a broad internationalist response to this capitulation on behalf of the International started to coalesce.*\n\n*Various international conferences of Internationalist social-democrats occurred, the most famous one being the Zimmerwald conference of 1916. While failing to build an alternate Socialist International, it did bring together many of the forces that eventually built, in 1919 and under the auspices of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the 3rd, or Communist International.*\n\n*While the Socialist International remained a corpse throughout the war years, it did regroup, this time without it‚Äôs internationalist wing, now in the Communist International, in 1920 and 1921. By now organized as an ‚Äúanti-Communist‚Äù but ‚Äúpro-socialist‚Äù current, it included parties that had now shared state power, including the Australian and British Labour Parties, the German Social-Democracy, and, into the 30s, in many European countries. Clearly only interested in mild reforms in labor legislation and social welfare, the Socialist International clearly went over to the perspective of reforming capitalism, rather than overthrowing it.*\n\n*Today the Socialist International continues having sections that at one time or other ruled every capitalist country in Western Europe, and many in Latin America as well. It has shed any pretense toward establishing socialism and exists to help implement the globalization of world capitalism under the auspices of the World Trade Organization.*\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-international', '\nBernie Sanders killed Rosa \n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFdL4svwk75eA-5sDo0t7OXUd69Wtb5vc\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#social-democracy\n\n[Bernie Sanders & Cuba](https://youtu.be/ObvDNyDUnj0)\n\n\n[Socialist Reconstruction: A Better Future for the United States](https://www.liberationstore.org/products/socialist-reconstruction-a-better-future-for-the-united-states)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RJLA2_Ho7X0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5mWTmnLH0ec', 'first acheive it then think whether it is enough or not', '[removed]']"

We may not all agree on what the ""best"" way forward is, but I think we might be able to find common ground in that we all want to see our world be a better place. As long as we are moving forward, thats all that matters. If we can raise ourselves, then maybe we can raise those around us too.

That concept still stands.\n\nThere is a lot of research on human happiness and satisfaction, and one theme that keeps coming up is the correlation between happiness and having healthy social connections.

Also, compared to console gaming PC games can be quite cheap because, despite Steams stranglehold, there is actually some competition and sales/bundles. Add in the number of quality free games you can scoop up, features like Steams Remote Play Together (which can be used to play games from other services as well without much effort), a handful of quality free2play titles, and pretty good value from Microsoft\'s subscription service means if you\'re already in the hardware ""ecosystem"" you don\'t have to spend much to play new things.  \n\nI think maybe you mean capitalism has ruined AAA gaming (or is ruining, there\'s still some pretty good stuff occasionally) but that shouldn\'t really be a surprise, it ruins, or at least tarnishes everything eventually.  \n\nIt\'s also worth considering that you\'re likely running into a little nostalgia bias.

When perhaps you only played a handful of new games a year and so you just found ways to enjoy what you had. Also the more games you play the harder it is to find a truly new experiences, especially if your scope is limited to major releases from high profile studios, and it\'s easy to conflate that as a drop in quality on the games part.  \n\nOn the issue of perceived slowed graphics improvements I think it\'s probably true to say that the average ""screenshot"" fidelity hasn\'t improved much, when you\'re pushing photorealism there is much room to grow with texture fidelity, but I think that misses what has improved visually. Unfortunately some of the improvements are locked behind high end cards (real time ray tracing) and/or high end peripherals ( 4k or high fps screens, VR). Outside of that there have been improvements in GPU computed realtime physics and particle systems and just how much stuff can be rendered at once and at what distance.', ""I had a similar dilemma a while back and my solution was to get into modding.

You can add ZRP and Starter Pack mods to bring it up to modern standards. You can download Stalker Radiophobia 3, a remaking of that same game that is quite advanced and doesn't require the base game. You can download Stalker Anomaly, which takes the maps from all the games from that series, puts them together, adds a new story, and updates gameplay (add Gamma on top).

It's a cautionary tale really:\n\n1) The formula for the highest allowed rent for new tenants is based on the current value of the object, which is calculated by big bank algorithms and spiraling upwards in most places. For tax purposes though the houses are valued based on the mortgage, which is the signicantly lower value.\n\n2) Landlords can legally raise rent by 0.5% per year every year for administrative services without providing proof of actually increased costs on their part.\n\n3) The court that decides tenants cases has been stacked with judges from the most landlord-friendly party. That's a very suspicious outlier in our vibrant multi-party system.\n\n4) The biggest offenders are pension funds. Boomers that live in their own homes are therefor subsidised by tenants.\n\n5) When interest rates drop, every tenant for himself has to drag his landlord through arbitration and argue for the lower rent that the law affords him when rates drop. The reverse process is rather uncomplicated and automatic.\n\nThere is more but that's the best-of. The whole mess is the consequence of four decades of 4:3 center-right majorities in national and most local parlaments. That said, in our direct democracy it is perceivable that we will get national votes on some of this soon. These votes take years to set up though.""]"

662,May I rant about capitalism and groceries?,"Y‚Äôall, is it even late-stage capitalism anymore? Is it *end-stage* yet? On life support? (*I hope*. But what comes after?)

When did grocery stores stop selling ingredients?!? I‚Äôm a home cook and it‚Äôs getting increasingly difficult to find the components I need to assemble recipes I‚Äôve been making for years. And I‚Äôm not just talking about more esoteric items like seitan (a gluten-based meat substitute that used to be in pretty much any larger grocery store)\* -- but also really basic stuff like spices that aren‚Äôt Italian seasoning or garlic and onion powder.

I suppose it‚Äôs a chicken and egg question: did people stop cooking because the corporations decided they would no longer carry unprocessed food?\*\* Or did stores stop carrying unprocessed foods because people stopped cooking? I don‚Äôt know the answer.

Whole Foods used to be my go-to, once upon a time (pre-Bezos). But now they might as well call it Processed Foods. I used to get all kinds of dried beans, grains, and international ingredients there. But last time I stopped in (a futile mission born out of desperation), their bulk foods had been completely eliminated, their international section has been reduced to a few sodium-laden Asian labels (that are probably now either produced by or routed through American conglomerates), and some tortillas, taco shells, and a bunch of jars of taco sauce. And their consolation prize is that they now have a little corner shelf with overpriced tiny boxes of a few varieties of dried beans and grains. WTF?!? I went to five different groceries today and still couldn't find all the items on my list.

Is the endgame that they‚Äôre going to force me to eat their frankenfood or starve? Force feed the consumer?

This is not ok.

&#x200B;

\*Going forward, I *will* make it myself. I've done it plenty of times, but sometimes the convenience is... convenient. Gluten can be ordered by mail; seitan has to be refrigerated, so that's a tougher sale.

\*\*Yes, I realize that even flour is a processed food, but there‚Äôs a huge difference between buying flour, yeast, tomato sauce, spices and cheese; versus buying a Totinos frozen pizza.

You use an operating system you trust, on a computer from a manufacturer you trust, across networks you trust, to trade fiat currency in a country you trust, and store that currency in banks that you trust, by signing up with an email service / phone line from a company you trust, to buy or make a transaction with someone who you trust will give you what you paid for.\n\nThis isn\'t even looking at NFTs, where you sign up with an identifiable account linked with your real name to perform anonymous transactions, to get ""ownership"" of goods that are stored off chain on a server you don\'t control.\n\nThe only time crypto was actually doing its job was during the silk road days, where anonymity was important. It STILL wasn\'t 0 trust - you had to trust Silk Road\'s engineers.\n\nIt\'s an interesting mathematical concept that people either mistook for something real, or knew it was fake and hoped to cash out on easy to trick people.\n\n---\n\nAnd of course, the whole thing consumes an absurd amount of power. Because crypto is useless, the energy spent on crypto is wasted.\n\n\n---\nOnto this specific situation - it sounds like they MUST burn, and it\'s in excess to what their grid otherwise requires.\n\nIf THE ENTIRE GRID uses any amount more than what is getting burned for crypto, this whole argument falls apart - you could just use it to power the grid.\n\nIf there IS actually energy surplus, a crypto mining facility is basically the same as a data center. You need a ton of expensive GPU machines, and all the networking and cooling infrastructure that comes with it.\n\nYou may as well have a data center that uses these to train AI models instead, instead of randomly guessing hashes, and actually provde the world a service.\n\nMoreover, when it\'s no longer producing energy surplus, will they just stop? Probably not. Many crypto mining firms contract with the govt to provide a fixed rate for electricity for a LONG timespan (10-20 years), sometimes untaxed, and these facilities usually need a small amount of high skill labor, so they don\'t generally bolster the local economy either.\n\nMore likely than not, this means the mining firms will exceed the energy surplus sometimes in the next several years, and necessitate an increase in production, triggering more fossil fuel emissions.', ""I think crypto has its niches but its not gonna be this big revolution everyone wants it to be, depends on how much coolaid you drink, but you could blame it on the tech itself being money with extra steps or big banks not wanting it to be a thing.

680,The Fox News/Dominion lawsuit is a cautionary tale on the hyper focus of partisan infotainment news that is too common in capitalism.,"News organizations that are private are primarily concerned with generating a profit. All other things are secondary and that includes telling the truth. Fox News is the most extreme mainstream case, but it is hardly alone.

What Roger Ailes was able to do in the de-regulation cesspool of the neoliberal era was truly something remarkable. Evil, but remarkable. Shock jock provocateurs like Rush Limbaugh had already poisoned the radio waves by the early 90s. The removal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 under Ronald Reagan allowed media companies to go wild into partisanship. That mainly benefited the right wing. Beforehand, it was law that media had to present controversial subjects from multiple viewpoints to get a richer understanding of the topic. That was no longer the case.

Roger Ailes was a political animal and a very talented one. He worked on Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984 and was involved in the 1988 George H. W. Bush election.

When Fox News began in 1996, it offered a turn in media that was probably going to happen without Fox, but put it on steroids. Roger Ailes understood cynically that media consumption was becoming siloed. Attempts to appeal to a mass audience were no longer viable and the best path for political power was through targeting the base. From its inception Fox News was never actually news, it was opinion and very aggressive opinion. Their hosts targeted triggers that would keep right wing viewers engaged. Focuses on immigrants flooding the country, black crime in cities, women taking over the workplace, etc. The purpose was to drive profit at all costs by appealing to the worst instincts of conservative voters.

For a long time this model was impenetrable.

During the Obama years, Fox News thrived in coded racism (and sometimes not so coded) to drive viewers. It was a goldmine of right wing victimhood against a Black Democrat president. The conflicts started with Donald Trump.

By 2015, conservative voters had been fed chronic reactionary politics for almost two decades. They had become angry and some of that anger was justified. American standard of living was on the decline and they needed an outlet to express their anger. Previous Republican politicians had danced around this far right politics, but never directly. Donald Trump said all the quiet parts out loud. This was a very good and very bad thing for Fox News.

Never before had they had a Republican politician outright compliment their extremism. The problem was is that now they were no longer the leader. They were the follower. Fox News had to cater to Trump in order to keep the viewers. These extremes became more wild and untethered to reality. The 2020 election aftermath was the peak.

Everyone at Fox News knew the election wasn't stolen. But they weren't in the business of telling the truth. In order to keep their viewers and not lose them to upstart media companies like NewsMax and OAN, they had to lie. Profits had to trump the truth, to use the pun.

What followed and is still going on today is a legal nightmare for Fox News as they peddled outright lies on national television that directly harmed in this case Dominion voting systems. It's a cautionary tale of hyper-capitalism, pursuing profits over everything else.

Broadly speaking, it's not a shock that Fox News and other companies can behave this way in this system. They're rewarded more times than not. Private for profit companies will always behave this way and if they're rewarded enough will push the extremes until they are forced to stop. In the case of news, it means propaganda and lies. Telling an audience what they want to hear so they don't turn away.",117khmg,21,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/117khmg/the_fox_newsdominion_lawsuit_is_a_cautionary_tale/,"['##Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism\n\n This subreddit is for news, discussion, memes, and links criticizing capitalism and advancing viewpoints that challenge liberal capitalist ideology.

719,Hypothesis that billionaires are actually addicted to big numbers getting bigger.,"This idea hit me out of nowhere while I was eating breakfast.

Some of the most popular idle games are the ones in which you watch a number get bigger over time, such as Cookie Clicker, AdVenture Capitalist, Swarm Simulator, Number Go Up, etc. I'm not sure of the exact psychology behind it, but it's a well observed phenomenon in which humans get a dopamine rush from the reward of seeing a number ""improve"" by getting bigger.

We see the same thing on many social media platforms, such as Twitter, Youtube, Twitch, and even here on Reddit, with karma. We also see the reverse, with people's emotional wellness deteriorating when they see their numbers drop or stagnate.

We have observed that not only do people sometimes develop unhealthy obsessions with their numbers, but they have a sort of withdrawal when they're no longer getting that positive stimulus.

Elon Musk, for example, fired some of his employees from Twitter in a rage when they pointed out why his impressions were dropping. 

Many Twitch streamers suffer from poor mental health and depression when their view counts are low, and as a streamer myself, a lot of the advice I get is actually ""don't look at your view count, just do your thing.""

Many Twitter users will outright ignore people with numbers lower than their own, as if they believe they're superior to the person with the lower follow count.

**So, assuming all billionaires are human (and I admit I could be wrong on that) isn't it safe to assume that they're also prone to number addiction?**

I would argue that it's not only possible, but highly likely that the people with the most wealth are aware that they have no need or use for their excess money, but are so addicted to seeing the number go up that if they were to give up their amassed and unreasonable wealth, they would have serious withdrawals that would impact their mental health for a significant period of time.

Simply put, billionaires aren't just greedy. They're literally addicted to their numbers. That's why they don't pay taxes despite having way more money than they need, that's why they go out of their way to keep the wealth that realistically they would have no idea what to spend it on.

I believe that if we can somehow prove this hypothesis, we can convince billionaires that not only will their money not fulfill them emotionally or on any deep level, but that amassing all this wealth to such an obsessive extent is actually a detriment to their mental health, and that they'd be happier with much less.

This might just be the only way to escape the US plutocracy.

If you read this far, I'd like to hear what your thoughts on this are. How likely it is to be accurate, or if there are any tweaks to the hypothesis or sources you'd want to contribute.

Post war, the U.S was flooded with a shit ton of working class people with combat experience.   How do you think they'd have reacted if they haven't won concessions from the elite for fighting through Europe and the Pacific?  You've suddenly got a very angry population with knowledge of how to wage war, and a U.S elite with no one willing to take their side in such a conflict.\n\nSo they allowed a generation or two to have an increased share of the wealth, but in the 1970s  capitalists suddenly realised they could decouple worker pay from production:  Thanks to automation, production efficiency was going through the roof, but because it was largely thanks to automation, the capitalists could claim it was their investment money at risk, so they should get the lion's share of the profits.  Thus began the great wage stagnation that is still ongoing, today.\n\nThe wealth generated by this and globilisation became concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer businesses, and wealthy individuals,  allowing them to make inroads to making bribery legal by getting the right people into legislative positions of power, finalizing the shift to money equating to absolute power with the 2010 Citizens United ruling by the supreme court.   From that point on the super-wealthy owned the U.S political system, able to pick and choose candidates to fund who matched their politics and world view.   Mainly pro-business, anti-consumer, and anti-work force.\n\nWhilst there was some privatization of the U.S Higher Education system before the 1980s, the Reagan era and it's trickle-down theory of economics pretty much guaranteed the boom in for-profit colleges, which exploded in number between then and 2011.  Now to explain why this was bad there's two things that you to know:  First, all student debt is guaranteed by the U.S government, and is some of the safest debt to invest into for any private entity.  Secondly, with the ballooning defense spending, the U.S government has been forced to borrow heavily from private individuals and business entities, in order to keep the house of cards it's built from collapsing in on itself.  So all that safe, guaranteed return on investment debt has been turned into a money generation system, which means student debt will never, ever fully be eliminated, and college courses are never going to come down in price to what they should be - there's too many people with their fingers in the pie for it to be politically acceptable.\n\nSo knowing these facts:\n\n1. Businesses, especially corporations, have the ability to gut laws that threaten their profitability.  Namely laws that are fair for the working class.\n2. Corporations will always attempt to streamline themselves, producing better value for shareholders.  This leads to point 3.\n3. Taking Microsoft's recent round of layoffs as an example:  There are suddenly 11,000 extra people in the unemployment pool, and 11,000 fewer jobs for them to fight for in their field of expertise.  Sure, there are McJobs aplenty, but none of them pay well enough for people whose lifestyle is geared towards higher paying wages.  See points 1 & 2 for the reason why McJobs pay shitty wages.\n4. This is great news for businesses, because they can then play prospective employees off against each other, demanding more of them for lower wages.\n5. It also creates a layer of permanent underclass in the unemployed and the homeless, who can be used as a big, anxiety inducing stick to shake at people and keep them from straying too far out of the bounds of their accepted role.  They also both provide lightening rods for popular anger, allowing people to treat them like second and third class citizens.  In a system like the U.S the abuse of the homeless and the poor is a natural outcome of a hyper-competitive, hyper-capitalistic system, where religion, morality and greed are blended together into a hellish system where one's humanity is a distant smoke stack on the horizon.\n6. And if you have to get more education in order to keep yourself relevant?  Fantastic!  You get to line the pockets of the already super-wealthy when they buy your student debt-based bonds, ensuring the playing field becomes even more uneven.  The super-wealthy don't care - they can afford to attend college without breaking sweet.   The fact that the working class is set against itself over high-education is fucking hilarious to them.  Also, see:  The right vs left, religious values, and the argument over the single payer system.\n7. You cannot rely on your elected representative to reflect your viewpoints.  Money is generally what wins you elections within politics, with the candidate who spends the most generally wins over their rivals -  All that juicy cash buys add space, air time, and articles in newspapers.   A familiar name is a name people will vote for.   So candidates *will* take PAC money, and *will* have to enact the will of the people providing them with that PAC money.

Like sure, it's also a work of shitty, neo-lib propaganda. Like all works in JKs crappy harry potter IP. But it's really not a big deal. Buying it or not buying it isn't going to do much of anything. So you should only invest so much energy into caring. What's more important is the way 'no ethical consumption under capitalism' is being used to defend peoples purchase of the shitty piece of neo-lib toe sucking.\n\n'There is no ethical consumption' under capitalism is not an excuse to mindlessly do whatever you want. What, are you going to go buy a bunch of blood diamonds next? The phrase is about accepting the necessary cruelties you have to participate in to survive your life in the society you were born into, including, on occasion, things that are done purely for relaxation and enjoyment. It's about the food you eat, the cars you drive, and being able to enjoy nice things on occasion without beating yourself up over it.\n\nIt's not about giving yourself the ok to literally go out of you way to take a cultural flash point, and jump on the side of people who are out and stated transphobes. it's not about going out and finding some pro-slavery and anti-semetic narrative in a dogshit IP that has always been full of casual racism, capitalist apologia, neo-liberal simping, and pro-cop sentiment, and then just injecting that shit into your veins without facing any pushback or self-reflection. That's not what this 'no ethical consumption' is there for. It's to let you eat some fuckin chips every now and then, to even play video games at all without feeling guilty. Not for you to willfully, knowingly, and gleefully make the mindless consumer choice.\n\nBut again, not a big deal really. It \\*IS\\* just a video game. I'm sure devs were mistreated, like they always are, but it's not like child slaves did it. However, the reasons this product are shitty weren't exactly obfuscated. Like everyone was pretty much made aware, so if you make the decision regardless, you should expect people who are also aware of the context to make judgements. But then we get to the response to those judgements by all the soft lil toilet paper people acting like someone saying 'I'm disappointed in you, that was lazy and mindless consumerism' is like they just shot someone in the street. Acting like they're getting hatecrimed cause people disapprove of their purchases. As if the couple minutes of discomfort associated with examining your media consumption and purchasing decision is the WORST THING they could possibly imagine. Like bro, it's HEALTHY to feel discomfort like that. That shit is GOOD for you. It won't harm you to THINK about what you do before during and after you do it. Nor will it hurt you to consider WHY people might be upset that you went and made the lazy, selfish choice. It doesn't mean you're evil, or bad forever. Deal with it for a little bit. You're gonna be fine. \n\nSo in the end, my main point is for people upset at push back to just grow up. Play the game if you want. I'd rather you pirate it if you feel like you really need to, but whatever. At the end of the day, it's just a video game. There are more meaningful things going on.

Second, consumer activism doesn't work and if you think it does you're playing the capitalists game and letting them win. This game probably would have been a blip on the radar, moderately popular, something talked about for a week and then forgotten like every other Harry Potter game of all time, but as with every consumer activist boycott not backed by legislation, it has backfired by driving more counter culture engagement driving sales.

750,"Disney and other Hollywood companies will now try to move from producing movies to bussines providing hybrid of social media, streaming platform and game platform.","With the rise of AI powered tools for generating content we could eventually and gradually come closer to generating hollywood quality videos. We could even come close to generate 360 degree VR or AR walkable live action scenes. This may perhaps take 20-30 years.

Old fashioned text media find hard time competing against text generated by users on the internet and social media. Tv news and other Tv content find hard time competing with streaming platforms and user generated content on YouTube and social media as well. The Hollywood was for a long time away from this threat since production of Hollywood quality imagery was still too expensive to be challenged. But with the rise of AI this will gradually change.

Meanwhile we can see that what started as social networks evolved into social medias. Social networks proclaimed to serve for connecting concrete people together, while social media claim to give every single user means to share their ideas and their content with the crowd of users. One of the more recent ones is infamous TikTok providing ability to watch, remix and publish videos in somewhat interactive ways.

We can also see rise of AI powered interactive apps for AI generated content like Dall-e powered apps, FaceApp and so on. There are also Apps for generating music or for generating human voice.

The videogame industry is in similar shape as movie industry, which means in decline, unable to produce any new interesting original content, trying to milk and revival old series etc. In the same time most of today's users are fimiliar with types of games that give players platform and opportunity to create their own games, share them and play them. One example could be Roblox. To lesser degree of freedom also Minecraft. Other attempts at creating games with highly customizable environment and gameplay were also made.

It seems all those trends may to bigger or lesser degree combine.

What I envision is existence of specific kinds of platforms. Platform mostly similar to YouTube and TikTok but with AI powerfull enough to give it's users possibility to create and share Hollywood quality content. But there is more. I suppose it's tool could be highly interactive making the content little bit more similar to remixable and interactive movies and even games with live action style imagery or high quality animation. (This could get even more the case if VR and AR gets into it) That's why I mentioned Roblox in other paragraph. The platform could give people various levels of complexity when it comes to creative tools. There could be like simple interface with just few prompting options and few changes possible but there could also be super advanced interface in style of AI enhanced Blender studios. This platform could use many business models. It could be free to use and sell users data and raise money on advertising. It could offer premium membership but it could also offer something like buying in platforms currency or credit for later being able to make more advanced remixes, editing and for interactive experience basically paying for singular tasks and changes.

I think those kind of platforms might eventually threaten Hollywood companies. Just imagine how it would be popular for the user, to be able to choose development of their own favourite show like game of thrones and basically make other versions of timelines and other versions of series set in similar but slightly tweaked universes or with slightly tweaked characters. Similar to how fanfiction or human mythology functions.

I think Hollywood companies like Disney are aware of this possible trend or they will come to be aware of it soon. The thing is they have the means of production to be able to reaserch and move towards this model. They already use AI in creation of their movies. They already have their streaming services, they are already very active about marketing and about social media, they have their own chanel's and content there as well despite not having any kind of social media platform of their own yet. They also have their own amusement parks and places if they want to build some AI expirience around those. They already try to build cult around themselfs as those who unable dreams and imagination come true. They could easily try to move their production, model and brand towards what I described.

It would be great if we had ability to make this platform public, for people actually owning content created and shared there. But it seems Disney or other company will be the ones doing it.

Meanwhile we may see Hollywood going through painful transformation. Way worse than transition from silent films to movies with audio. The whole studios and infrastructure around could close down. Old movie stars and celebrities will find themselfs out of spotlight while many many other less known people around movies would also need to change job. And those Hollywood companies would resemble more Silicon Valley companies, videogame industry companies with perhaps some kind divisions running bigger and smaller AR enhanced amusement parks and play arenas or play halls in many cities.

It seems to me to be part of the process of developing platform capitalism. Platform capitalism includes stuff like Uber, Bolt, AirBnb, Amazon and Alibaba. The kind of capitalism that monetizes on providing users opportunity to sell services to one another with middle man profiting on all of it.

Now my ideas about future of Hollywood may be very naive. It may be based on false reading of present and on projecting current trends on future. It may connect things to vaguely. Also it may happen that economy crashes or something before we could even get to that point. We can really hardly predict future development. Also we have more important concerns today, then the future of Hollywood but it can be interesting to analyze the trends.

What do you think it will bring to capitalism of that society?",116h6dk,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/116h6dk/disney_and_other_hollywood_companies_will_now_try/,"['##Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism\n\n This subreddit is for news, discussion, memes, and links criticizing capitalism and advancing viewpoints that challenge liberal capitalist ideology.

The suit was brought in PA because of a favorable law, and an argument was made that the court there had a jurisdictional claim because there are train tracks in that state.\n\nThe brief filed by the DOJ is basically siding with the company not because they believe they shouldn\'t pay the guy for his medical expenses and compensate him for being poisoned, but because it would open up a pretty large can of legal worms if a company was beholden to every state\'s laws and regulations in every other state it did business in.\n\nSlide 2 is just fucking false. It keeps getting reposted but people are apparently too dense to understand that FEMA - The Federal Emergency Management Agency - is not allowed to go into an area where no emergency or disaster has been declared. There are plenty of other federal agencies that are responding to this. That is thin.\n\nThird slide is a combination of the idiocy of slide 2 and the anti-ukraine sentiment that is rampant on the right, but I can see where this might be a valid position from a ""this is a waste of money and resources"" point of view. I can\'t accept it as valid in the context of the second slide.\n\n\\#4 is just ""Corporation makes a lot of money and doesn\'t pay the workers or contribute to society"" which is a shallow observation but - hey! - it\'s ACTUALLY anti-capitalist, so good job.\n\nThe fact that most of my engagement with this supposedly far-left sub lately has been to debunk a bunch of lazy far-right shitposts says a lot about the state of this place.

Private and government agencies try to cripple and halt the resistance of the workingclass. They threaten the restricted rights of workers which capitalist democracy allows. Monopoly capitalism‚Äìimperialism ‚Äìcan expand only at the expense of other nations and their peoples and of the workingclass at home.‚Äù\n\n-William F.

791,"It is your own fault you are poor, peasant","Well, remember that money our corporation graciously gave you for your unskilled labor that we really need for some reason?

You spent it all on frivolous things, and that is why you continue to be poor.

You wasted so much on rent instead of owning your own property. I mean, the reality is, we ARE making it impossible for you to even collect enough money for a downpayment OR actually outbid our corporation, but you should have just wasted less money on delivered food.

It is true that we provide food delivery services, and have ads for them all over the internet, including the applications you have on your phone, so you can't really even message your crush without getting an ad for our dine-at-home-for-cheap-but-not-really app.

And even if you fall for our app and you order food, you should know that preparing food at home is cheaper so you could save money that way and we could pay you even less. I mean, it is true that we also overprice groceries making cooking your own meals only a slightly better proposition, so you default to rice and cheap pasta, but think of the savings we could have!

In fact, you would probably save a lot of money if you did not buy overpriced avocados that we import for you to purchase!

But keep in mind that we are not going to take your malnourished body's performance forever. You should be performing at 110% of your capacity at all times! You should buy higher quality food if you are hungry, not spend money on frivolous things, like streaming services.

You should be saving that $10 since that's a life changing amount of money, after all, that's more than we think you are worth per hour! With this money, you could afford to come back to the office to do real work, you could get a galon of gas that we'll sell you.

Just a moment, got another call...

Alright, that was a call from corporate upstream. Apparently, you should forget what I just said. They said our streaming service was on decline as well as our avocado sales, so you'd better resubscribe and go back to eating avocado toast because if you don't, our profits will plummet and our investors will invest in our competitors we didn't even consider we had!

This isn't a product of Japan's strict laws/enforcement of said laws (they have so many skilled farmers, machinists and hobbyists there that growing dank illegal weed and kickass illegal guns/ammo wouldn't be very difficult), it's a product of there being virtually no social demand for weed or guns in Japan to begin with. There's no black market to fill when there's no market demand for something in the first place. \n\nIn the United States however, the social demand for guns is even higher than weed. There's already a rather large boutique black market on illegal machine guns in this nation (you just don't hear much about it because most illegal machine guns sit in the safes/walls of preppers/gun nerds and don't get used in crimes). \n\nCarbon copying most European gun laws onto the U.S. would result in mass non-compliance and would create a massive market demand for illicit arms manufacturers to fill. The result of that would be to either ignore the non-compliance and have the law rendered moot or to have a police apparatus that's more heavily armed than most Western European militaries wage a massive war against the most heavily armed asymmetric armed insurgency in human history i.e. the stupidest fucking idea to the 21st century. \n\nTLDR: Guns are an intrinsic part of a massive swath of U.S. culture and they're not going away. The focus should be on fostering responsibility and a sense of civic duty around firearms ownership while also demilitarizing the police to reduce the perceived need fueling the arms race we are finding ourselves in between the general public and the state. The Czech Republic has far more legal gun owners than they do police, gun owners who own the same types of guns that people in the United States own without having a massive hypermilitarized state security apparatus.

802,This Needs 2 Happen,"It's important not to have an extremists mentality, when it comes to the issue of police. Having an all or nothing mentality, isn't realistic. With America being equally divided between the two major political parties, a nation wide ending of law enforcement, won't happen.

That's why there's only been limited success with defunding. There's not enough people that what to change the system. In the end, the all or nothing mentality, will only hurt the victims of police brutality.

Think of it this way, police body and dash cams, are a far cry from the removal of the policing system but it's been a great aid in capturing police brutality, which actually aids in furthering the cause. That's why, it's important to support legislation that helps deal with these thugs, even if it's not the one everyone wants, it's better than nothing.

Legislation like the one linked below, will help in getting the public to see the criminals for what they are, just like the body and dash cams.

818,Fundamental human rights in a good society...,"Humans have the ability to be competent, introspective, empathetic and intelligent.  As such, the concept of rights should be weighed within a framework that jettisons the idea that they come from somewhere, such as a grant from a divine being.  Instead, we must conclude that our rights can exist simply from the fact that we have the capacity to be reasonable thinkers and decide what is best for ourselves and our collective society.  We don't need to appeal to any authority to legitimatize the existence of our rights other than trusting our own sound minds, reason and logic as competent beings.

As such, consider the following fundamental rights each member of society can be expected to have:

* The right to communication and self expression
* The right to clean water, clean air and ecologically stable planet
* The right to a habitable abode
* The right to good health and health care
* The right to an education
* The right to nutritious food
* The right to clothing
* The right to proper hygiene
* The right to travel and transportation
* The right to employment, occupation, vocation and profession
* The right to vote and participate in the democratic process

Certainly, we can determine that we have other rights, but a good society cannot possibly exist until and unless it ensures these rights above are respected.  Understanding and accepting that these are basic human rights one can weigh their own society against it to as a critique.  As I see it, no nation meets these rights, and each one in the ""first world"" actually fails at providing them, choosing to enrich a few at the cost of the planet and the many.
