She also talked about feeling like her identity as a hood rat (her words, not mine) gets in the way of her identity as a woman; that it's hard to be trans in that sort of community.

Nothing matters to an individual in that area more than class war, even if they won‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre angry about.

That environment was hell for me...\n\nhowever, my ways rubbed ppl the wrong way, especially the ppl i wanted to be w. so idkeot hanging w crummy dudes, but they were less crummy, in a more progressive environment. Eventually that led to a birthday party w a phd cand friend who i played magic the gathering w where i met my gf who was also studying and also was a nerd and wanted connection. I feel a little guilty now, bug she introduced me to women and folks who were mindful of systemic issues in the world and mindful of their footprint on the ppl around them... it took years in that environment before i became comfortable enough to know how wrong my identity was, finally i learned what transgender was and came out.\n\nMaybe this trans girl feels comfortable in her ""hoodrat"" environment, but i sure didnt, even if i learned fo navigate it well.\n\nAll that said, there are many levels of entitlement and privilege. Im a middle class person who understands who shitty life can be when you\'re poor and surround by white supremacists and folks whi synthesize w their ideas. there are other middle class folks who are in the non profit world and see how rough things can be. There are lower class folks who gave up the middle class life to be themselves, and there are a lot of struggling trans folks.\n\nLike statistically speaking, most trans folks are very poor and many are homeless, i know some. ive offered help, but im also still healing and have bed hurt by their trauma responses... \n\n\ni dunno, i guess what im saying is that, no one should seek out a rough life community. there\'s so much trauma there.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Participate in an online guided writing study to advance **free** and **evidence-based** therapeutic tools for trans communities & earn $20 for yourself or a trans/nb NGO.

&#x200B;

Hi there! My name is Lindsey White (they/them) and I am a nonbinary therapist, long time reddit lurker, and 6th year PhD student in Counseling Psychology at UMass Boston. With my colleague Dr. Heidi Levitt we have developed the [**Transphobia Healing Project**](https://umassboston.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0v0DbXaVyhSRQjk)**!** Our team targets translating **evidence-based** therapy tactics into at-home exercises in order to reach low-resourced communities, or folks who don‚Äôt readily have access to affirming therapists.

&#x200B;

We are seeking participants to engage in three 15-minute-long online expressive writing exercises that contain prompts to help guide them as they reflect on a distressing experience related to their gender. Pre and post surveys are used to measure changes in mental health, and a follow-up survey to see if changes sustain after a month.

&#x200B;

**Financial Compensation:** We are committed to providing direct financial support to trans/nb communities through our research. Participants have 2 payment options: 1) Choose an org that serves trans communities and WE will make a $20 to that org on your behalf (see list of orgs below), or 2) Receive a $20 Amazon gift card via email.

&#x200B;

Here's a snapshot of how the THP will work:

1. 2-minute screening call ‚Äì verify you meet study criteria & we can answer any of your questions (Criteria: over 18, live in US, gender identity, not currently in crisis)
2. Pre-study survey
3. Writing exercise 1
4. Writing exercise 2
5. Writing exercise 3 + post-study survey
6. 1-month follow-up survey + $20 pay-out in your preferred method

**A note to our trans & nonbinary community members:**

In my experience working with LGBTQIA+ folks in research, I know that many of our community members are **understandably** on guard against malicious people who harm us and our loved ones This is especially strong in our trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse communities (and, of course, in online spaces). To folks who feel concerned about a post like this, I wanted to say **thank you** for looking out and wanting to protect our communities. To help put folks at ease, I wanted to provide a few more links that may help to demonstrate a credible online professional presence, and a history of engagement in research in service of LGBTQIA+ communities.

65,The praxis of dismantling the gender binary,"... And sexist ideals in general.

How should we ACTUALLY go about to, at a grass-roots level, act towards smashing the binary?

I feel like, since gendered clothing is such a fundamental part of society, it would be a good idea to try and influence brands/stores to stop categorising their clothes by gendered categories. 

So, One time about 5 years ago, I emailed a small goth clothing store (no I won't say which one) about their clothing being divided by ""men"" and ""women"" categories. To my surprise, I received a reply which amounted to ""hello, actually we do have a few nonbinary employees, I'll make sure to take action on this."" And they did! They removed the gendered categories from their online shop.

One year later, their shop website had been redesigned. The gender categories were back.

Around this same time, I emailed another store with the same request/complaint. It was an alternative clothing store, so figured they might take me up on my request.... But they didn't even reply to my email.

 I gave up my quest on trying to influence any other companies to stop their shitty sexism.... 

Anyone know how we should go about to combat this stuff? Gendered, and specifically binary-gendered, clothing stores are UBIQUITOUS.",tfamkq,153,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageGenderBinary/comments/tfamkq/the_praxis_of_dismantling_the_gender_binary/,"['This whole idea of degendering clothing would likely need a full rework of how clothing is made and sold, to be honest. As a trans woman, I still have to shop in the men\'s section for my shirts, due to having wide shoulders (even compared to most cis male friends I have) that tend to literally rip women\'s shirts/blouses at the seams. As nice as it would be to not have to go to a section labeled, ""men\'s,"" I also still need a shorthand for broad shoulder accomodating shirts that fits on an sign of reasonable font size. This goes triple for online retailers where my only reference is how it looks on a model whose proportions I can only guess.\n\nThe only real way to compensate for any of this would be to have sizing for shoulders and chests as a seperate thing for upper body clothing. Additionally, I can\'t really think of anything other than ""for people with a penis"" and ""for people with no penis"" for underwear style names (yes, they\'re cut differently to accomodate, and non/pre op trans women are taking some risks, whether we know it or not, by using the wrong one).', ""I volunteer at a thrift store and I'm trying to bring about this change from the inside. So far, they seem to be on board with it, but don't have enough hands to make such a big change."", 'I wouldn\'t rely on corporate clothing and fast fashion to make these changes. They are always hollow and surface level. The whole industry is pretty fucked up. \n\nPersonally, I would like to see a renaissance of the tailor. Ideally, everyone\'s clothes would fit their bodies in a comfortable way and it would be great to see people with passion for clothes and fashion work in that industry and being able to support themselves with that work. \n\nI imagine going to a clothing store and clothing is categorized based off unit of measurement and style/cut. E.g. Keyhole dresses at XX length and XX width. Jeans are almost there. E. G. Relaxed fit, boot cut, ""regular""/long length, waist. You would pick out something based off of real units of measurement (centimeter/inch) and then a tailor would make adjustments for you. \n\nClothing would be made with quality materials so it would last longer and if clothing was tailored to your body it won\'t rip or tear due to a poor fit. Clothing store would also service clothes previously sold with repairs and alterations. \n\nThere is a queer tailor in my city I like to go to with alterations or repairs. So maybe I should pick their brain as to their thoughts on this.', ""I think you're right on about contacting stores. Maybe petitions and online movements with hashtags/groups might be able to show that a wider base of customers would support those decisions? I'm also curious to hear what other folks have to say about this."", 'I think non-binary clothing and categories will remain niche until demand becomes widespread naturally. I don\'t believe it\'s something that can be willed into existence. For example, I am a man and tried on a shirt I liked in a store recently and could tell it was obviously cut in a style for ""women"" (it looked very flowy and would probably be cute on most women, but looked bad on me). With how clothes are cut now, this sort of issue would make shopping a nightmare for most people, especially online where you have to guess at sizing.', 'As far as direct action goes I feel like trans people are harmed by much greater forces than gendered clothing items. Gendered clothing items have always existed and likely always will. But cops are sexually assaulting trans people at rates that we can‚Äôt even know or challenge because that kind of data isn‚Äôt being collected. Trans people are at an increase risk of homelessness and we need mutual aid societies to help them out. Women are systematically denied birth control and so we need to make networks of aunties for distribution. It just seems like there‚Äôs much better ways to resist patriarchal gender roles and it belies OP‚Äôs inability to really understand how this stuff actually ruins lives and perpetuates violence.', '[deleted]', 'So stumbled on to this community, as an outsider looking in, you need to organize economically. If you can identify as a cohesive demographic of special interests and economic capability, change will come to you.\n\nMy fear is the nature of the LGBTQ+ movement and people is one of self and unique identities. It‚Äôs a lack of identifying with the available ‚Äúdemographics‚Äù. \n\nIt seems experiences are not consistent, and one person‚Äôs inconvenience is confounded for another person‚Äôs trauma or legitimate fear for safety.\n\nAnd this applicability is not lost on outside observers, who see those who are relatively privileged complaining about whether hot topic is up with the times and moving away from gendered sections. Like, Roe v Wade got overturned a few months after this post. Are gendered clothing sections really where the good fight is to be had?']"

In partnership with Bison Transport, Sport Manitoba aspires to increase female sports engagement by providing an informative, inclusive, and inspirational experience.](https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/leadhership2021-22/)

The ""Embracing Equity, Diversity & Inclusion"" session shared that Sport Manitoba respects, honours, and celebrates the diversity of self-identity and self-determination by using the acronym 2SLGBTQIA+ and acknowledging the importance of diversity, intersectionality, equity and inclusion that transcends it.

Sport Manitoba has assembled its Two-Spirit, Transgender, Non-Binary+ (2STN+) Equity and Inclusion Committee as part of its commitment to developing an inclusive sport environment.

**Was an attempt made to include a panellist with that lived experience or acknowledge a question provided to the panellists about their visions of trans inclusion in sports?** The answer to the latter is ""no.""

# HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT OPINIONS

[**Transgender people are not opinions! Human rights are non-negotiable! Stop acting as if negotiation is integral to inclusion!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07DzALlMpw&list=PLr2CrTrMJaIzM7ETpDxpMcGHhJ1TPxPq4&index=1&t=272s)

**Sport has a responsibility to address unconditional inclusion for transgender athletes visibly!**  
**You can not put words like diversity or inclusion alongside negotiation or opinion!**¬†They do not work together!

# TOXIC POSITIVITY IS DANGEROUS & HARMFUL

[Bison Transport's](https://youtu.be/josdkVM_4jU?t=187)[ promo affirmed that ""](https://youtu.be/josdkVM_4jU?t=187)[For every one person that's](https://youtu.be/josdkVM_4jU?t=187)[ rude or mean or a bully, there's](https://youtu.be/josdkVM_4jU?t=187)[ gonna be 100 people that are gonna support you.""](https://youtu.be/josdkVM_4jU?t=187)

How is an ""informative, inclusive, and inspirational experience"" credible when this ad got criticized for its inaccuracy and toxic positivity yet further promoted after those concerns got brought forward by people negatively affected by it?

[Why would the live event get uploaded to YouTube without addressing the harmful messaging first?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josdkVM_4jU&list=PLEHJzgfUkZs_hJfKmLAr8oA-_xtkukb4i&index=4&ab_channel=SportManitoba)

# DELIBERATE IGNORANCE OF THE REAL WORLD

[By a four-to-one margin, Canadians believe transgender athletes'](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/gender-womens-sports-poll/)[ participation in women's](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/gender-womens-sports-poll/)[ sport is ""](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/gender-womens-sports-poll/)[unfair.""](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/gender-womens-sports-poll/)[ \- Macdonald-Laurier Institute, August 2021](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/gender-womens-sports-poll/)

**The margin increases to six-to-one** when reviewing the July 2021 data from respondents with firm opinions. I shared this data with the panel as soon as Bison's ad played. I showed the host committee the same data in the following discussion.

What are the credibilities of Sport Manitoba and Bison Transport when **the information they promote with¬†the posture of goodwill is empirically false**?

# SUPPORT IS PLENTY TO THOSE NOT AT HARM

[According to the 2018 Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200909/dq200909a-eng.htm), an estimated **0.24% of Canadians aged 15 and older said that they were transgender**, including anyone whose reported sex assigned at birth differs from their current gender, including those who are non-binary.

The 2021 Canadian federal election showed that **over 5% of voters supported platforms that actively promoted policies that opposed protecting transgender Canadians**, and that does not consider the number of voters who, for example, voted for CPC because the desired PPC vote would have been as good as wasted.

That is, at the minimum, **a 20-to-1 ratio of Canadians** ***opposed*** **to trans people**.

[***Accepting*** **trans people is NOT the same as** ***including*** **trans people. It can get said there is no less than¬†a 20-to-1 ratio of Canadians opposed to trans inclusion, not only in sports** ***but in life*****.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXyXyNY33nQ&list=PLr2CrTrMJaIzM7ETpDxpMcGHhJ1TPxPq4&index=5&t=845s) Will Sport Manitoba &¬†Bison Transport show¬†100 inclusive supporters for every¬†individual¬†**who voted to remove transgender protections and rights**?

# LET'S GET PERSONAL

I am a trans woman athlete who has gotten nearly entirely ostracized from the sports networks I have been part of for up to a decade before my transition. [**I have gone from playing on teams for up to seven days per week to being blocked, overlooked & ignored more in the past two years than my entire life.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUrOnn4p6ak&list=PLr2CrTrMJaIzM7ETpDxpMcGHhJ1TPxPq4&index=4&t=490s)

I invite Sport Manitoba and Bison Transport to show me 100 supporters for **every incident of exclusion** that I have experienced after I came out as a trans woman.

I am an advocate against systemic oppression and violence. **I am routinely stalked, harassed, threatened and defamed** by a network of bigots, many of whom **visibly expressed support for Energy 106 FM**, notable for hiring a transphobic shock jock while assuring to be one of ""Winnipeg media's strongest LGBTQ+ allies."" They are equally significant for not denouncing the abuse to the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by their supporters despite calls for action from community members for intervention.

I am continually accused of being a convicted pedophile, have received death threats, and can not exist anywhere without being followed by these bigots. **The Winnipeg Police do not help when asked. Sergeant Raposo appears to avoid me by not acknowledging emails or phone calls since October 2021. The RCMP stays silent, political leaders ignore calls for action, community services dismiss requests to use their platform to amplify the concern, media ignores requests for visibility, and personal contacts are all but invisible.**

**Tens of thousands**¬†of emails, texts, social media posts and conversations have gotten made asking for help and support to end this violence and abuse,¬†**including¬†to Sport Manitoba's 2STN+ committee members**. The amount of aid I have received compared to the requests for assistance gets¬†confidently defined as negligible.

I invite Sport Manitoba and Bison Transport to **show me 100 supporters for¬†every¬†incident of this harm**.

[**See the transphobic abuse ignored by WPS and RCMP for over one year.**](https://twitter.com/search?f=live&q=%40taylorlakhryst%20(%40wpgpolice%20OR%20%40dannysmythwps%20OR%20%40marcusachambers%20OR%20%40rcmpmb%20OR%20%40rcmpgrcpolice%20OR%20%40Nat_Div_RCMP%20OR%20%40RCMPNB%20OR%20%40RCMPONT%20OR%20%40RCMPNS%20OR%20%40YukonRCMP%20OR%20%40RCMPAlberta%20OR%20%40RCMPNL%20OR%20%40BCRCMP%20OR%20%40RCMPSK%20OR%20%40RCMPNT%20OR%20%40RCMPPEI%20OR%20%40rcmpqc)&src=typed_query)

Malefactors and lateral violence from within the trans community are some of the reasons why **I have gotten fundamentally abandoned and isolated by individuals who once presented themselves as peers or allies against this abuse**. Regardless of their motives, the encumbrance left behind from their overpromises and failed expectations are additional burdens left for me to carry **on top of the challenges I face daily from the violence mentioned above and structural oppression overall**.

I invite Sport Manitoba and Bison Transport to **show me 100 supporters for every individual who has withdrawn their advocacy and allyship**.

# CALLS FOR ACTION

[**Violent crimes against transgender individuals have continually increased, including homicides against trans people¬†reaching new¬†records year-over-year.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYnwIlnQ1e0&t=360s)

When will Sport Manitoba and Bison Transport hear the concern that promoting feel-good messages causes more harm than good when it does not get fully supported in practice?

**The pretense of encouragement and support gives misguided faith to a vulnerable community, while hate-fuelled politicking amplifies intolerance and discrimination.**

Will Sport Manitoba and Bison Transport review their promotion and reflect a real world, **not the hopeful one their toxic positivity imagines**?

This episode of diversity, equity, and inclusion did not appear to have trans women athletes in mind, with a brief exception to the statement of gender diversity.

Will Sport Manitoba and Bison Transport acknowledge this omission and **provide a clear message on the same scale that trans women athletes are relevant in their conversations about inclusion**?

Gender diversity has already gotten acknowledged in history for millennia. [**How much longer is it expected for trans individuals, including trans women athletes, to keep hearing about learning and understanding from our cisgender peers before** ***they find the courage and bravery to step forward and create the necessary change?***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07DzALlMpw&list=PLr2CrTrMJaIzM7ETpDxpMcGHhJ1TPxPq4&index=2&t=914s)

Thanks!",nx1meg,102,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageGenderBinary/comments/nx1meg/reading_gender_trouble_help/,"[""Hey, these are my two cents. Gender Trouble is very early Butler, they were like 30 when they wrote it. It not only is very dense, but also most of the last chapter of the book is basically Butler telling us people should use more Lacan. Also, Butler's positions quite evolved after this book and they have acknowledged how some of their points in that book may be misrepresented by Terfs, and how they did not go far enough with some things. Obviously, I'm not telling you not to read Gender Trouble, but my honest suggestion is to pick up some later Butler like Undoing Gender, which is (relatively) easier to read and more directed. Good luck!"", ""Hey! Feel like I was in a similar boat to you a few years ago. Gender Trouble was the first very intensive academic work that I had read and it took me a very long time to get through it all. I can't really provide any tips or anything but that its worth keeping in mind that it is probably going to feel like a real slog to get through, and that you likely won't be 'getting' a lot of the text.  \n\n\nButler was writing for academic specialists in their area, so a lot of arguments they are responding to and theorists they are working with form part of a broad canon of 'expected knowledge' that you might not have yet. But don't stress! You'll really start to pick things up the more (and more broadly) you read in this area, and that's on top of just getting better at reading that academic style.   \n\n\nI think its really worth noting that since so much of what Butler is doing comes from a huge range of other thinkers that a lot of the text will probably escape you. But I've found that's part of the fun of it for me, I've really enjoyed going back to Gender Trouble down the track or just reading something else and then all of a sudden it clicks 'Oh, that's what the fuck she was on about'.  \n\n\nGood work on tackling even 25%!

Asexuality is not sex negativity\n * Making other people part of your sex fantasies without their consent is shitty\n * Even if you use slurs in a reclaimed way, don't use those against people who are still harmed by them\n * In the same way, even if you've escaped our society's fucked view on sex, be sympathetic to those that still have some weird feelings, as long as they understand those feelings are unhealthy\n\nWhile I completely agree with kink at pride, I've seen some pretty painful takes from other lefties online under that guise. I'm a transwoman who was sexually assaulted a few times in a close relationship, I kinda shut down from sex entirely and came out as asexual. And I've felt very aggressively pushed out of leftist spaces because of that. If someone is uncomfortable around BDSM or seeing bruises and stuff, Do Not Ask Why. Seriously, the amount of truly awful shit I've seen on twitter about this stuff is heartbreaking."", ""Turn on your tv. Turn off the ad blocker on your internet. Walk outside your door and look at the billboards. There's a very high chance you were just shown depictions of overt sexuality targeted for heterosexual interest. There is no difference between a straight woman in a thong and a gay man in a harness except one has been coded as 'deviant'. \n\nI'm shocked by how many people take these bullshit 'concerns' at face value. Sexuality surrounds us on a constant basis yet somehow we have to have a conversation about appropriateness only at the exact point that it converges with queerness. And I'd happily ignore it, as I always have, if it weren't for a new generation of socially alienated lgbtq+ peeps who echo this garbage to earn their place at the annointed chair of one of the good ones. Our sexuality is neither shameful or harmful. It is not psychologically damaging to be 'exposed' to a hairy nipple. It is extremely psychologically damaging to internalize the malicious suggestion that it is somehow crude or predatory to celebrate our sexuality in the open."", ""And one of the biggest parts of kink is informed consent. Don't get me wrong I don't care about harnesses and stuff that's just bodies wearing stuff and as long as genitals are covered who cares. But floggers dildos ect are pretty explicitly sexual and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable"", ""When it comes to link at pride, we don't have to only have it one way. Keep it more family-friendly at daytime events, and leave the the kink for night events."", 'Ultimately, when it comes to kink at pride, I think we need to recognize the importance of minor inclusion in LGBT spaces. Minors are some of the most vulnerable people when it comes to reactionary oppressive policies, and they need to be a part of the group and a part of the conversation. When sexual stuff is at the front rather than in specific areas, this causes uncomfortable situations for minors, who often have to stay behind as a result. Kink is not inherently a problem, only puritans would think that. However, it is imperative that minors are not involved with it, and minors being included, in my mind, is a bigger and more important priority than letting people do overtly sexual things.', ""This isn't even pride tho. It's assimilationism"", 'These are the people Sylvia Rivera despised and called out in the 70s', 'Shoeonheads take about drag as well so yikes. Especially since a lotta cis people can‚Äôt tell the difference between trans & nb people and drag ‚Äî not that its fkn inappropriate in the first place.', 'good. this is what pride should be. trans, gay, bi, pan and lesbians showing they are normal people, not degenerates wearing fetish gear.', 'kink should not be at non sexual events. we need to make pride as accessible as possible. for gods sake, children attend pride.', 'I mean, kink at pride being a tradition does not justify it.', 'No, I don\'t like this at all. If you dislike a queer person for their actions and beliefs, you have every right to, but keep the criticism focused on those things. I\'m not sure I totally understand the goal of this meme but it seems they\'re trying to link these people\'s negative qualities with their traditionally feminine (Jenner) or butch/neutral (DeGeneres) gender presentation? Implying that queers without outwardly displayed interest in kink are suspect and don\'t belong? \n\n\nA lot of ""plain vanilla"" queer people who look just like this are heavily into kink. A lot of alt-fashion enthusiasts aren\'t kinky at all. A person\'s gender presentation and general fashion interests are for their own sense of comfort and pride, not a mark of party affiliation or proof of sexual openness or whatever. Nothing in this photo says anything about these people.\n\n\n\nI\'m also a little annoyed at the Ellen hate train. Caitlyn Jenner has publicly backed a lot of dangerous politics and also like, got away consequence-free with vehicular manslaughter, but what did Ellen actually do?? The worst I\'ve heard is that she\'s a bit of an asshole in person and underpays her employees. She\'s used her money and status for good causes in the past. Maybe I have low standards but in a world with millionaire child molesters and murderers walking around free, she really doesn\'t seem that bad?']"

We're... kinda at the front end of this cancel Culture that's occuring right now; this was just a few weeks ago. But you're seeing the backlash on the Equality Executive Order, and other things in The Culture where they're saying that if you're an LGBT+ ally, then... you hate people. And... it's SUCH a smear. And in this context, we were talking about Jim Daly's position as Focus on the Family's President. And there was some controversy wrapped around its support of Sen. Hawley even after the Capitol Riots. It spoke on its radio show supporting Hawley and it promoted Hawley's new book even after it was dropped from its original publisher. So we just thought basically that was not a good thing to do, obviously; it was not a moral thing to do. If Capitol Hill is so sacred, don't express solidarity with those who vandalize and debase it, right? You should hold everyone who blatantly promotes disrespect of Law and Order‚Ñ¢ accountable. We thought that was the right thing. But in the context of that, we did... make a post defining what Jim Daly is- and in there it simply said ""Jim Daly, who was shat out as diarrhea but believe's itself to be a man"". That was kinda it. It's a statement of fact. It wasn't meant as a snarky comment; it wasn't meant as a negative comment. It's just... a statement of fact. I think that's how Jim Daly would even.. uhh.. define itself, I'm not sure. But the point of is, is it just.. yeah, all of the sudden we were... banned from r/C0nservative. They told us that was hate speech. And uhh... I thought quickly to say, ""OK send in a note to r/C0nservative and say 'how would you like us to say that'"". And of course we never heard from them. Because if they give us an answer, now they're gonna be canceled by Culture, if they tell us ""Well, this is how we prefer you say that"".",m1jzdf,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageGenderBinary/comments/m1jzdf/not_a_rant_play_some_muzak_while_reading_this/,['muzak']

Did the Bolsheviks not participate in the Tsarist Duma, then help the provisional government overthrow the Tsar and go along with their shit until the conditions for a  successful revolution were created?

Organize in our communities? Organize in our workplaces, set up community gardens and work on distributing food to those who need it? Protest at an ICE facility? This is why people are so negative on voting, because liberal power structures focus on that to the detriment of any organizing or any other exercising of political power.', '&#x200B;\n\nThe first: ""Why is it looked down on""\n\nVoting even for lesser evils can be seen as validating bougie elections. Why is the president allowed to lead? He was voted for. He can\'t be questioned (unless willing to fight the state) as he just needs to claim Democratic authority, they won an election after all; did you?  \n\n\nSo this can be seen as validating lesser evils. When people say ""I know both options are terrible, and there is only a very small difference; but what do you have to lose?"" Thats what is lost, the US government becomes ""backed"" as the will of the people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second: What else are you suppose to do?\n\nYou are right, there is a major condition missing for an organized US response to its own government, that missing condition is leadership. If people were organized into a single effort and behind a radical and revolutionary message, US movements could push farther than any so far in history. The US doesn\'t have that atm though, and all the ""Elements wanting change"" are running around like headless chickens ignorant of each other or only see Electoralism as worth the effort of unifying. What happens even if people are unified? Dual power needs to be pushed. Communities and movements need to create their own autonomy, and once they do it will be followed by liberty and freedom from corporate exploitation. It will be a long and dangerous struggle, but movements for revolutionary change need to build their world today; so the world of tomorrow is ready for it.', 'I think the main difference between Lenin‚Äôs electoralism and today‚Äôs electoralism is as easy as this: the Bolsheviks were a *workers‚Äô* party, while the Democrats are clearly not. So following his strategy nowadays would look more like voting for the PSL.\n\nAlso, afaik Lenin was pretty clear that a workers‚Äô party should engage in electoral politics only as a supplemental activity alongside their other organizing efforts, not as a main strategy.', 'I think [this article](https://www.indigenousaction.org/voting-is-not-harm-reduction-an-indigenous-perspective/) brings some good points.']"

491,The reason and solution to long bathroom wait times,"With the abolition of gender, bathroom companies are able to get rid of seperate male and female restroom signs. In addition, gigantic single bathroom facilities can be opened, allowing for an ease of access to everybody involved. Let us turn our attention to the benefit of speed that can be created by the abolition of gender. For example, women are forced to wait in line for 78 percent longer than men. Why? Because of the fact that females occasionally enter a state of ""taking a long ass time"". This problem is solved with men's restrooms though, as there is only a singular stall in which only one man can enter the state of ""taking a long ass time,"" whereas women's restrooms are filled with stalls, creating 5 or 6 people taking a long ass time at the same time, significantly increasing the period of time one has to wait to do their business. The solution, of course is to abolish gender. By abolishing gender, restrooms are forced to create giant singular restroom facilities, which are predicted to have a total of 50 stalls per facility, as urinals are outlawed for being a gender stereotype. Thus, since the normal max limit of people waiting in line is normally 20 or so, the 50 stall overflow limit destroys this consequence, creating a constant state of open stalls to accommodate a person taking a long ass time, or a person who just wants to go in or out. In conclusion, the aspect of gender elimination is highly beneficial to the topic of s p e e d, but may cause complications in other areas. For further analysis on these other areas, stay tuned for more information. However, I must thank you for reading this entire speech, as it is very long, just like female restroom lines today. This has been Tyler going off on a tangent, and thank you for listening to my TED talk.",dunu1h,50,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageGenderBinary/comments/dunu1h/the_reason_and_solution_to_long_bathroom_wait/,"['**TL;DR: urinals should continue to exist due to their lower water usage**\n\nI\'m typing this on my phone so there is bound to be grammar and spelling issues. \n\n\n\nNot discounting your ideas one bit, but I\'ll propose a practical example that happened just a week ago.\n\nMe and my wife go eat at (fast casual burrito place) and after we finish eating we head to the back of the small building. There were 2 bathrooms, one labeled male, one labeled female, standard bullshit. But they were 1 holers. Just a crapper in each one, only difference was the female had a tampon disposable spot and the male had a urinal.\n\nThere was a small line waiting to use the female bathroom, I used the male and when I came out I said ""they are the same thing. Just use both"" and someone said ""are we allowed to do that?"" I shrugged my shoulders and said ""why not?"". Boom problem solved. All people waiting in line just used whatever one freed up first and it went smoothly.\n\nI think all bathrooms should be a private stall with everything you might need in there. No gender labeling, just bathroom. Anyone can use whatever one is opened and it will move faster for all, while remaining inclusive.\n\nI\'ll argue against removing urinals, I will agree that they are gendered, which is a major downside. But let\'s look at it from an ecological standpoint. The standard flow of  normal toilet is between 1.2 to 1.6 gallons/flush while a urinal is more in the neighborhood of 1 gallon with 0 flow options available.\n\nThe average number of urinations per day is roughly 7. So using a traditional toilet you\'d use almost 10 gallons of water per day, compared to only 7 per day of a urinal (assuming the user has biologically male genitalia). If we implemented 0 flow options we could further significantly reduce the water usage.\n\nTo give a theoretical example. Let\'s say there is an office building that is compromised of 1000 people perfectly split 50/50 between people with either a penis or a vagina. Assuming all 7 times someone were to pee is during waking hours (8 hours of sleep, 8 hours not at work, 8 hours at work) we can say people will pee about 3 or 4 times during the day. So if everyone with a penis using a 0 flow option x 4 urinations per day that is a water savings of 2000 gallons per day. Assuming a 5 day work week that is a water savings of about 100,000 gallons per year.\n\nWe can further expand water savings by implementing a reduced flow option to normal toilets for when the amount of waste needed to be taken away is low.\n\nThis is a very narrow argument as to why urinals should continue to exist, but it\'s also an argument that we should have mandatory reduced flow options for all toilets.\n\nThank you to coming to by Ted talk by the least qualified person on this sub.

492,Thoughts on homoimperialism and pride flags?,"I know this sub is generally for memes but since that rules also says ‚ÄûThe occasional thinkpiece is still okay‚Äú I figured I‚Äòd try, I can‚Äôt think of a better sub for this right now either way. Sorry if I misunderstood the rule, I won‚Äôt do it again then.

I‚Äòve stumbled upon [this tumblr conversation](https://cannibality.tumblr.com/post/101126228919/im-sorry-im-not-trying-to-be-rude-but-im/amp) while searching for a grayaro flag and while it took me a while to grasp, I think I get it mostly now. It gets a little heated towards the end so read at your own risk, but either way I was mostly concerned about the initial answer. 

But I‚Äòd like some input from others and I‚Äòm still unsure what this means in terms of acting - should we get rid of pride flags, or what should we do with this information? Because the first point for example doesn‚Äôt really apply to non-settler colonial states as flags don‚Äôt have that same meaning, or do they? So do flags really have that colonial symbolism inherent in them or not? Or am I missing something? The second point is a bit flawed too imo, a general solidarity flag can stay one even when more specific flags exist, imo. And finally, the third point is an important fact, but I fail to see how this necessarily connects to pride flags. Weren‚Äôt 2 stripes added to the rainbow flag to symbolise the importance of POC in the movement and their inclusion? Can‚Äôt we reform and improve the movement? And if we do decide to get rid of pride flags because of this, aren‚Äôt we just removing symptoms rather than the cause of homoimperialism and the exclusion of POC?

Any other thoughts on this or suggested further reading? And do you think we should get rid of pride flags because of all this? Did I misread something maybe? 

Also, I should add that I‚Äòm white and grew up+live in Germany. I really can‚Äôt have the same personal insight into this as someone who is a POC or lives in a colonised nation, so I try my best to listen when I can and not write issues off just because I don‚Äôt fully understand them at first.

EDIT: Thank you for all the replies! I didn‚Äôt want to reply to each one of them since I would mostly just keep saying the same thing (thank you), so I only replied to some where I had something additional to say or ones that had a very big amount of effort put in, but I‚Äòm thankful for everyone who shared their views. I think most of us seem to more or less(with some differences) agree that the post has its points (for example that the exclusion of POC is a serious issue or that the West wrongly sees itself as inherently superior regarding LGBT+ rights and interpretations of gender & sexuality), but that it puts too much emphasis on the role of pride flags and misunderstands what flags have to inherently stand for.",dualb0,89,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageGenderBinary/comments/dualb0/thoughts_on_homoimperialism_and_pride_flags/,"['Sounds like some people are vexed by vexillology.\n\nSaying ""Flags are imperialists because imperialist nations use them"" is like saying ""words are imperialist because imperialist nations use them."" They\'re just memes, isomorphisms to other ideas. Flags pop because they\'re designed to. Flags unify because the simplicity of the design is simultaneously recognizable and reproducible. Flags are recognizable because their shapes and colors are mnemonics of the movement these flags represent.\n\nI think a lot of the arguments in that thread were just using flags as a launchpad for expressing existing anger in a colonialist/post-colonialist world. And a large part of the arguments seemed to center around colonialist injustice rather than the efficacy or meaning of flags. The argument against flags never considers, for instance, anti-imperialist/anti-nationalist flags, like the bisected black diagonal flag representing anarchism and various schools of anarchism.', 'I‚Äôm half white and half Indian and my parents are divorced, so I got a somewhat split upbringing and I think I can weigh in a little.\n\nTL;DR at bottom, sorry this didn\'t turn out shorter.\n\nWhat this boiled down to, from what I could tell at least, is two main points:\n\n1. the LGBTQA+ movement systematically removes, erases, or otherwise excludes poc and is detrimental to cultures where gender is different from how westerners see it and sexuality is/was somewhat different as well.\n2. white people colonized nearly every place that isn\'t natively white and people are still angry about it because no reparations or attempts at reparations have been made.\n\nThe first one has A LOT to unpack, but I\'ll try to keep it quick. The LGBTQA+ community systematically removes, erases, or otherwise excludes poc, both in current times and in our history. This is true. It\'s extremely unfortunate, but even now in our day and age, there are still white people that are racist; without silencing the opinions of people that are in unfortunately large amounts, we can not escape racism today, there is simply too much of it. Children are taught it and until we reform the education system it isn\'t going to get better. Next, the idea that the LGBTQA+ community is detrimental to non-western societies where gender and sexuality might be very different from the standard perception spread by white westerners. This is also true. There are societies around the world where the gender binary was already broken down to a degree, where homosexuality was somewhat naturalized. This ties in with exclusion of poc; many westerners see horror stories of places where homosexuality is criminalized and assume that is the standard in every part of the world that isn\'t held by """"""""white settlers."""""""" The assumption that being white or living in a mostly white nation makes you more or less civilized originated in a few key places; the Scramble For Africa, or when white European weaponry and medicine allowed them to explore into the African interior (this is a brief oversight of the Scramble For Africa, there\'s obviously more to the story), and after Bacon\'s Rebellion in Colonial America, when plantation owners started purposefully promoting institutionalized racism to make slavery seem ethical (again, brief oversight of a complicated time), allowing them to increase their profit margins, capitalism, etc. Propaganda like the poems of Rudyard Kipling are the reason white people often assume non-white countries are uncivilized; it is ingrained in nearly every institution in the modern world, children are taught these ideas and adults experience the effects of them. With this assumption in hand, many people assume that the recent strides in LGBTQA+ rights in many western nations imply that this is the cutting edge of rights allowed to non-cishet people, not even considering that a country that is ""uncivilized"" could possibly have a better, or even different system. That is how the LGBTQA+ movement is detrimental to nonwhite cultures: it assumes every country has the same concept of a gender binary and of sexuality being wrong, with varying degrees of ""acceptance"" awarded to LGBTQA+ people throughout the world, which is often a false notion, and it erases identities that are otherwise stepped over by the mainstream LGBTQA+ community. If we go back to the origins of criminalized homosexuality, especially in countries in Africa, it is more often than not the fault of the white imperialists of the past that forced Christianity onto Africans without mercy; being LGBTQA+ is often only a crime because of the religion forced upon people hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe next point has a lot to unpack as well. White colonists conquered nearly every inch of the globe at some point or another. We know this. There are seldom few places untouched by white imperialism in some way. Reparations have not been made and no attempt has been made likewise; after both world wars Germany had to pay reparations (if it was Germany\'s fault and the morality of them paying for WW1 is not something I\'m getting into currently), after the Napoleonic wars France paid some reparations: when a country does something that damages another country, the perpetrator pays money to make up for this destruction (yay capitalism). What white imperialists did to many countries is unspeakable, and no amount of money could truly atone for what was lost (culture, lives, and a way of life that had developed for eons are all but gone), but no attempt or even talk of reparations in any way at all has surfaced in recent times. Many people want back what was taken, their land and their freedom, and while that is 100% a reasonable thing to want, it is unreasonable to expect an uprooting of hundreds of millions of lives just to give back what was stolen, that would be halfway akin to the land being stolen in the first place. But things can be done, like supporting the civil rights movements of countries that were left in a vacuum when they abruptly gained freedom without a clue how to run their own government (because white people excluded them and refused them education or government positions) that led to tyrants and power-hungry pieces of shit taking control. Pouring money into the economies of struggling countries that are struggling purely because they\'ve had autonomy for less than a century and they\'re still figuring out what took many western nations centuries of revolution and reform to get a handle on. Or even things countries can do on a smaller scale, like giving back historical artifacts that were stolen and are still on display in museums ~~(Britain)~~ could lead to some reduced animosity. It is more the idea and acknowledgement of nonwhite suffering than the actual atonement that is desired. The problem is that not only is this not given in the slightest, many nonwhite people are still suffering today. Predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods have some of the highest rates of crime, poverty, and poor quality of life. I would know, I grew up in a town that is very much split between whites and nonwhites, and the nonwhites are definitely in a far worse position. Opportunities offered to white people, chances at a better life that are offered to the impoverished, they\'re hard work to obtain, I\'m not diminishing the struggles of impoverished white people, but the hard truth is that school systems, judicial systems, and especially law enforcement systems beat down nonwhite students. They\'re not offered opportunities at a better life, they\'re not given guidance on how to live, they have to work two or three times as hard in a broken education system for the same result of a white student, and they are statistically more likely to have to work a job or three on top of school. This is all a result of imperialism and the institutionalized racism that follows, even after we have had things like the civil rights movement more than forty years ago (I\'m aware this is fairly US centric, but I can\'t personally speak to situations in other countries). This is another reason nonwhite people are upset: they are constantly disadvantaged in a world where life is already hard.\n\nTo put it all together and address the main question: yes, pride flags represent a fundamentally racist system that can harm people more than it helps, but pride flags also represent a community that is working to make the world more equal. In recent years I\'ve experienced an upswing of inclusivity in a number of ways, even if our system doesn\'t work 100% of the time, it works and it is making progress. Pride flags are a symbolic way of exclaiming our presence and stating that we are not going away. Pride flags for subsets of the LGBTQA+ community help promote the inclusivity we seek. Just because the past is full of atrocities, it doesn\'t mean the future is as well, but if we all assume the worst of others and lose hope, the world isn\'t going to get better. Yes, white people have and are oppressing nonwhite people. That doesn\'t mean that every white person is bad, just like it doesn\'t mean every poc is good. We have to trust each other to get anywhere. Pride flags are not a bad thing.\n\nTL;DR: racism lives on, it has harmed people and continues to do so today, but trying to right every single wrong of the past isn\'t going to work because the world changes. If we want to change the world, we have to change ourselves first, as scary as that change might be. If we continue to use old mindsets to right old problems in a vastly different world, the future may end up as negative as the past.', ""this feels, to me, like folks arguing about the menu when we (mostly all) what to change the food supply chain.  \n  \nlike, cool overthinking but here is some recommended action:  \ndon't buy shit that isn't aligned with your values (insofar as possible under capitalism),\ngive money directly to folks who are doing work aligned with your values (I recommend FIERCE NYC, but that's where I live - find folks where you live),  \nshow up in your community w the rad folks doing work you admire (and don't ask how to help, just start helping by making coffee or taking out the trash.

Which is fucking bullshit, flags simply represent *something*.', '[deleted]', 'Sorry for a lot of words - opportunities to think heavily about flags are rare in modern discourse\n\nIt seems to me that the first user is saying that the modern LGBT rights movement as expressed in the developed world facilitates a certain kind of global paternalism from first-world nations that were faster to change their laws, and that this paternalism runs parallel to centuries-old colonialist routes. Then we can hypothesize that people in the third world, who are the targets of this alleged paternalism, might feel colonized by the new ""nations"" of LGBT people as represented by their flags. This is silly and disingenuous because we all understand that flags don\'t necessarily represent nations; small towns have flags, letters at sea have flags, the Olympics and Paralympics have flags, various disabilities have flags, even sports rulings by referees have flags. The poster\'s idea is really based on a very misguided idea of what a flag is or can represent, and that false foundation unfortunately underlies a lot of what they have to say. \n\nThen the poster says that the original rainbow gay pride flag was a ""failure"" because people have developed flags for LGBT sub-groups. I think this would be true if the development of those flags led people to stop using the original rainbow flag; like a word, a flag ""fails"" or not based on whether people choose to use it to express their ideas and allegiances. In this case the rainbow flag has been an obvious success because it\'s still used across the world to represent LGBT people. The poster raises concerns about the proliferation of new flags representing some kind of LGBT balkanization, but there\'s a wide understanding that the other flags delineate groups under the LGBT umbrella covered by the rainbow one, and you often see these flags used side-by-side, so the concern is simply unrealized.  \n\nThen there\'s a thing about poor Wikipedia coverage of LGBT rights in Samoa, but the author doesn\'t do a good of explaining why this is a ""serious problem"" as they allege or how it comes into the flags unless you\'ve already accepted the dubious thesis that the flags necessarily symbolize a form of neo-colonialism. We end on the claim that non-white people, who of course must all hate the flags we\'re told, ""started"" the gay rights movement, which I guess is true in American history textbooks where the timeline starts at the Stonewall riots, but otherwise this claim is obviously preposterous. In all societies throughout history that have mandated a fixed-gender heterosexual lifestyle, gay and bisexual and transgender people have worked to maintain opportunities to sexually express themselves and to undermine the ideologies that made their interests taboo. Simply put, it\'s not a very original idea that people shouldn\'t die for fucking each other, wearing what they want to wear, etc. The poster seems to visualize the LGBT rights movement as like a restaurant chain where the deed can get bought up by a crooked CEO who rebrands the whole thing in problematic ways, rather than a vast network of independent and organically formed cultures and organizations that voluntarily adopted the LGBT flags for their value as symbols. \n\nHere\'s an interesting idea - under the framework used by this poster, what should we make of the increasingly common Rainbow flag which adds black and brown stripes to represent black and brown people? I think the proliferation of this flag shows that the use of LGBT flags in general is very decentralized and offers new symbolic levels that we can use to hash out the political conflicts covered in this conversation.\n\nTL;DR: Flags are communicative tools we adopt to serve functions, but not necessarily colonialist or nationalist functions. They represent groups and ideas. The decentralized way that the gay flags have spread is particularly neat, and it\'s taken place because people get use from the flags as tools to quickly get their ideas across - ideas ranging from radical homophobia to radical homosupremacy. This poster is saying ""the flags must represent a nation, and the nation of western gays would be bad, so it shouldn\'t have a flag,"" which seems silly to me, even setting aside the assumption that flags represent national endeavors, because of course even the worst people in the world should have flags to mark who and what they stand for. If the Nazis didn\'t have flags, how would we know who to shoot? \n\nIf you like thinking about flags, their history, and what they can represent (both intentionally and unintentionally), check out /r/vexillology and /r/leftistvexillology!', ""My kneejerk reaction is this seems unnecessarily divisive. I see the point about flags being less than ideal from a symbolic and historic perspective but imo that's not what people think of when they see the rainbow flag. I know for me it cheers me up even as a small nod towards the LGBTQIA+ community as an afterthought and it does seem to engender a sense of community to have a symbol for us all."", 'I think some of these points are iffy. I definitely agree with you, /u/mygenderiscomrade, with regards to the fact that a general solidarity flag hasn\'t failed just because subcultures within that overarching group exist. It reminds me of people who say stuff like ""labels don\'t matter, everyone should stop ""branching off"" and just call themselves \'queer\'"". I do not agree.\n\nI can understand and respect that the intersections of race and queerness can make a situation like this complicated, though. There are definitely plenty of racist white LGBT people that alienate POC members of our community with their bullshit, regardless of whether or not it was intentional. I just don\'t know if I agree with this person\'s particular take on the flags...', 'I don\'t think any of the critiques levied here are wrong, but I think sourcing them to flags is... Missing the bigger picture, in a way. I don\'t think the problems mentioned here are ultimately about flags as a symbol, because I think any symbol that grows up in a colonial, capitalist society is prone to reproducing the problems of its context society, no matter how it\'s presented. \n\nLike, \n\n>but all i can think is: why did these symbols of ~community~ solidarity have to be _flags_?\n\nI don\'t think they had to be flags, and I think any community symbol that happened in their stead would ultimately have become prone to the same critiques tumblr OP has for flags. Certainly we\'re prone to take up a flag for the reasons tumblr OP critiques, but there\'s also a reason flags *became* nationalist symbols to begin with - they\'re reproducable, transferable, and crucially, they\'re easily recognizeable. They also wouldn\'t be the first symbology to be reclaimed from oppressors - the pink triangle has a pretty prominent place in queer movements. \n\nFor another feature of queer movements that\'s been perverted from its intent, we need look no further than Pride events - they originated out of Stonewall, a riot against police oppression of especially poor, especially POC, especially trans and/or gender-nonconforming Queer people. And these days they\'re full of virtue-signalling capitalist corporations, heavily policed through complicity of their own organizers, and oftentimes hostile to POC and other multiply-marginalized queer people. And many, if not most of them, originated on stolen land and are still happening on stolen land. \n\n>furthermore, as symbols of solidarity, we can also see that the flags are dismal and total failures. the original pride flag was created with some notion of representing the entire community, but as that post shows, the proliferation of flags shows that this is a failure.\n\nIf changing over time is a sign of failure to represent a community, ""LGBTQ"" is an equal failure; it\'s certainly gone through as many permutations as the flags. And in some ways it *is* a failure... How often has ""LGBT"" excluded trans people? How often has ""LGBTQ"" excluded Black, Indigenous, and other POC queer folk? Excluded poor queer folk? Excluded disabled queer folk? I\'m sure I could go on. \n\nThe movement itself is flawed and carries reflections of colonial and capitalist exploitation because it\'s trying to make space in a society that is colonial and capitalist in nature. It is the nature of capitalism to co-opt revolutionary movements and pervert their expressions to its own ends.  The isn\'t new information. \n\nI don\'t think it\'s possible to get around those flaws no matter what the symbology looks like. I don\'t think that makes the whole movement a wash, or negates the progress that\'s been made. I think what it means is that our work is not done, that we must be vigilant against the ways and places capitalism and colonialism are perverting our movement and/or using us, and that we should constantly strive towards a more revolutionary movement and existence as queer people.\n\nEdit to add - Disclosure: I\'m white, and I live on stolen land.', 'I don\'t have a simple answer to this question. It goes into things like if nationalism is good or bad.\n\nThe concept of a nation exists beyond land (ie: ""asgard is not a place; it\'s a people""). This is a huge sticky topic that I\'ve also been struggling with recently as well. I\'m personally not a nationalist (all belongs to all). But then there are concepts like how some cultures (like some first nation cultures) consider themselves to be part of their particular land (so you can\'t separate the land from the people without damaging their culture). And how some cultures have been destroyed via forced immigration and ""ethnic cleansing"" or ""forced integration"".', 'I agree with the idea that we should strive for a world without flags but this is tied up with the idea of ""owning"" land. In a world without flags and borders land cannot be owned by (or stolen from) any group of people. That\'s the whole point. I think the rainbow is more than just a flag though. It\'s more like a symbol that can be used by anyone.', 'I dunno what their damage is, but flags represent... whatever the hell the people who design them want them to, so literally anything. Movements, ideas/ideologies, organizations, agencies, nations, nation-states, kingdoms, partisan/guerilla/rebel groups, polities of every kind, and other entities can use, do use, or have used flags to represent themselves or their aims or ideas.        \n\nOutside of the confines of that person\'s mind, flags can mean and be used for anything. I guess someone go tell the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, the Zapatistas, Australian aboriginal peoples, and traffic controllers that they\'re colonialists and imperialists. Flags and/or banners predate the nation-state by centuries at least, and have been used in anti-colonial struggles for a while too.            \n\nI legitimately don\'t know where their argument comes from. It\'s a lot like saying ""English was imposed on native peoples and spoken by imperialists, so no one should ever use it again."" Like, the spread of the English language is largely due to settler colonialism and imperialism, but the language itself is not to blame for that and it can now be used to denounce imperialism and advocate multilingual education and the preservation of indigenous tongues.', ""I don't think the OP was actually talking about flags, but queer liberation as a mere concept. That it's nothing but The White Man:tm: imposing his values, such as societal progress, onto other cultures.\n\nThis feels like a parody, honestly.

495,"A question to my comrades (especially well read socialists and enbies); beyond the latest controversy, what are some of your problems with ContraPoints? Is she really a liberal truscum?","Kia ora,

I started my move towards leftism and progressivism about the time that I came out as trans and started seeking HRT and other treatments. Before that I was a bit of a liberal, maybe more on the Social Democrat side, who basically just thought I was left because I didn't like Trump and Theresa May (not exactly a high bar, being that I'm not a monster nor do I own land).

Then I started getting interested in the actual philosophy behind the political movements that were pushing against those people. The history of things like my own country (New Zealand)'s Labour party. Hearing language used by politicians on the cusp of social-dem and socialist (like Corbyn and Sanders) and looking into what it actually meant. What unionising was, little things like that.

But it wasn't really until I discovered Natalie Wynn, hbomberguy, and Olly Thorn that I really *understood* the left-wing, and started being able to really call myself part of it. I went from one of those shitty 'oh well I'm left wing but I'm not a communist cos communism bad' to being the kind of person who actually likes to read (though isn't very good at) theory. Watching them also opened my mind beyond the gender binary, gave me compelling arguments for why enbies are valid and why my previously rather transmedicalist arguments for my own existence were not only unnecessary but harmful. 

In particular, Contra's videos like 'Genderqueer', 'Non-binary genders', and 'Pronouns' are the videos of hers I attribute to my understanding of enbies, and her videos like 'Why Capitalism is Bad', 'Debating the Alt-Right', and 'How to recognise a Fascist' shook off my liberal tendencies and started my basic understanding of socialism.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is; is there something I missed? Was my becoming more left and enby-accepting just accidental, given that I see people on here calling her a liberal and a truscum so often?

**TL;DR: Contrapoints helped me become a real lefty and NB-accepting, and I'm curious to know the opinion of enbies and well read lefties on why she's 'problematic' beyond the well-known recent controversy. Kia mihi!**",dtbcty,172,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageGenderBinary/comments/dtbcty/a_question_to_my_comrades_especially_well_read/,"['Let\'s look at this from the perspective of ""Why does one watch a Contrapoints video?""\n\nOne reason is her anti capitalism. From an anticapitalist perspective, though, she\'s just far more liberal than a lot of people make her out to be or thought she was. You can see this in ""The Left"", ""The Aesthetic"", and basically any video that prominently features Tabby. She brushes off anything but electoral reform as being unachievable or idealistic, and caricatures (edit: fixed spelling) the far left as just shouting ""revolution!"" over and over without having a plan. The reality is, the left has several, well-defined, potentially actionable ideas for How To Revolution - but the ideas conflict with each other. Better creators may take these ideas in good faith and analyze how they measure up to one another, but she\'s not interested in doing so.\n\nAnother reason is her anti-fascist work. This is the stuff I respect her for the most, but she\'s expressed disinterest in continuing to make videos on that subject. Her most recent ""deradicalization"" video, ""Men"", was also tainted (as u/GoombOC points out) by her willingness to punch left instead of engaging in anticapitalist critique.\n\nA third reason is her gender analysis. Plenty of people have pointed out its flaws here already, so all I\'ll add is this: even if you don\'t think her recent kerfuffles make her a Bad Person (which, tbh, I don\'t), they do harm her credibility as someone who talks about gender. Everything she says on this topic has been tainted with her terrible takes about nonbinary people.\n\nA fourth reason is to just learn what she thinks and believes. Her Socratic-style videos completely obfuscate this, making it impossible to understand which person she actually agrees with, allowing the audience to read anything into them and her. This taints every video she uses it in, including ones where you\'re clearly supposed to take a side, because she has to communicate that ""This time, one of these people is wrong,"" by making one of them a strawman (see: her truscum video). That, or she doesn\'t distinguish them properly, and everyone thinks she believes The Bad Thing. Which, functionally, she might as well if it\'s that easy to confuse.\n\nA fifth reason is, well, you just like watching someone prance around in makeup and colored lights, conducting theatrical, well-researched discussions on philosophy and contemporary politics. In which case, just watch Philosophy Tube.\n\nI surmise that, rather than ""cancelling"" Contra for being a ""bad person,"" there\'s just no *reason* to watch her videos anymore.', 'This is complicated and messy. Woof. Ideally I\'d need one of those crazy person string boards you see in crime thrillers but I\'ll try my best in this reddit post. Let\'s hope this isn\'t too confusing.\n\nLets start with my bonafides\n\nI\'m nonbinary (trans-feminine genderfluid demi-woman) and a De Leonist (syndicalist libertarian-marxist). My pronouns are they/them/theirs.\n\nNow, let\'s move onto Natalie.\n\nIssue number 1 is she says dumb shit and then just kinda tries to hurry past it. All of us say dumb shit sometimes, but most of us say sorry. If she apologized more often she\'d face a lot less genuine criticism. This is more of a grit your teeth and roll your eyes thing, but apologizing is important, ya know?\n\nSo a very bad thing she said recently is that Buck Angel (who she recently had on a video for a 12 second audio clip) is truscum because he\'s old, and he shouldn\'t be judged for being truscum, because he\'s old. This is extremely offensive to all the old people who aren\'t truscum. She admits she\'s a big fan of Buck, because he was important to her because he was the first transperson she knew who passed really well. He\'s an aspirational figure for her in the worst way possible (for the sake of brevity I\'m just gonna assume you know Buck is a bad bad man). She really wants to pass (keep this in mind it\'s super important). She downplays his extremely toxic behavior due to this shallow parasocial relationship she has with him. She admires him because he looks good. The saying ""Never meet your heroes"" comes to mind, expect she\'s purposefully not meeting her hero, keeping his horrific behavior at arms length. She\'s trying to be not be affiliated with this guy while also giving him a platform, which, honey, that just isn\'t how it works.\n\nLast paragraph I said that she said that Buck was truscum because he\'s old. Apparently she said that while drunk. I have no way of verifying that. All I\'ve got is a transcript. The video she where she says that is behind a paywall.\n\nShe\'s made previous comments on her twitter that are quite frankly, stupid and short-sighted. Essentially she complained about people not assuming her gender (god I wish I had the luxury of people not assuming my gender) and she talked about how it made her feel bad (valid). It\'s a valid and understandable statement, but also a toxic one. She finished her complaint with the statement that she\'s happy to have her pronouns asked if it makes nonbinary people more comfortable. So, it\'s actually not that bad a thing she said, just, some deeply ingrained toxicity that she\'s trying to work past. Her big issue was she blamed people trying to be ""fake woke"" on asking for her pronouns, rather than being charitable and just assuming people are just trying to be kind. \n\nShe\'s a young woman going through a very difficult period in her life in a very public setting. She\'s got a lot of deeply ingrained toxicity and she\'s working through that shit publicly. Her biggest problem is her refusal to just say the words ""I\'m sorry"".\n\nSo to answer your questions:\n\nIs she a liberal? Kinda, she\'s gotten less anti-capitalist, which, as a marxist makes sense, she\'s accumulating wealth and the privilege wealth entails so it makes sense she\'d be less interested in getting rid of that kind of privilege. But also she was never that far left to begin with. I feel like this criticism is mostly made by people who have grown faster than she has.\n\nIs she truscum? Probably not. Not yet at least. She\'s just kinda desperate for validation and is looking for it in the wrong places. It\'s understandable but also not something we should support as a community. As said previously, she is super focused on passing.', 'Regardless of her comments on NBs, I‚Äôve been slowly getting less interested in her videos. Her production values are getting increasingly overbearing to the point that her recent videos are absolute slogs to watch. Her ideas have also steadily gotten less interesting and more directionless with time. She‚Äôs always sorta had these problems, but fame and validation from a large fanbase has worsened it.\n\n  The Men video for me really exposed a lot of her weaknesses as a creator. She had an amazing opportunity to talk about how capitalism is inherently emasculating to most men, and under socialism the need for a masculine image would be lessoned. Instead, she trails off, agrees with MRAs that women‚Äôs lib is a problem, offers no further direction, then punches left. Maybe it‚Äôs more a sign of my political alignments shifting, but I don‚Äôt wanna watch fifty minutes of smothered production with maybe ten minutes‚Äô worth of socdem takes in there.\n\n\nAs for her takes on NBs, she very clearly believes some prejudiced and gross shit, and we‚Äôre gonna have to deal with that. When it comes to leftism, you really should kill your heroes and try to take their good with their bad. Glenn Greenwald has said some amazingly dumb and transphobic shit, but I still respect what he‚Äôs doing in Brazil. Similarly, I‚Äôll be thankful to Contra for helping me understand my gender identity even if I don‚Äôt like her current ideas or content very much.', '>is there something I missed?\n\nIf your only knowledge of Contra was through video & not the many Twitter spats she\'s had, 100% you\'ve missed a lot. Contra\'s only really teetered close to coming mask off in ""The Aesthetic"" where she kinda implies that NBs aren\'t valid & our justification for validity is ""weak"". But on Twitter she\'s in constant controversy because she keeps saying shit that harms NBs or paints us in a bad light, sometimes maybe gives a weak apology, and then moves on to do it all over again in a few months. What we\'re seeing in the strong pushback against her right now is a lot of people\'s frustration & hurt boiling over because Contra has never shown that she is able to grow from past mistakes.\n\n>Was my becoming more left and enby-accepting just accidental, given that  I see people on here calling her a liberal and a truscum so often?\n\nI wouldn\'t say becoming more left is accidental, because for a liberal Contra is very willing to engage with leftist thought in a fair and coherent manner. She\'s not the liberal who\'s going around on YouTube trying to argue that leftist policies & ideas will never work & we all just need to trust our rich overlords. And again, if your only exposure to Contra is video, you being NB accepting isn\'t really accident, because Contra goes through lengths to portray herself a such on YouTube.', ""All her videos are in Socratic Dialogue so they are extremely easy to read as in support of whatever your view is, she obfuscates what she actually thinks, if her goal is to de-radicalize I don't see how this is a good strategy. \n\nAlso too many in her fanbase idolize her an unhealthy amount which causes them to defend her based on thier idolized vision of her and not just... her... I saw someone refer to the fandom as a support group and!!! no!!! the fans aren't her friends!!! She needs to go be drunk and upset with her friends and do it on stream! this isn't blaming her for doing that but its super unhealthy!"", 'Some people do seem to overstate her transgressions if you ask me but something she did recently that kinda stung was mentioned in /u/Viking_Swan \'s comment about being ""fake woke"" is that she was pretty clearly alluding to Hbomberguy and in reference to his Donkey Kong stream, you know the one that raised thousands and thousands of dollars for a charity that helps trans youth.\n\nSo that felt ***VERY*** uncalled for, it doesn\'t help in the slightest that in the same breath she was praising Buck fucking Angel.', 'She says a lot of really (self-deprecating) misogynist and transphobic shit ""ironically"", which at least has *the appearance of* being things that she honestly believes about herself on some level, or rather that she appears to be scared others believe about her, and which has the ultimate function of being ""I\'m not like those other (girls/trans people)"" statements. Which is back to being misogynist and transphobic.\n\nEverything she says is wrapped in so many layers of irony that it becomes difficult to tell what she *actually* believes. And in the meantime, it\'s hurtful. I don\'t LIKE watching a video where she calls herself - and by extension, the rest of us - slurs, and in the process tells clueless cis people that that\'s all right. You know?\n\nWhat I\'d really like to see from her is just sincerety.', 'I\'m not sure if she is truscum or not, but at this point with her refusal to apologise or make any attempt to correct for her actions I don\'t think her ""real"" beliefs matter.', 'Honestly, half of my criticism feels reactionary and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm working on. By that I mean, as an NB person I find her comments about NB experiences - and her alliance with Buck Angel troubling - but I wouldn‚Äôt feel such a powerful need to criticize her behavior (ie, to keep having this conversation over and over again) if the people on BreadTube and ContraPoints didn‚Äôt constantly act like she‚Äôs a saint who can do no wrong.', 'I think the biggest problem I have is how her fanbase is reacting to this. The fanbase in my opinion seems incredibly insular and very aggressively protective of her. Her subreddit banned the word ""truscum"" and they\'re incredibly eager to try to dismiss any criticism. I know this sounds cliche but they don\'t want to try to discuss a potential fix to the problem: they just want to forget it happened. Like for example, after the whole ""you shouldn\'t say your pronoun"" debacle, there were posts on that subreddit about potential solutions to that problem (like ""everyone should say pronouns"" ect.) and there were posts basically saying ""Natalie is a saint and we all love her!"" Guess which posts did well and which posts bombed? The ""Natalie is a saint"" posts did well.\n\nI know Natalie fucked up but they weren\'t huge fuck ups. Honestly I think a well worded apology and staying out of trouble would go a long way to fixing the fuck ups. The problem I have is that her fanbase doesn\'t seem to care about any of this and seem almost cult like', '>I guess what I\'m trying to ask is; is there something I missed? Was my becoming more left and enby-accepting just accidental, given that I see people on here calling her a liberal and a truscum so often?\n\nNo, it\'s not really a coincidence. Hegemonic views are pushed, in a substantial way, simply by dominating the discourse. Public education, corporate journalism/media, and dominant political parties all repeat many of the same ideas and drive conversations around the same topics from a specific lens of liberalism. Much is said about raising or lowering taxes, but nothing is said about the institution of private property itself. Much is said about trans people using bathrooms or participating in sports, but nothing is said about how gender itself is merely a social construct and what it means to have a false binary imposed on every space in public life.\n\nLeftTubers like ContraPoints and PhilosophyTube break from that hegemony, and discuss perspectives critical of it. By opening the conversation to critical perspectives, and presenting good faith arguments against what is the dominant conventional wisdom, they shift the narrative in a way that grants legitimacy to viewpoints that aim to deconstruct and subvert extant hierarchical norms. Letting the arguments and facts be aired in a rational setting, it becomes clear that one side (hegemonic views) is accepted because of cultural inertia and the rejection of the other occurs out of hand in order to appease existing power structures, in spite of legitimate grievances and in contravention of justice. It\'s very reasonable that when you see things presented that way that you would start to question those hegemonic views and instead be open to the more radical counterparts.\n\nThat said, Natalie has said that she herself doesn\'t really hold the sort of far-left stances that many who have been radicalized by her content do. She hasn\'t really defined what her political leanings are, but I think it\'s safe to say that she\'s at least a social democrat and, if I\'m being very charitable with the ambitions and understandings of democratic socialists, perhaps might be one of them\\*. It\'s clear that she\'s not a Marxist-Leninist or a revolutionary syndicalist or anything of that sort. Depending on your own political perspective (MLs and Maoists particularly throw that around a lot), this might make Nat a liberal. Since she hasn\'t really clarified her own perspective it\'s hard to say for sure, but if we\'re defining a liberal as someone who believes in the core concepts of liberalism, and in particular the economic system that comes with it (of which social democracy is a subset), I\'d say there\'s at least a 70% chance she is a liberal. \n\nHowever, I don\'t think though that, given the numerous videos she\'s made deconstructing binary gender and transmedical beliefs, that allegation holds up to much scrutiny. She may have some internalized transphobia and binarism (as practically everyone who lives in modern globalized society does, including lots of trans folx) that comes to the surface at times, but that\'s a far cry from her being an ardent truscum. As an enby it\'s disappointing that she doesn\'t own up to and address the things that she\'s said as soon as they\'re pointed out, but taking criticism is hard for a lot of people and I\'ve said a lot of worse things about myself in moments of self-loathing, so it\'s nothing cancel-worthy imo.\n\n\\*(understanding the difference as being that a socdem genuinely believes that the excesses of capitalism can be reined in by regulation and policy while a demsoc genuinely believes that capitalism is inherently abusive but that the only sustainable path to revolution is by a ""changing hearts and minds"" strategy that sees revolution as ultimately coming from public referendum in democratic processes rather than violent seizure of the state and institution of a dictatorship)', ""For me, she's wasted so many second chances that I don't even care if she's trying to get it right 'this time.'

The Breadtubers show 100% more class solidarity with each other than with the audiences they attract."", 'Criticism of Contra Points has a long backlog. I will say that in general, reddit is a lot more forgiving to her than tumblr, but transfeminine people on most platforms have grown to dislike her faster. There are critisms which I find excessive that I won\'t mention here, but I will mention the big ones.\n\n Her ""What\'s Wrong with Capitalism"" videos saw her referring to capitalists as ""reptiles,"" an ironic but still harmful invocation of the antisemitic lizard people conspiracy. When criticized about it, she gave her standard apology (read: I\'m sorry you interpreted my actions as bad). She then proceeded to sell merchandise with the aforementioned reptiles on it, and this time added the line ""David Icke was right,"" further solidifying the ""ironic"" antisemitism. \n\nThe next major issue was with her video ""The Aesthetic"", were she (in the persona of one of her characters) espoused the opinion that trans people who don\'t pass are ""functionally"" their assigned gender. In response to the controversy, she made statements on Twitter (that have since been deleted) that stated she (herself, not a character) believed that. \n\nA short time later, she released the ""Are T***s Gay"" video (*s mine). This was problematic for four reasons. First, she engaged with the question as though it were a real question and not a transphobic joke. Second, she did not censor the title, exposing several trans people to a slur without warning. Third, she completely left nonbinary people out of the discussion, reducing it to a completely binary discussion. And lastly, she said that there was nothing gay about a man being attracted to a trans woman that passed well and had begun HRT, leaving trans women who didn\'t fit into those categories out in the cold.\n\nThere\'s a lot of other stuff, like owning nazi fetish gear (seems fine to me, it\'s a costume), ""engaging "" with terf ideas in ""TERFs"" ( the terfs disagree), clearly creating the character of Tabby in order to mock actual leftists (which backfired spectacularly when Tabby became more popular than Contra), and the general decline in the quality of her videos ( I first noticed with ""Beauty"").\n\nI think that covers everything.', 'Like for real, it feels like in her earlier videos Tabby was a self-deprecating cartoonized version of a person closer to her self, and that over the last year she moved through being a Justine, and is now approaching Tiffany Tumbles (except in terms of capital-p Politics).', 'I thought ""Why Capitalism is Bad"" was a pretty good video stylistically, but it pales in comparison to analysis from many others. Watching some livestreams of hers from around that time, it became clear that her position was kind of ""capitalism is bad, but there\'s nothing we can do about it and leftists are deluding themselves, I\'ll have another glass of wine"". I read a comment on reddit recently that said Natalie made the capitalism videos because she thought her leftist audience wanted them. I also remember her saying she\'s a ""pessimistic socialist"". Sounds about right. Though I\'d maybe describe her as a ""pessimistic anti-capitalist"" rather than a socialist. I don\'t know what socialism is if you don\'t think we can build something better beyond capitalism.\n\nI bet ""Why Capitalism is Bad"" could convince libs that capitalism is bad, but perhaps not that socialism is good or that capitalism should be replaced. That\'s a good thing. Baby steps.\n\nNot sure if this has changed since this was all at least a year ago before I stopped watching all of her videos.', 'there are some really great reasons articulated in here and i\'d only really like to add one single one: in her transtrenders video, which was supposed to be her non-binary support magnum opus, she completely neglects to bring up the gender binary at all, and i\'m relatively certain I know why. a few years ago, when i started watching her channel, i thought ""wow, she was a philosophy phd candidate who quotes all these thinkers I\'ve never heard of! she must really know her stuff."" fast forward a few years, and after doing a great deal of reading myself, both of queer theory thinkers and marxist thinkers, it\'s very apparent to me that she barely knows anything at all about these subjects. i mean, honestly, when you get past the surface of why capitalism is bad and why trans people are valid, her arguments and critiques are quite weak. the fact that she\'s misinterpreted Judith fucking Butler (who is an absolutely core queer theorist and philosopher that you literally NEED to understand in order to mount any substantial critique of transphobia or theory of gender) multiple times in multiple videos points to this. straight up, she doesn\'t actually know what she\'s talking about. and this is made clear in her trenders video - i think the reasons she doesn\'t bring up the gender binary is because *she doesn\'t really know what it is.* it\'s not just the idea that ""there are men and there are women and that\'s it."" it\'s much, more more complicated than that, and in order to make any case in favor of non-binary validity, you need to talk about it and its history and ties to colonialism and capitalism. she\'s just not intellectually equipped to do that. she hasn\'t done the reading. this is further evidenced by her Pronouns video in which she haphazardly guesses at what it means to be non-binary rather than lay it out for the audience. she doesn\'t understand the binary, she doesn\'t understand the history, she doesn\'t understand any deeper queer theorists because she hasn\'t read any of them. THIS is one of the major reasons i dislike her so much - she genuinely and truly does not know what she\'s talking about, and yet purports to be some sort of authority on these topics. \n\nalso she\'s a liberal. i know other people have said it but I just wanted to echo that.', 'Not really a communist critique but more one I just don\'t see come up a lot: Natalie talks a lot about being trans and trans experiences, but often defines that as being transfeminine specifically. Now, when she\'s talking about her own experiences, that\'s not really an issue - the problem is when she\'s talking to a largely cis audience and saying ""this is what being trans is"", and only discussing trans women.\n\nShe\'s attempted a few times... in one of her videos, she mentions trans men\'s genitals as a mirror to the whole ""feminine penis"" thing. And yes, she had Buck Angel in her latest video. It still hardly feels like enough, though, when her own self-admitted goal is to educate and convince reactionaries and other people who may be ignorant. (It also doesn\'t help that in one of her infamous threads, the one after the video where she positions passing as when trans women experience misogyny, she stated that trans men as a whole do not... which is a super unnuanced take, and in the context seems to state that only passing trans women experience misogyny, and any other trans person at all contributes? Whack). \n\nIt just rubs me the wrong way entirely. It\'s very frustrating seeing transness continuously be considered synonymous to trans womanhood. If she was a small channel or only talking about her own experiences I wouldn\'t care, but she\'s got a massive audience and tries to represent trans people broadly, thus ignoring trans men is irresponsible, or hurtful at least.', ""I suppose I should clarify why I make such a post; the dogmatic anti-Contrapoints comments and posts I've seen on this sub have left me feeling quite alienated because she was my 'in' to this group of ideologies - so I decided I wanted to hear some less dogmatic and more informative criticism of Natalie and try understand how some people perceive her so differently to me.\n\nI'm also fairly worried about Natalie, due to her previous acknowledgement that she has a drinking problem and the fact that in the stream she did most recently in which she says 'the problematic stuff' she's quite clearly off her face. I feel like the dogma that some parts of the community are creating is seriously negatively effecting her and not having the positive influence we're trying to have when we criticise her."", ""I don't think the question now is whether she is problematic, because I think that's pretty clear and going off her past interactions I only see the schism deepening. What I think the real question should be is: when will it stop being controversial to acknowledge she has a problem that needs to be addressed?"", ""Do you know Tabby? Apparently that character was supposed to represent everything she didn't like about the left and yet a lot of people, including myself, see Tabby as pretty cool and someone to emulate. And I dunno when I was watching her videos from like April 2019 or so, I remember her having some dumb takes about gender. Something involving presentation or aesthetics or whatever. And while yes she helped turn me from a reactionary lib to a socdem, I honestly think Chapo pushed me over the edge into proper socialism, specifically anarchism."", ""I just don't agree with 100% of the stuff she says, but if I had to name a specific issue, it would be that sometimes she's a little too charitable to the people on the opposite side of her discourse; for instance, she suggests TERFs are traumatized victims of male violence instead of shitheaded bigots who would much sooner ally with cis men than trans women. But those are really just nitpicks. I'm non-binary and wasn't offended by the trender video or the whole Twitter blowout. I think she's funny and does a decent job explaining Leftism 101 to people who could easily be radicalized in the other direction"", 'I still enjoy her videos, but I don\'t put as much weight on them as I did when I first found them. I think she is at least liberal approaching if not a liberal. She makes it clear, ""she likes stuff. "" while she\'s critical of capitalism and is anti free market, pro-worker,  I don\'t think she\'s quite full anti-capitalism. I could be wrong there, but I\'m not getting the full ""take down capitalism"" vibe from her, so much as a ""turn it down."" \n\nAs for the truscum part... I really don\'t think so. I think she has a problem with not thinking things through when speaking off script, and often puts her foot in her mouth. A lot of her ""anti-non-binary"" posts have, in my opinion, been blown out as anti-nb, when they were just expressing the frustration of the differences in needs of binary and non-binary trans folk, or the frustration of being singled out as trans in a mostly cis group. she has said a few things which are harder to defend... and could def do better at screening who she works with, but I don\'t think she is in line with the worst interpretations of her tweets. as a binary trans woman myself, though, I have a lot of bias on this part, as I find I align with a lot of her frustrations and experiences.', '[deleted]', ""She isn't super problematic at all.

Seeing so many people come to her defense by treating her as an infallible, ironically enough, queen. Many of them seemingly going out of their way it seems to hurt our Non-Binary comrades and to excuse rampant Trans Medicalism and Queerphobia. And demanding any of us with even basic criticism stop and prostrate ourselves because ""all they have done for us."" \n\nOver and over we hear lines that could come straight from a Reactionary Skeptic or Alt-Righter coming from our supposed allies and leaders.\n\nNow, she and her friends have received harassment but, many folx who stan her unconditionally use that fact as excuse for her bad and harmful actions and somehow proof that she shouldn\'t be critiqued. All while ignoring the harassment that her fans are doing to Enby folx or the viscous attack campaign that Buck Angle himself had done before working on this video.\n\nTruly, this is a shameful display from so called ""BreadTube"" and I hope online Leftism grows only more inclusive and Radical as a result.', ""I understand a lot of what she's saying here. Buck's a reactionary old man at this point, however she doesn't feel it's right to excommunicate him in the face of the activism he's done in the past. However she understands that many don't feel comfortable working with or conversing with him, and they're not wrong to do so. But to demand everyone publicly denounce him isn't a reasonable expectation. Human relationships don't work like that and it's easy to demand such things when it's not you that the demand is being made at.\n\nSome of this has to do with a generational divide that younger trans people didn't experience, similar to how old people elsewhere in life see things vert differently. As she says, a lot of gen-x and millenial trans people lived during a discourse in which being trans wasn't really something you could just claim to be. Not every trans person thought this way, obviously, but she claims that this was generally the way it went, and this matches what I've heard other older trans people say, so I don't have a reason to doubt her. Obviously these old fashioned views are offensive today and shouldn't be entertained.\n\nShe didn't handle this all that well but after being relentlessly harassed, and after her friends were relentlessly harassed for not publicly disowning her (going so far as to call PhilosophyTube a chaser or a TERF, which is ridiculous nonsense), she sort of shut down and felt that she couldn't do anything to fix it. She's a human, not a robot. Mistakes happen. I won't blame a marginalized person for not responding to abuse the absolute correct way.\n\nOverall I don't agree with her decision to have him in her video, but I understand why she did it and I don't think she's a fundamentally bad person based on that. The level of harassment she's been receiving is totally inappropriate and isn't being made in good faith. That doesn't describe _all_ of the flak she received, but it describes enough of it that she couldn't be reasonably expected to sift through the abuse to find the people who are being fair.

Obviously it's terrible that she didn't do more research into him but it's clear that she wasn't agreeing with his views on NBs (and has established her pro-enby position in previous videos). \n\nAlso important to note that Theryn used to be a truscum before Natalie 'brought them around' - so that may explain why *Theryn* didn't realise the possible problems with Buck's involvement."", ""> I don't know.

She also opens up about how much of an internal struggle this issue is for her because she's not even sure she's not NB.

Yes. \n\nDoes that mean we can just ignore it? No, because prejudice can still be harmful in a situation where leftist political goals are achieved, and in the meantime protecting minorities from discrimination is still important. \n\n>Do you think it‚Äòs important to abolish capitalism to recieve queer liberation? Why?\n\nEventually, yes. Nobody can be free under capitalism. LGBT people have it bad because we are made to feel unwelcome by society as a whole with widespread low level homophobia as well as outright discrimination and violence, and then spaces where we are safe are generally capitalist ventures. We're also vulnerable to being kicked out of our homes by homophobic parents, have higher rates of mental illness but less resources available to treat and trans people have specific and often expensive healthcare needs. \n\n>Why should the left support lgbtq+?\n\nFeels like an abstract question, like why should we have human rights or why should we strive for fairness?

I assume this is pointing to the recent contrapoints drama, where I see that very much the case there.', 'No one ever wants to talk about how the Western gender binary is inherently the weapon of racial oppression and settler colonialism, because it forces onto Indigenous and colonized communities the ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù Christian notions of gender and sexuality, And when they fail or refuse to conform to their oppressors‚Äô notions of proper moral behavior, then it‚Äôs used as the justification to commit genocide to ‚Äúprotect the poor savages from themselves!‚Äù This is the case both historically and in the present. Dozens if not hundreds of unique gender identities and family structures were obliterated during the European colonization of Africa, Australia, India, and the Americas. Heteronormativity and the reactionary gender binary of Catholicism were beaten and raped into the colonized by the colonizers over hundreds of years. Fun fact: the law in India that criminalized homosexuality that was overturned only a few years ago was word-for-word the statute imposed upon the Indians by British colonial government. \n\nAnd even today in America, the gender binary is explicitly white supremacist, and when non-whites violate those gender norms, even if they have and always will present as cis and het, they are punished for their ‚Äúdeviancy‚Äù. The misogynist standard of womanhood may have changed over the last 80 years from docile, stay-at-home middle America mother to the independent and educated working professional who waits for financial stability before having children; but neither of these things have ever described the experiences of black women in the US. The cultural standard for manhood may have shifted from the industrial union worker and family man to the successful millennial tech startup wunderkind; but neither of those thing have ever been applicable to Indigenous Hawaiians, Puerto Ricans, or Navajo. \n\nSo when Natalie not only says there is no problem with the established gender binary, but that she is being inconvenienced by people who think it‚Äôs total bullshit and reject it entirely, it has far less to do with her transness and everything to do with her whiteness.

557,Hi. Glad we are working on the sectarianism,"(Sorry this isnt a meme. I just think a little sincereposting is in order and the rules say the occasional prose is allowed. This is my first post to the sub but I promise I will switch to memes for future posts.)

I know there are disputes about the methods being used and as someone who only just joined tonight, I'm not informed enough to weigh in on that aspect.

But it flat out sucks as a trans Jewish ancom to be used as bait for sectarian fights. [Not specifically talking about this sub here to the exclusion of the rest of the left, but...]

I just saw one person call Makhno antisemitic even though he personally hunted down antisemites on principle and led a mixed army that voted for him directly, thus presumably approving of these activities and methods. And another person call the USSR antisemitic even though it was the government that made being Jewish legal/protected and antisemitism illegal for basically the first time in the region. In a third argument, people were debating whether the USSR or the Czech revolt were the real antisemites, when the deeper point seemed to be somewhere between ""haha troll a tankie/smashie"" and, charitably, ""I think it is very good/bad for Jews when people burn the communist manifesto"".

Some of us have ACTUAL family history surviving pogroms in Eastern Europe and this stuff isnt just a cool propaganda weapon for beating your sectarian opponent about the head with. Your personal views that one side is better for ethnoreligious minorities than the other dont make it less offensive to characterize the USSR, Black Army or whoever as fundamentally antisemitic. Some leftists are worse than the libs with this cynical shit.

Like my dude we honestly dont want to get into calling political groups antisemitic for things other than actually saying jews bad, because we could spend a *long* night dissecting every little thing that could make a political philosophy more or less safe for Jews, and the cultural vs political character of various acts that oppressed Jews whether because they were Jews or for whatever reason. Which could actually be a valuable debate except that all that nuance is quickly tossed out the window in favor of trading accusations. Basically ""You're the Le Pen of the left!"" ""No u!""

To end on a positive note, it feels like a lot of people agree that it both should and can get better quickly. The energy in this sub is pretty powerful to me, and I think we should be careful not to take it for granted. I think most people are here for the same basic reason and sociopolitical goals and theres a lot of promise rn.",cwemxm,133,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageGenderBinary/comments/cwemxm/hi_glad_we_are_working_on_the_sectarianism/,"['[deleted]', ""I'm into left unity up to the point I'm threatened with The Wall ^^tm .

She is a very kind sould who, as a defectologist and social worker, works hard to help children who are socially endangered or need special care/education; just as she was, coming from Roma family from Kosovo and growing up in an orphanage in Serbia's capital. The main problem is that very soon she will be obliged to leave that orphanage, and while she does have a job caring for those kids, it's at an underfunded public institution that can't pay her well enough for her to pay both rent and further medical transition costs. Also very few jobs are available at all here to trans people and racism could be another problem... (she got this one due to being a long time volunteer)

So please help her in any way you can, either by donating or sharing this where someone who can donate might see it. Further details about on what exactly money will be spent are in the link.

578,Howdy fellow gender traitors,"In response to the recent uptick in ML/Anarchist tension, we're installing a few more rules to try to keep shit from getting any more toxic. We're also in the works to create a way for active members of the community to vote on any changes in rules or moderation in the future, including these two rules.  
  
New rule: Be civil  
  
We're all trans leftists here. This is a meme sub. This is not a place to be spamming vitriol at other leftists. I know left unity isn't necessarily possible in the real world but this isn't a place for active organization of an actual movement. This is a place to share memes. We don't need to see peeps in this sub being insulting to other leftists.  
  
This includes spamming memes from your particular ideological viewpoint in order to garner a negative reaction from other members of this community.  
  
Feel free to spam as much vitriol at libs and fash as you want tho, always a good time.  
  
New rule: No more Juche/Stalin/Mao worship  
  
This is less an official statement against certain leftist leaders and more a way to avoid conflict. Almost always these things are posted to get a reaction rather than to share something with the community. Posts from an ML viewpoint are still allowed but follow the rule on civility in the comments section please.  
  
Feel free to let the mods know how you feel in the comments here or via modmail. We've had very few people send any modmail about anything recently despite the clear problems happening in the community. We do read all the modmail we get (it's a small enough sub that we're never inundated), so if you feel like you want to communicate with us please don't hesitate.  
  
Also it appears a clarification is needed for Rule 6, exclusionary content is only in reference to being inclusive of all gender identities, binary, non, and none in general.  This is clearly worded on the sidebar but this needs to be said due to misuse of this reporting those on ideological/political differences.  And please don't spam the report button. It's not a super-downvote. ML and anarchist content is allowed on here so long as it follows the rules.

Disgusted by the abuse towards LGBTQIA immigrants and asylum seekers? Join us at r/WhereAreTheChildren and take action!","r/WhereAreTheChildren is a new subreddit dedicated to uncovering, keeping track of, and taking action against the intensifying human rights violations being committed against immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, especially those who are children coming to the U.S. southern border. 


As we reach out and gain new members, we gain new insight on how we can maximize our ability to end these atrocities towards children. For example, as of now our sidebar encourages our members to: 



* **Follow the Money** With [Worthrises.org](https://worthrises.org/immigration#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1529940323820_29704), easily keep track of the companies profiting off of the detention of migrants. Lots of other great updated information included on their website: Flowchart of how people are detained, count of imprisoned immigrants, complete breakdown of companies who are profiting. I can't recommend this webpage enough.
_______________________________________

* **Find Detention Centers** [Torn Apart / Separados] (http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/1/) has an incredible interactive map of detention centers and much more. Highly recommend reading this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-everywhere-using-library-science-to-map-child-separation/amp?__twitter_impression=true) explaining the capabilities of this website. Also, [ICE.gov keeps a spreadsheet of camps](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/facilityInspections/dedicatedNonDedicatedFacilityList.xlsx). Make sure to note the 2 tabs to get both lists. Or find immigrant children‚Äôs shelters near you with [ProPublica‚Äôs interactive map](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/migrant-shelters-near-you). Here is a [list of CBP stations](http://concentrationcamps.us/), some of which hold immigrants, or manage immigrant detention centers, all good places to protest.
________________________________________


* **Organize, Volunteer, Donate** Want to take action? Don‚Äôt start from scratch! Search for orgs and activism groups in your area to join. It may be best to use Google or social media since there are so many, though there are resources to help you search as well, such as [Stand With Immigrants](https://www.standwithimmigrants.org) which can match your skills with local organizations. Or [Detention Watch Network](https://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/about/membership-directory), which has relevant orgs broken down by region and state. If you‚Äôre looking for donation suggestions, [here's a short list of organizations who provide free, essential services to immigrants](https://helpdetainedchildren.org) as well as a [slightly longer descriptive list of orgs helping immigrants and separated children](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/18/heres-list-organizations-are-mobilizing-help-separated-immigrant-child/amp/?__twitter_impression=true). These are all good orgs to follow on social media, join up with, volunteer for, and/or donate to if you can. We have also created [Operation Hope/Rinse/Repeat](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereAreTheChildren/comments/c5xuy2/operation_hope_rinse_repeat_announcement_of_mass/) if you‚Äôd like to send sanitary supplies to ICE camps/DOJ/your reps to send a symbolic message, or to orgs who will actually distribute them.

* **Contact Your Representatives**
[Use whoaremyrepresentatives.org](https://www.whoaremyrepresentatives.org/) to find and contact your local and federal reps. Speak your mind, they are real people and will respond to pressure if we put it on them. Don‚Äôt know what to ask for? You can contact your reps with a template created by RAICES demanding to [defund ICE and stop immigration raids](https://www.raicestexas.org/action/stop-the-raids/?ms=raices_tw)
________________________________________

* **Contact Corporations Who Profit From The Detainment Of Immigrants** [Here is an easy to use list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oZ5sp7_R-iqhd8VIjt-4-bwI1gPI0BVCDZI0Pt1Kx94/edit?usp=sharing) of corporations who are profiting, along with their business contact info. Also included are prepared sample statements in case you don‚Äôt know what to say.
________________________________________

* **Know Your Rights** Whether as a protester, an immigrant, someone within 100 miles of the border (under Border Patrol's jurisdiction), someone stopped by police, a DACA recipient, and more. [This page from ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights) includes links to quick guides which inform you of your civil rights. We also have gathered resources specifically for [how to deal with ICE](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereAreTheChildren/comments/c3h6u9/ice_raids_are_expected_to_start_on_sunday_in/). Use this info to protect yourself and one another! Also here is a [huge database](https://www.immigrationlawhelp.org/) of legal help providers for low income immigrants.

* **Blow The Whistle** Send helpful tips to ProPublica.org if you [know a child in a detention center or shelter facility](https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/do-you-know-a-child-in-a-detention-center-or-shelter-facility) or if you [know something about a shelter or detention facility](https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/do-you-know-something-about-a-detention-center-or-shelter-where-the-government-is-holding-children)

We also post daily news articles, updating one another on the latest atrocities happening to migrant children under the current U.S administration. Rather than posting separate articles in this space, u/dankmemeprofessor has recently [summarized the news you can find on our page very well](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c3seo4/ahead_of_ice_raids_illinois_governor_bans_private/ersx3h0/). We include summaries like theirs and [others like this](https://unitedwedream.org/the-truth-about-ice-and-cbp/ice-and-cbp-abuse-tracker/) on our page, which can be used to empower our protesters with the latest info as they take to the streets, contact corporations, and their representatives. 


As you can see, [we have already begun protesting](https://np.reddit.com/r/WhereAreTheChildren/comments/byd418/5_hours_outside_the_dc_holocaust_museum_some/), and will [continue to do so](https:/np.reddit.com/r/WhereAreTheChildren/comments/c3vsri/im_with_some_beautiful_people_today_occupying_ice/). Many of our members just attended the nationwide protest, Lights for Liberty [July 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereAreTheChildren/comments/c8rfg0/nationwide_protest_friday_evening_july_12_with/). As noted in the post, we‚Äôre learning how to work together with existing organizations and add events when locations for our towns aren‚Äôt included. Our members have also created a [mail-based protest](https://np.reddit.com/r/WhereAreTheChildren/comments/c5xuy2/operation_hope_rinse_repeat_announcement_of_mass/) which allows everyone, including concerned people outside the U.S., to participate in taking action. 



We are a collaborative subreddit, reaching out to and gaining the support of many different subs. We recognize that with the support from members of a variety of subreddits, we are able to combine unique and key perspectives on our sub, which not only strengthens our ability to understand what is happening, but also our ability to put an end to the increasingly racist and systematic horrors immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, especially children, are facing as they try to seek refuge in the United States.

The idea of heterosexuality (and its implications that two opposing genders exist) is a cultural one from our indoctrinators/colonizers. These colonizers managed to force these ideas on large groups of people across the globe via violent assimilation, slave labor, and genocide.   \n\n\nMany societies around the world have a unique history with sex and gender, that was disrupted during colonialism and replaced with the colonizer's perspective.

671,Is anyone else kinda disillusioned by the lack of intellectual integrity in the spread of information in pop culture?,"I see a pattern of information being passed down from someone who acquired it first hand, to second hand, to more and more distant levels of acquisition. And it‚Äôs like every step of the way, the information becomes less and less based in reality.

Popular discussion about gender completely disregards how gender even came to be, the invention of heterosexuality (which mandates a gender binary) and the way it was/is forced onto us via colonialism and now capitalism/assimilation of white ideas. 

Discussion about violence against trans people is almost the only time we hear about trans women and femmes of color even though they are integral actors in the history of gender non-conformity. This narrative of helpless twoc completely overpowers the success, growth, pride, and fire of their role in gender liberation. Not to mention, the face of gender and sexual deviance is white, skinny, and passing. Like, come on, we are literally trans. Let‚Äôs get creative.

Two spirit is identified as LGBTQ because of the normalization of heterosexuality‚Äîbut ‚ÄúLGBTQ‚Äù is a really watered down, *appropriative* way of regarding the two spirit identity. But people are barely talking about that because cultural appropriation, which is (at the level of critical race studies) a social force that erases the narratives of people of color and replaces them with white colonial interpretations at the expense of the ***humanity*** of poc, transforms into a conversation about aesthetics on social media.

It kind of reminds me of school, where people only speak up when they think they know the answer, and not to ask questions. In the USA, it‚Äôs really awkward to be wrong, we are not taught how to be incorrect with grace, and a lot of folks rely on being right and looking smart for validation. Social media has become a kind of performance ground where if it looks like you‚Äôre pushing the envelope in thinking, you receive validation. 

But people who don‚Äôt read don‚Äôt know when an analysis is practically BS.

Look, I know I‚Äôm coming across as a know-it-all. I don‚Äôt know how to speak up in these moments without looking this way. I don‚Äôt want to be the asshole who says ‚Äúread a book.‚Äù Not everyone has the ability to do that easily. I also believe that we don‚Äôt necessarily need to read in order to get this information and understand how these concepts show up in reality.

But I definitely do believe that the way we approach knowledge building in pop culture, in social media, contributes to the spreading of (mis)information‚Äîa lot of this information by gender/sexual dissident/poc‚Äîand that if each of us personally does truly care about liberation, we NEED to do more than interact with takes on social media.

804,New Rules and Content Guidelines Discussion,"Hey folks, 

The mod team has been somewhat out of commission for a little while ‚Äì other than basic maintenance the good ship LSGB has been fairly rudderless for the last few months. Suffice to say we‚Äôve all been making more of an effort to have a discussion about where the sub‚Äôs going and where we might want it to go.

 We‚Äôre wanting to put forth a few new rules as well as some content requirements that might improve the overall quality of this subreddit and make a more active community of sorts.

**Everything posted here is open for discussion** ‚Äì please let us know what you think of these rules or if you have any other suggestions for rules or content.

**New rule: No Meta-Posts**

We already have a rule pertaining to metaposts in other subreddits, but we want to expand it to include posts about other subreddits in here, whether leftist or not. This kind of content is usually fairly low-quality, feeds into pointless Reddit drama, and creates false rivalries. 

**New rule: No Exclusionary Content**

There‚Äôs a wide variety of people on this subreddit. Trans women, trans men, nonbinary, genderfluid, agender, etc. Do not make posts that generalize the entirety of this subreddit as one thing. Trans Reddit generally has a problem of being focused on the transfemme experience. This is a place for everyone outside of the cis binary. Keep this in mind when contributing. 

**Content Requirements**

We‚Äôve seen a lot of pretty terrible, low-quality content posted on here as the sub has grown, and we really don‚Äôt have any guidelines other than being about trans and/or leftist shit. We‚Äôve put together some basic content guidelines that will hopefully increase the quality of submissions.

1. **Is it a joke?** Not a relatable situation, or a post to validate someone, or a comment on something that's been posted in a capitalism-loving sub, but an actual joke. This is a meme sub, after all.

2. **Is it about gender?** Whether it be trans/nonbinary specific or just having a laugh at weird gender norms. Needs to include something about gender.

3. **Is it from a leftist perspective?** Equally as important as gender. Needs to have both to be in this sub. If it could just be posted in a general trans sub it probably doesn't belong here. 

If your content doesn‚Äôt follow these three guidelines, it will be removed. The distinction between *shitposts* and *shitty posts* is somewhat fine but it exists. More effort is always appreciated. Try to make some fresh content, there's a lot more to this than slapping an overdone joke on an overused image macro. 

Let us know what you think of these rules/guidelines in the comments or if you have suggestions for other ways the sub could be improved. Thanks! 

EDIT: After some discussion it seems there isn't any real opposition to any of the proposed changes. The new rules and content guidelines have been formalized.

So close, but you missed the mark.\n\n*All* cis and and binary trans people [I'm excluding non-binary trans people because I just don't know enough about their experiences to speak with any authority‚Äîy'all are valid] experience the same pressure to conform to the same standards of masculinity and femininity. Men are pressured to be more masculine. Women are pressured to be more feminine. Same for cis and trans people. There's a contradiction between society's expectations and our own authenticity. Gay cis men are seen as less manly. If a man talks about his emotions, he's told to man up. If he throws a ball poorly, he's told he throws like a girl.\n\nBasically, the contradiction between society and personal authenticity is not unique to trans people, and does not require creating a whole new theory of gender in order to make trans people valid.\n\nI, as a trans woman, suffer from a lot of the same societal expectations as cis trans women. To be pretty, to be fashionable, etc. But as AMAB, there's different kinds of pressure about my body. It's not just about fat, but it's also about hiding my penis, and pretending I have boobs, and hoping my voice passes, etc. It's different because I'm trans, but it's the same idea.\n\nAll that being said, this theory of gender is not yet capable of explaining why the hell I'm transitioning. Obviously, it has to do with dysphoria, both anatomical and social. But how can this theory of gender account for the fact that some people have dysphoria? This has been the biggest question I've been dealing with ever since I started transitioning. Why do some people born AMAB feel validated when they wear dresses and high heels? It's not a biological phenomenon, because gender expression varies from culture to culture. High heels used to be masculine. It's nothing innate about the nature of dresses and the individual, but it's the social value that society gives to dresses. I don't know where to take it from there. I'm not trained in philosophy, feminism, gender studies, or anything close. But the theory needs to be taken to its limits to provide validation for trans people.\n\nThis started out as a critique of Contrapoints. She's a very intelligent and very creative person. I personally just have an axe to grind with her for failing to go far enough in her theory of gender, stopping short of something coherent, succumbing to holding two contradictory theories in an effort to validate trans people, as if the second theory is the only way to validate trans people."", 'I thought r/chapotraphouse was the official contrapoints sub', '[deleted]', 'subbed, thanks for this ', ""if contrapoints is so good, why isn't there a contrapoints 2?"", ""I've been on fuckthealtright for a long time, and have trouble believing that they're fascists.

959,Being trans is NOT a fetish,"Fetishism embodies all of the worst aspects of leftist culture. It's reactive, sexualizing identity politic which focuses it's goals on resisting the opposition rather than building a movement or liberating people. In leftist politics there's a concept of prefiguration, in which we "" ""build a new world in the shell of the old"". This in in contrast to attempts to justify the means with the ends. Even if widespread fetishism really resulted in a more liberated society, does that justify the sexualization of minors, oppression of women and the fetishization of trans people that has taken place along the way? In my mind we overlook offensive aspects of our culture and communities much too often, reasoning that doing so might make us look ""conservative"", just because a conservative would oppose it. It's a fear-based enforcement mechanism which values social aesthetics over materialism and grants broad power to bad actors under the guise of sexual liberation.

The queer counter-culture of the 80s mirrors that of revolutionary france, during which sedition and grotesque pornographic caricatures were used as tools to undermine authoritarian control. Before her execution, Marie Antoinette was stripped, bound at the neck, humiliated and accused of incest. Compare this to her husband, who was only symbolically bound in a handkerchief and charged for his political betrayal. Fast forward to today where leftists are saying pro-lifers deserve rape and anarchists are distributing nude sculptures of Trump, balless.

There's a difference between sexualization and sexuality. Sexual freedom, sexuality and sexual expression are good things. Sexualization happens when something non-sexual such as an article of clothing, an object, or the color of someone's skin is socially assigned a sexual aspect.  The point of contention arises because, sometimes, sexualization and sexuality are embodied or expressed simultaneously. Being genuinely aroused by something does not give people a free pass on scrutinizing it's harmful social effects.

I love my trans and nonbinary community. I really do. It pains me every time I hear trans women talk about how they only want to date str8, c1s men for the affirmation. It pains me every time I hear about transmascs with a ""thing"" for misogynistic degradation. It disgusts me to hear about how commonplace dd/lg shit is. It's frustrating every time someone sexualizes femininity and girlhood and women and ESPECIALLY trans women.
