I do not support US involvement in the issue by pinning the Wuhan Flu on China as an ""act of war"" because the US was behind it to begin with. However, were China to make the first move of an invasion (which would be a logistical nightmare), US defense of Taiwan becomes more justified.\nI don\'t get this at all. Doesn\'t China basically own US leadership? Biden?

The EO forced the nursing homes to immediately take them back, spreading the virus among the most vulnerable and quickly climbing the CNN Covid death counter up.\n\n\nThe goal was to create a first impression among the public that this new virus, in March 2020 after declaring the pandemic emergency, was very deadly (it wasn't).\n\n\nThe Covid death rate went up in the weeks following and that was the basis for the belief that it was a deadly virus. Same thing in Italy's nursing homes that was used as proof of a high death rate for everybody of all age groups (it wasn't). Returning infected patients into nursing homes early on was key. The Covid death counter doesn't tell you the age.\n\n\nThe hospital protocols: in March 2020 Dr Fauci put Remdesivir as the only possible threatment, and later attack the safe and well known HCQ.

Where are the other 11 tribes descended from Jacob/Israel, and are they not part of the Old Testament chosen?\n\nAs I understand it, there were originally the 12 tribes (Or arguably 11 tribes plus 2 half tribes, Joseph seems to have some weird stuff going on the way they seem to break his tribe in half from the beginning).\nThe thing is that a lot of the Old Testament could be jokingly subtitled ""How the Jews done goofed"". Despite being God\'s chosen people, they had a habit for messing up and turning their back on the very God that chose them. Even so much that immediately after the death of Solomon (who despite all his wisdom had wives and concubines out the wazoo and allowed them to lead him astray) the kingdom of Israel broke in two, the kingdoms of Judah (primarily centered around the tribe of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin getting allied in there as well), and the kingdom of Israel (consisting of most everyone else).\nLevi is a unique case here since the Levites were the official \'priest\' tribe, and so would have kind of been split between the two but not have an official sub-nation of their own.\nGoing further onward, the back and forth between repenting and sinning meant that God gradually allowed foreign nations to tear the kingdoms of Israel and Judah apart. Eventually, both were conquered entirely, though in Israel\'s case the conquerors scattered the survivors across their empire to basically render them a non-entity. That basically wiped out everyone except Judah-Judah, Benjamin, and some of the Levites.\nSo while Judah was conquered as well, they weren\'t scattered the same way the larger kingdom of Israel was, allowing them to maintain a general ethnic and culture cohesion and - more importantly - a family through line that allowed Jesus to be born with a legitimate claim to behind descended from King David himself.\nAnd because of Israel itself being wiped out and leaving behind the Kingdom of Judah, I think that\'s why there was a larger general shift to referring to the Israelites more as Jews. There\'s even references to the term Jew in some of the later books of the Old Testament, in particularly the book of Esther.\n', '\nGood comment, thanks!\n', '\nJews are 0.25% of world population but control what percent of the world‚Äôs most influential and far-reaching media‚Ä¶ 75%?\nAnd the world media are pushing the gay and trans agenda, not to mention clot shots, global warming, war and communism.\nYou want to claim victimhood for Jews without addressing this extremely serious issue with the very group you want to associate yourself with!\nA person can notice these things without being called an angry anti-Semite.

The first crime was the bio weapon research and release\n\nIf there was a bioweapon, it was so ineffective as to have been laughable. Oh no! China took your friends\' sense of smell, how will the nation ever recover?\nThe infection mortality rate was the same as the flu. All cause mortality was the same as the flu. Oh and the flu ""vanished"" while there was covid.\n\nI made no such claim. In fact, I never even said the word China in my comment. You are imagining an argument that didn\'t even happen. Are you delusional?\n\nThe cabal is gearing up for war with China over Taiwan (and over China\'s support for Russia in Ukraine) and this is the first propaganda wave. If you fall for it, you\'re as gullible as those falling for the ""war with Russia right meow"" people.\n\nChina covered up the release of the bioweapon. That doesn\'t prove that the CCP released it, but it does lay great suspicion as to why they would cover up for it.\n\nNo, they covered up the fact that it was a flu from the very beginning. Remember their ""leaked"" propaganda videos of people dropping dead on the street? Don\'t tell me you think that was real?\nThe payload was the vaxx. That\'s when death rates started to climb to where they are now (higher than at any time during the ""bioweapon"" release).\n\nIs your view of the world so simple that you don\'t think the CCP could have simultaneously been allowing the labs to work gain of function AND to have been taken advantage of as the scape goat by those who released it?\n\nMy view of the world is that better parties than the CCP (US mil, vatican, germans, soviets) have tried and failed to make a viable bioweapon. I don\'t believe China managed to do it and the stats support me. All cause mortality was flat year over year until the vaxx came out. The vaxx was the payload.\n\nThey very well could have either agreed or been ignorant to the release of the weapon. Doesn\'t change the fact that the epicenter of the start of covid occurred in Wuhan.\n\nThere was no epicentre. The propaganda (to coerce people into taking the experimental vaxx) began in Wuhan with those fake ass videos. You do think they were real, don\'t you? Oof.\n\nBurden of proof is on the one making the claim. Your claim is that all cause mortality remained the same and thus proves that covid isn\'t real because no one extra died because of it. No, all the all cause mortality remaining level proves is that covid was no more deadly than the flu,\n\nIf it was as deadly as the flu, we would have seen deaths from the flu, AND deaths from covid. All cause mortality would have gone up. Where did the flu go?\n', ""\nI would need to consult a 'logical fallacy' table to list all the crimes against rational thinking you've committed above.\nYou not only didn't argue or dispute what I actually said, you're imagining arguments that I'm not making. I haven't survived the last 3 years of psychological warfare to fall for such low energy bullshit that reads like a stupid false flag fed fan-fic.\nThis is a hilarious wrong line of thinking:\n\nIf it was as deadly as the flu, we would have seen deaths from the flu, AND deaths from covid\n\nNo dude, that's not how that works at all, but nice try. The PCR tests were laughably wrong, so we don't know how many people actually died due to the flu vs covid. That still doesn't prove that covid didn't exist.\nIf the flu and covid are equally deadly in a population of 100 people, when a person dies of the flu...they can't die again due to covid. Conversely, if someone dies due to covid, they cannot die again from the flu.\nAll cause mortality is simply an indicator, not proof.\n"", '\nHow the hell is Fauci not in prison?\n', '\nThe government is too protected in peacetime.\n', '\nDeep state created it and released it on the world.

So I started every interview telling them that I'm not vaccinated, lets not waste each other's time, if that's cool and you allow an exemption process we can continue, and if not, bye. Got hired, initially took a pay cut, but they were cool with me being unvaccinated and didn't even require the exemption process. Fast forward several months, I changed to another company that required the vax (better pay, better hours, less stress). Told them straight up that I'm not getting it. They said they allowed exemptions (from what I heard they were rarely approved). I told them I will only leave my current job and go with them if I have, in writing, that my exemption is approved before I make the switch. Some phone calls were made, paper work submitted...received the approval email. Now I'm making more than I did before the initial vax mandate in 2021, I have better hours, a less stressful job, time off to enjoy with friends and family. Couldn't be happier with where I'm at.\nI think overall, during this process, you need to be confident and clear with recruiters and employers. I'm sure it was HR that fired you because they really don't care about the results of the company, the job, or you. They only care about woke and personal agendas they have. I would bet your supervisor was not happy about it and was against the termination, they wanted you for your performance and you were the best candidate after all. That last part is valuable and you should be confident knowing that in your career pursuits. You are the best candidate and this is why you were initially hired.\nLastly, this site and the people here were a great help and inspiration when I first started this too.

But the tradition of St. Nicholas is interesting because it really tows the line.\nLet\'s assume St. Nick was a real person and that he gave out gifts to those who were needy. Why is he celebrated on Jesus\'s birthday? Why not celebrate St. Nick in February when the weather is the dreariest?

Do you give gifts to your kids? Do you give gifts to the needy? When you give the gifts to the needy, who do you say it comes from? They will think it\'s coming from Santa Claus, the pagan diety of pagan Holiday Season. Is that really glorifying God if they believe the blessings are coming from the celebration of Santa Claus?\nChristians really need to consider what they are doing with St. Nick. Most Christians these days have no understanding of paganism, and they have trouble distinguishing the difference between Christianity and paganism. And even if they can, they have no concern for the threats of encroaching paganism in their lives. Most Christians have forgotten how angry God gets when His followers combine God\'s laws with pagan laws. It\'s all in Isaiah and Jeremiah. We have the perfect husband/companion in Jesus. Does it make sense to flirt with fake dieties? If your spouse got jealous of the attention you gave to someone else, how would you reply? Would you tell your spouse: ""don\'t worry, we\'re just friends. It doesn\'t mean anything to me""? Or would you tell your spouse: ""okay, I\'m sorry, I will stop acting that way to that other person""?

They want more government so they complain when its used against them. Like it always inevitably is.\n"", ""\nYou shouldn't. However, I think it's fair to note the circumstances of that contract are somewhat coercive and deceptively presented. Further, they're presented to young adults who don't necessarily appreciate the value of the years of their life that they're mortgaging or the sheer size of those numbers involved. Parents may help, but they overvalue the education because they're accustomed to the old status quo, that is, that a college education was a golden ticket worth paying for.\nI think there's a very fair argument that in many cases, what occurs with a college degree is a sales fraud.\nWe've all heard it. You go to college thinking that it'll get you a job and a career that'll put you up for life, but that's not what you get at all. You get a very expensive piece of paper that trades on the reputation of generations of students before who came out of a far more rigorous program than is being sold currently. The current generation is asked to take out 50-60K/year to learn how to be Marxist activists, racists, and sexual deviants. They're not taught how to think. They're taught to memorize what the professor wants them to and to repeat it. They're taught not to think because divergent thinking is ruthlessly punished. Students are sold an education, but that's NOT what they receive. It's a sales fraud.\nSo the question then becomes who is liable. The government took over and manages the student loan program, but it's a public-private thing. Private banks are the primary lenders. So the ones ultimately responsible are the universities. And good luck holding them accountable. They've got lawyers just like everyone else and they'll show contracts that show what you paid for was access to this and that, but not necessarily to results. It's hard to prove fraud here because few universities actually promise you'll be more intelligent or wise, and if they did, there's very little objective measures to prove that was actually delivered.\n"", ""\nI've long thought that the schools should go on the hook for loan defaults. If their graduates can't generate enough societal value to pay back a degree, they would have to reconsider their pricing and programming.\nFurthermore, schools should be self-funding the loans themselves. Either via endowment or borrowing on the open market.\n"", '\nAgree. The universities have become bloated with too much bureaucracy and too many amenities. They have forgotten their primary mission which is to educate and hopefully prepare graduates to become productive members of society.\n', '\nExactly right. And while this bullshit shouldn\'t even be on the table at all, the idea that this could be proposed with no proposal as to how to put a stop to the bullshit going forward is just stupid.\nThe American working man is overdue for saying ""enough"".\n', ""\nThat very fair argument then opens up a similarly fair argument. If we ought to relieve outstanding debt on the grounds that these students were sold a fraudulent bill of goods, then weren't students who graduated without debt or who have since repaid their loans also sold the same fraudulent bill of goods? If yes, then are they not also entitled to financial recompenance?\n"", ""\nPerhaps, but some degree programs and student counseling programs are more fraudulent than others. Treating them all as equal would bankrupt good schools alongside the bad. If we really had the option, I'd bankrupt the bad ones on principle, based primarily on their unemployable graduates.\nIt's not realistically going to happen when that wasn't a term of past loans, but moving forward, we sure as hell should make the schools liable for future student loans that cannot be paid. That would put a stop to this nonsense relatively quickly...not as quick as it should, because public schools are also taxpayer-funded, but it'd still help.\n"", ""\nMake schools mandatory co-signers on all student loans? I like that idea.\nIf we're going to argue that students should be responsible for all their decisions, then we certainly should expect the institutions that have benefited from this ridiculous student loan system to be responsible for who they admit.\n"", ""\nI whole heartedly disagree. You're just begging people to spend 4 years studying nothing then another 10 with their feet up at the end of the bill. The answer, as always,is to get the government out of it. Guaranteed loans are the sole mechanism that allowed all of these problems. It introduces a perverse incentive into the exchange. Adding yet another federally mandated perverse incentive against the first one is only going to exacerbate the problem.\n"", '\nI agree that guaranteed loans caused the problem. Ideally, we\'d get rid of the guaranteed loans in the first place, but it\'s a far steeper political hurdle than forcing the universities to put skin into the game as an intermediate step. (It\'s an intermediate step toward phasing them out too, because once the universities have to guarantee the loans instead of the government, it puts competing collateral-based lenders on more equal footing.)\nBarring a total end to the loans, how does making the schools co-sign the loan add another perverse incentive? It seems to me that it adds that correct incentive by putting some liability in the hands of the other beneficiary party...the one more likely to actually make rational self-interested long-term decisions than 18-year-old retards whose counselors are universally lying to them based on guidelines that came down from the beneficiary universities in the first place.\nWe can let the students bear all of the negative consequences of a system deliberately designed to benefit the universities, and we\'ll get two seconds of schadenfreude seeing them realize their own stupidity, ""because fuck you, that\'s why,"" but it\'s the slowest way to fix the actual problem. It\'s potentially going to take a lot more failed generations to teach 18-year-olds lessons from other people\'s mistakes than it would take for university risk management teams to cut worthless degrees from a system they colluded with government to design for their own benefit. (Maybe the students should know better, but I\'m more inclined to maximally stick it to institutional fraudsters than entitled asshole kids, especially when it cuts closer to the root problem faster. Plus, holding institutions accountable over useful idiots does a lot more to attack the heart of our enemy\'s power.)\n', ""\nEnding guaranteed loans from the government would stop all of that tomorrow. It's a far better forward-looking solution that what you're proposing there. Quit trying to grow the government.\n"", '\nI already agreed that ending guaranteed loans is a better solution, if we had a free choice in solution. You don\'t need to convince me about that.\nThe issue is, we\'re not going to realistically go from 60 to 0 in one step here. You can insist on an all or nothing approach until you\'re blue in the face, but you will suffocate before the politicians even think about moving on it, and also before the public is willing to stomach it. It\'s political suicide to attack the loans directly at this stage in the game, but it\'s politically viable to choke out the racket until it dies from free market competition...and then doing what you want just becomes the path of least resistance and a formality.\nRealistically speaking, the intermediate solution does two things with respect to the size of government:\n\nIt makes the government actually exercise its legitimate libertarian role to define and prosecute fraud. Instead, it currently exists to systematically perpetuate a racket in collusion with quasi-private and quasi-public entities who are by no means innocent of this deliberate collusion. If you really think the status quo is a ""smaller government"" scenario than actually defining the collusion as fraud with the intermediate solution requiring schools (typically government schools anyway...) to co-sign these loans that shouldn\'t even exist but do exist for their benefit, I think your sense of proportion is off here.\nRealistically speaking, it will drastically reduce the number of government-backed loans, especially the unpayable ones, which will overall shrink the integral of government intervention.\n\n', '\nSchools and even professors themselves have to be held liable. It was the schools themselves that shafted these kids. They took their money then spat out unemployable angry illiterates with worthless degrees. It borders on child abuse or consumer fraud. Maybe this should be called the subprime education loan crisis.\nThese schools should pay for their worthless indoctrination, not us.\n', '\nAlso understand that EVERYONE that they were conditioned to trust: teachers, counselors, authorities, even their stupid boomer parents, all of them betrayed that trust by scamming them into these debilitating loans. It\'s hard to fault someone for not overcoming 18 years of CONSTANT indoctrination of ""Go to college at any cost or be a loser.""\nOn the other hand, the left\'s position on this is completely incoherent. You must believe either:\n\n\nThat the entire student loan system is coercive and predatory, in which case, while debt cancellation could be on the table, the MOST important step would be to first abolish the entire thing.\n\n\nThat the student loan program is necessary and should continue, in which case the loans, therefore, are entirely legitimate.\n\n\n', '\nIn a country that adheres to law and order through blind justice, sure.

I ended up avoiding this area where the house was, for where they were all housed, after one of them followed me into the fields on a bicycle‚Ä¶shortly after, all 10 of them disappeared,\nI had moved to Germany, from the UK, where there is sadly predominantly Pakistani Muslim controlled areas in England, especially in places like In London and the North of England, called Bradford. I had encountered a horrible Pakistani couple, who were my neighbours, in what is called a semi-detached house. This horrible little man, would beat up regularly, his cousin, whom he had married, as the Pakistani families tend to intermarry, to keep the money in the family‚Ä¶ the downside is there is major genetic problems, with the children born of these unions, which is a constant drain on the National Health Service in the UK, which no one will talk about.. and then there is the problem of the Pakistani grooming gangs, which for at least 20 years, the Police refused to address‚Ä¶ but I digress‚Ä¶\nIncidentally, my horrible wife beater neighbour bought a Àãcute‚Äò‚Äò completely white kitten for his wife, for Christmas 15 years ago‚Ä¶\nBy July, I came downstairs one morning to find their white juvenile cat, with 3 kitten, through my kitchen window, sitting on the roof of my shed which was adjoined to my house.\nI was surprised at how the cat managed to get her three kittens onto this shed roof, but I found a piece of wood so that they could get down to the lawn. Fortunately, I had the day off, as I was flying to Germany the next weekend‚Ä¶ I returned home, and they were still there..and at around 11.00 p.m. took them reluctantly into my home‚Ä¶.because the foxes were about‚Ä¶\nSince that point, our destiny‚Äòs become intertwined, after much wrangling with my Pakistani neighbours, they finally assigned custody of the now adult cat and her 3 kittens to me‚Ä¶\nI then had the expense of vet bills of neutering all four of them, vaccinating them all for pet passports, and moving them all over to Germany‚Ä¶but I still have my 4 girls, who this year will now reach 16/15 years old. As I type this the Mother cat sits with me purring, as her and her girls have had a great life, surrounded by fields, as I now live in a rural area, with views across fields with horses, and the Odenwald mountains in the distance, which I never take for granted, coming originally from the city of Nottingham in the UK, although my house in the UK does have amazing views across this city.\nAnyway, seeing these stupid women, holding up signs, stating ÀãRefugees Welcome‚Äò, I thought Àãyou have no idea of what you are welcoming in‚Äò. I had spent years, talking to these Pakistani taxi drivers, and understand their warped mindset, which basically. Is that they all consider all Western and American, women as nothing but hoars to be used, abused and discarded. This is their mindset‚Ä¶like the Afghans (who are the worst)‚Ä¶ But I would like to point out that this does not include the Arab or Turkish Muslim people, who are so lovely, which I have encountered in the Middle East, on my travels.\nWhilst visiting the Italian Alps, I had a conversation with one of my German friends, and voiced my concerns, about the then influx of refugees under the Markel Regine, had stated that we could do this‚Ä¶ This was in October, when my friend disagreed with me, thinking that Markel was doing Àãa good thing‚Äò. I argued the contrary, as it would have categoric consequences for German society, as it had for the UK‚Ä¶\nThen on New Years Eve everything changed for the peoples in Germany, as there was the HUGE incident in Cologne, where these migrants, not only from Syria, but from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Africa, tried to not only set fire to the ancient K√∂ln Cathedral undergoing restoration, surrounded by wooden scaffolding at the time, but there many reported sexual assaults on German women this night, as which had also happened throughout the whole of Europe, this New Years night.\nFast forward 6 months later, we were with our friend, who happened to be staying with us, had been a staunch supporter of Merkel‚Äòs refugee program‚Ä¶.\nWe visited a ruined castle in the city of Drachenfels, in the Odenwald area, and we saw two Muslim women draped from head to foot totally in black, with their faces also covered, with their children‚Ä¶and Stephan, upon seeing them uttered the words, which I have to say did shocked me, saying Àãblo@@dy f@cking Mus@lims!\nThe events of New Year‚Äòs Eve, was a wake up call for some Germans, but sadly most are still asleep, as to our planned replacement in the west, under the Kaligari plan.\nWell that is my perspective from Europe, which is coming to you fast from Biden‚Äòs current southern open border policy, and the recent revealations currently unfolding of Katie Hobbs‚Äòs, and others in Government and your Judicial system being compromised in connection with being bought and sold to the Mexican Cartels, which does not surprise me.\nAll the best from Germany :-)\n', '\nMen are evil.\n', '\nYes.

Actually just found this article backing my memory - in the huff post of all places...!!!\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-rumsfeld-and-the-s_b_805581\n', ""\nSugar in it's various forms have been consumed by humans for millennia. The others, not so much.\n"", ""\nAnd sugar has been causing obesity, diabetes, and a host of other diseases for just as long.\nBack in the year 1800, the Average American consumed 4 lbs of sugar per person annually. Currently, it's about 57 lbs per American.\nThat's a hint in relation to our current obesity issues.\n"", '\nExcess sugar is pretty easily avoided if you prepare your own food and follow the plate rules for leafy greens, fat and protein ahead of starchy food.\nFolks who eat processed foods and suck on sweetened drinks are risking their health.\n', '\nI agree 100%.\n', ""\nI agree with you about White Sugar, but you must also consider other crap, Like Corn Syrup, and Cane Syrup, which is what gave my Father Diabetes....\nAnd yet, Brown Sugar and pure Maple Syrup seem to be much safer products, probably because they aren't Processed....\nI love the Flavors, so that's what I try to get, it does seem to help, and the energy seems to last longer, and is more balanced too....\n"", ""\n\nprobably because they aren't Processed\n\nuh‚Ä¶ say what? All sugar is ‚Äòprocessed‚Äô\n"", '\nThat would make consumption the issue not sugar.\n', ""\nThe amount of consumption is the bulk of the problem, a big part of it. Then you add HFCS, which is processed in the liver and is as destructive to the body as cancer if enough is consumed consistently.\nThat process builds a fatty liver, similar to drinking alcohol excessively, which ironically is sugar itself.\nEating an orange is not that big of a deal. Eating twenty a day is. Water is good, and necessary for life... unless you drink a gallon in 15 minutes. If you drink a gallon of water in just a few minutes, your brain will swell, and you'll die quickly.\nSugar is and is not the issue; it's the amount, type, and how often sugar is consumed daily. HFCS is basically weaponized sugar.\nCane sugar in its original form is not as bad as processed sugar. Same with salts. There are patterns.\nWhen I was a young man, a common phrase stated daily by adults to children across the board: All things in moderation. I've found this to be true.\nNearly half of U.S. adults, 48%, report drinking at least one glass of soda per day, with soda drinkers averaging 2.6 glasses daily. That's a lot of HFCS and added calories.\nYou can keep your eating window to 8 hours a day and eat/drink sweet substances in that period daily with little to no negative effect. It's a matter of how often you spike your insulin levels consistently, and fructose is no different but processed in the liver instead of insulin.\nYou get the same effect if you eat an excess of starchy foods and even carbs in general.\nDiabetes and its subsequent weight gain can be dealt with easily by not spiking insulin levels all day, every day.\nI can explain the processes involved if you'd like.\n"", '\nThey all died tho.\n', '\nCommon sense?\nVader kneels\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n', '\nDonald Rumsfeld has left the chat\n', '\nBoth are human creations, so not trustworthy.

Sugar is not converted into fat. Eating fat does not cause heart attacks. Arterial blockages are the body's attempt to repair the damage done by oxidation which is caused by carbs/sugars.\nThe body will ALWAYS burn the sugar (glucose) first if both are available. In that case, that fat will be stored for later. You keep eating both and that is why you will get fat.\nCut the carbs and sugar and the body will go for the fat for energy. You can lose the fat with this way of eating.\n"", ""\nThus I said if a person is overly sedentary and doesn't burn the fat. Of course cutting sugar isn't the only or even most effective way to cut fat but no one said that it was.\n"", '\nYes to most, but sugar does directly fuel fat production through lipogenesis.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogenesis\n', '\n100% correct.\n', '\nEverything you eat (fats, protein, carbohydrates) can be converted to fat in the body.\n', ""\nexercise being linked to weight is one of the biggest lies the food industry pushed on us.

I\'m talking about people who are trying to ""fix"" something that doesn\'t need to be fixed. I\'m not talking deteriorated joints or stem cell therapy or whatever you\'re talking about. I\'m referring to people who undergo unnecessary surgeries because they want to look like a cat or a chick that\'s addicted to getting her tits to enormous proportions when she already has nice tits or someone who wants a few of their fingers removed. Yeah, money is definitely an incentive, what I\'m saying is that, at some point, I think it must go beyond money for some of these people because it strays into the realm of mutilation and harm which doctors and surgeons with a healthy and right brain should decline to do, no matter how much money is on the line.\n', '\nNot old enough for vapes but we will make you an ""it""\n', ""\nNor old enough to drink, which is sad because after the realization of what you've done sinks in you will want to start drinking.\n"", '\nHonest question here: whats the money situation when it comes to these sorts of treatments and surgeries?

Many folks who have had the ""bottom"" surgeries have reported lots of complications and having to go back several times.\nHormone shots have to be taken for the lifetime of the patient or their body will revert to it\'s natural state.

Like a know-it-all brat on steroids, the correct answer keeps changing so them can say, ""actually...""\n', '\n100% this.\nI can still remember the earliest example of hearing about this shit actually happening. It was back around like.. maybe 2013, 2014, I\'m probably getting the dates wrong but it\'s been a minute. I do remember it was close to when Jordan Peterson was first getting famous for that incident where he initially got filmed telling people he wouldn\'t use their pronouns.\nI can still still remember where I was at when I heard this nonsense, too, and exactly what I was listening to. I was driving at work and had my truck radio on NPR because I still listened to them back then.\nThey had this college on there who were all concerned about this growing issue with students demanding their gender identity be accepted, and the example they gave was this recent student who was ""gender fluid"".\nThey were discussing how this student had come out as a different gender, and all of the faculty and staff had been instructed to call them by whatever pronouns it was they had identified with. That part wasn\'t really the issue for them.\nThe problem they had, though, that they were actually complaining about to NPR and surprisingly AT THE TIME even NPR was complaining and acting surprised about it, was the fact that this student would change their ""pronouns"" on whims at random times, and so rapidly nobody would be able to keep up.\nLiterally this person would be having a conversation with you and expect you to be able to know that they\'d have changed their pronouns 7 times in the course of a single paragraph.\nAnd they were making official complaints against the school because they didn\'t recognize this, and the school was freaking out not knowing how to accomodate it.\nI can still remember sitting there just shaking my head knowing that there was only TWO distinct possibilities here. Either this person was extremely, extremely mentally ill at which point they shouldn\'t even be in school in the first place and should be under intensive care of certified professionals, or if that\'s not the case:\nThen they were intentionally exerting power over their teachers/school in a way of showing ""look what I can do to you, I can use this gender ideology to disrupt the learning environment in such an extreme way that I can literally demand you to know what my pronouns are every THREE SECONDS and cause such a problem for you that you\'ll go to NPR radio and complain about it""\nAnd there lies the real problem. As you pointed out, it\'s a fucking power-play issue. IT\'s a game of showing how much influence you have over another person by being willing to actually stoop to those levels.\nMost people are too polite and courteous to actually go low enough to say, seriously, that their pronouns are ""Attack Helicopter"" especially in a professional and serious setting, and then stir up shit demanding people use that pronoun. But the way the gender ideology has shaken out, if you DO stoop that low, it basically demands that people turn themselves into fucking CLOWNS to suit your needs.\nI would NEVER call someone an attack helicopter, because I\'m not stupid. I\'m not a clown. I know that a human being is not an attack helicopter. But their goddamned ideology demands that you do, and if you dont, their outrage mob will destroy your career.\nSo someone wanting to extert power and influence, can threaten your career if you don\'t turn yourself into a clown.\nThat\'s a pretty big power play, if your\'e willing to stoop to that level and be that kind of piece of shit.\n', ""\nit's exactly this. it's a tactic used by cults to keep people in a submissive role. no matter what, you're always doing something wrong, so you must atone to make it up to them.\nit's the same technique they use with accusations of racism... move out of the city and that's white flight, you racist bigot. move into the city and that's gentrification, you racist bigot. no matter what, you're racist, so bend the knee or be shamed!\n"", '\nDilbert Dude was right!\n', '\nAgreed, more of a narcissistic thing...\n', '\nIn 2014, my daughter was 12 and told me that HALF of her class was either bi or trans. She told me that it was the ""cool"" thing to do.\nWe pulled her within 2 weeks. It was the single issue that opened my eyes. I took the horse-blinders off and started paying attention. I voted for Obama, twice, because I was naive and listened to left-wing media. I\'m sorry. I wish I could take it back. I voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 and never looked back. I wish I had paid attention when I was younger, but I now see and understand all of the corruption.\nThe dems (and some RINOS) have been programming people forever. The only way the dems will ever win is if they are guaranteed votes. They do this by manipulating our youth and ensuring they hold all the playable cards. This is why I helped with local grassroots campaigns to get conservative school board members elected, and we were very successful!\nThe mental poisoning of our youth begins with parents letting the government schools raise their kids.\nThe indoctrination has been ongoing for a very long time and more people need to take off the horse-blinders before it is too late.\n', '\nWoke is a mental disease...\n', '\nThis cultural phenomenon is not sustainable for more than a couple more years max.

Then only store bought can come in.\nI am not saying that it isn‚Äôt serious for some. But enforcing your life on everyone is not the way. Personal responsibility is t the only way. Teachers are lazy. I am a nuclear engineer and after I retired I tried to substitute teach and toon a teacher aid role. Wanting to hell kids.

And she told me no, that wasn\'t the point, that it was really about making life as uncomfortable and confusing as possible for everyone they could involve in their self obsessed little games.

That's why.\n"", '\nNot true. More bullshit you\'re being told.\nIt\'s unconstitutional for one congress to encumber another congress with spending appropriations. Just think about it, if they could the Dems last year would have written the federal budgets for the next several centuries.\nIt\'s a con. Like Biden\'s student debt scam. Except with that bill they got the GOP senate to sign off on it. Still, Congress can go to court; refuse to fund other things the president needs; or refuse the whole debt raising plan or refuse to even acknowledge the existence of this scam.\nAlso, we very rarely pass a whole federal budget, congress passes ""continuing resolutions"" which are like say a credit card payment for every federal agency and department.

The fact it hasn't been as such, implies the Ukrainians lack the depth of capability to defend it as they did Azovstal.\nSecondly, Bakhmut is one of the last obstacles in the way of a clear run across Western Ukraine, and would probably force a withdrawal to the Dnieper (the N-S river that splits Ukraine into E-W halves) by Ukrainian forces if they don't want to be eradicated in a hunt across the steppe.\nThirdly, the kettling that Russia is carrying out is going to cost probably a Division or two of Ukrainian troops (killed or captured). So, there's incentive on both sides to either close the trap (Russian), or extract what people they can (Ukrainian). I don't care what magic numbers people throw about in terms of losses, losing a couple of divisions like that is going to hurt Ukrainian efforts.\nFourthly, after Bakhmut, there really isn't much in the way of Russia continuing to roll West and take Odessa. Almost all of the significant population centres in the South are in Russian hands, and Bakhmut is one of the few outside the Odessa region that Ukraine still holds.\nTo be honest, I don't know if Russia is that keen on a pursuit across the steppe, or to take Odessa and complete the landlocking of Ukraine. That may change with the recent drone attacks in and around Moscow.\nI wish there were some honest numbers about Ukrainian losses. There are suggestions that the standing military as at Dec 2021 has almost been completely eradicated, and what is fielded now is conscripts and reserves. And that what remains of the standing army is the first to be withdrawn from Soledar and Bakhmut in a desparate effort to preserve what skilled capability is left. That will also influence what and where Ukraine deploys their forces next.\n"", '\nFIne. But that describes the situation in Bakhmut. It is being encircled by the Russians much like Mariupol was. That is not ""typical"" for Ukrainian soldiers overall who are fighting throughout Ukraine- as your post suggest.\nPerhaps reporting on total casualties would provide more helpful insights into who has the upper hand. Right now the invaders are approaching 200,000 KIA. That is far more than the number of Ukrainians killed thus far.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/02/us/politics/ukraine-russia-casualties.html\nNone of this should be a surprise to anyone who understands that the Russian military doctrine calls for drowning its enemies in the blood of their peasant soldiers. That is what they have done for centuries, because human life has little value to Russian commanders. Just look at how these poorly trained conscripts are being sent out equipped with century old Mosin-Nagant bolt action rifles to charge into ranks of dug-in Ukrainian infantry. This is but one reason why the are destined to lose so badly.\n', ""\nUkraine's military keep shelling the civilians\n"", '\nThere are no civilians in Ukraine anymore\n', '\nI‚Äôm surprised putin hasn‚Äôt unleashed a nuke or two on Ukraine by now,the patience of this man against the satanic globalist cabal is astonishing\n', ""\nThe only reason he hasn't is, because: 1) he is a devout Christian man; 2) he sees, loves,and understands the good-hearted people of Europe and America etc.; 3) but he also sees the wickedness inside the Globalist Cabal oppressing them; 4) he wants Russia to become a Western civilization and join us.\nPutin blesses the Virgin Mary\n"", ""\nI assume that is because after all of the money he has stolen- he'd like to live long enough to enjoy it.

It very well may be bullshit, but you have no proof of that. In fact, everything is lining up against your statement. Show me any proof that the people who are conducting this war don\'t simply want to see it take as much human life as possible.\nWho\'s actions are actively trying to end this war? Because to me, it just looks like everyone (Yes, even Putin) have a vested interest in extending it.\n', '\nwhy would Russia want to destroy what it claims is its own territory and leave a nuclear wasteland in its own backyard?\nall of Europe would become unlivable\nPutin has an interest in ending it but he has to move slow because his own people are in the war zone\n', '\nWhy are you assuming Russia is the purveyor of the destruction I described above? Also, ""and leave a nuclear wasteland in its own backyard"" as if nukes are a foregone conclusion...they haven\'t dropped yet, doesn\'t mean they will. Though, it certainly isn\'t becoming less likely, it just hasn\'t happened yet.\nPutin may have an interest in gaining land (specifically, land that is occupied largely by pro-Russia citizens). However, it isn\'t always the case that increasing the geography of one\'s rulership will lead to a stronger rule (see the Romans extending their hand too far). Russia didn\'t even start this fight, since 2013 the Donbass region was shelled constantly by the corrupt to pull Putin into the war. (See the pro-Russian people above)\nHowever, Putin was smart in waiting to attack at a time when the US needed to keep up the perception of supporting this war. For every $1 Russia spends, the US spends more, deflating their currency and inflating his new BRICS money. Notice the curious timing, Putin had ample ""justification"" to roll troops into Ukraine since 2013, however he waited until after BRICS? I\'m not saying it is a certain causation, but the timing certainly is curious.\nThat being said, Putin is a dictator and he will fight for himself first always, it is only for now that his interest aligns with the people\'s. I have no doubt that should his motivations change, Putin would rather watch his fighting age male population sacrifice themselves on the alter for his continued tyranny.\nYou are not wrong, though that Putin has an interest in ending the war. However, he has a greater interest in prolonging it since he is gaining a large return on investment. The vacuum he is creating cannot help but be filled by the west, so the more he sucks, the more he gains. Even if the US has a military victory, it will not be worth the cost spent. Thus, Russia wins in exactly the way they need to, sacrifice a few soldiers and gain a stronger economy.\nThis is why the only war worth fighting is that which is for liberty. But the war for liberty is not being fought in Ukraine, it is simply a dictator fighting a....whatever the hell the US Government is...I can tell you what it is NOT, it is NOT ""we the people"".\nAnd this is how evil and Satan rule this world. It isn\'t always by having faithful followers in name sacrificing children on an alter to molch, though apparently that does happen. It is by weaving into the hearts of man desires that align only with their own best interests. In this way, what may have started as honest turns corrupt - or, more likely, what was never honest appears to be so at the outset and with time can no longer conceal it\'s corruption.\n""Evil"" wants nothing more than to watch souls burn and the world to suffer, it will come like a shining light for a time only to lure those deeper into it\'s trap. Once you see the foundation of the real power grapple in the world, it becomes much easier to see what isn\'t aligned with \'the good\'.\nAka, both God and evil want men\'s souls. However, God wants us only by free - that is freedom. Evil wants us any way they can have us, freely choosing evil or by total deception or honest ignorance...they\'re all sufficient.\nPutin has a right to fight the war and it makes total sense that the illegitimate US government would fund their opposition. However, there is little to nothing we US citizens can do about this struggle directly. The best we have to end the corruption afar is to fix it at home.\nOr as JBP says, clean up your room before you criticize society\'s failures. Not because you are necessarily wrong, but because you are so likely to make things worse. (Not saying you are wrong or that your room is dirty. I\'m just honestly responding the best I can to your line of questioning on the situation is Ukraine. With proper respect to the fact that I cannot possible know the full truth over there.

So they get off work at 6 and the school board meeting is on a weekday at 7.\nAnd these people don't have kids. So they can absolutely be there.\nIt's not about sportsball, it's scheduled intentionally.\n"", '\nThis is partly true. I\'ve been on the school board and my state\'s school board multiple times. In my experience, four types of people run for school board: 1) A parent that wants their kid to get special treatment or has a grievance over an extracurricular activity. I\'d argue at least 50% of school board candidates are That parent. They know their kid will get special treatment if they\'re on the school board because the superintendent\'s job depends on it. 2) Budding politicians that are trying to get their first elected office. but usually the political types run for City Council. The ones who run for school board are generally more stupid and more radical 3) a spouse of a teacher, retired teacher or retired school administrator. In my experience, about 25% of all school boards are married to someone in the school district or work/have worked for the school district. Most of them want to increase pay for teachers but say it\'s for the students. 4) An older retired person that is bored/ bored stay-at-home mom/ annoying drunks that are professional enough to do the modicum of work it takes to appear they got their shit together. This is much more common than people think. Usually, this shit doesn\'t fly on City Councils because take that more seriously since City\'s can raise taxes without voter approval. School boards by and large do not have that problem.\nIn New York and Chicago, the mayors are the superintendents of the school and the school boards are very weak because the cities run the schools. This is why Chicago and New York are the worst school districts. The mayors can just universally and unilaterally screw with the schools and so they do. Of course, it\'s always ""for the children"".\nIn studies, the number one predictor for how a school does in educating children is the socio economic breakdown of the neighborhood it\'s located in. Great school districts are located in areas where 90%+ of parents are married, have a job and hold conservative values and the majority of parents are college graduates. A working class neighborhood of immigrants that are lower middle class can end up doing just as well as a neighborhood of educated professionals, provided the families are intact and the immigrant families pay attention to the education. This is exactly how Asians end up going from poor immigrants to highly educated professionals in one or two generations. The difference is the rich neighborhood will give a much higher quality education to the student because professional, educated parents insist on it. Unfortunately, middle class and lower middle class families don\'t. They are far more focused on their child having a positive experience and they tolerate C students and don\'t really care that much about their kids competency in school. They are far more likely to encourage Prom than an economics elective. Likewise, their school boards focus more on the social aspect of school than on education.\nThe second predictor for how well a school performs is the school board. If a school board is 100% committed to excellence in education, the educational program will be spectacular. The problem is, almost no school boards are 100% devoted to education. Many of them have ""sports"" parents or ""arts"" parents or ""diversity"" liberals or some other axe to grind. Many parents just want to focus on social groups and social activities. You have no idea how easy it is for an administration to suck up to a parent on the school board by making their kid part of the varsity team or lead in the school play. Administrators are extremely good at sucking up to and manipulating parents and frankly, this is why most of those parents run for the school board.\nMoney to student ratio is not a predictor at all. In fact, the students who cost the most money or the districts that cost the most money are usually Big City schools in poor neighborhoods where half the class doesn\'t even graduate from High School and they\'re barely functional when they do.\nTeacher to student ratio also does not matter because usually schools with lots and lots of teachers, means there\'s a ton of special ed students and problem students. Student/teacher ratios are great in ""prison to pipeline"" schools because most of the class doesn\'t even show up but yet, they\'re failing.\n', '\nKeeping you busy at a shitty, low-paying job was how they did it.\nWomen used to stay home and raise the children.\n', '\nKek.\n', '\nDon‚Äôt blame sports, you lazy asshole.

She's been embraced by all the best people in MAGA they cheated her out of az governor, she is doing tons and tons of damage to the dems and she's not even in office.\nNo shade to desantis other than his stance on red flag gun laws and being groomed by rinos. But Lake as VP is genius if she can't be gov.\nImagine her debating cackles... imagine her doing vp things. While desantis keeps reigning in florida, reinforcing that state against globalist influence.\nThen in 28, lake and desantis can go on to be the best ticket in our lifetime. President Lake, and vp Desantis. And then. Assuming desantis isn't the dem plant (lol) he can be president in 36 to 44. He's only 44. So he'll be 57.

I said that was all 90% of us knew about him before he won. We knew he was rich, we knew he had successes and failures in business, and we knew he was a reality TV star with a lot of marital scandals and shit.\nMeanwhile you disingenuous fucks parade around lacking every dimension of comprehension skill that could exist on this planet. You see, we are all on the same side here, (presumably), and you fucks are so keen on circular firing squads that you can't even tell why we keep losing and being divided.\nFrankly, I'm with Trump, not you, not any of you. I'm with Trump, and Trumps populistic vision. Even as a libertarian, it's clear he is the only real option we have.\nAnd, it's also clear that people have a preference for Lake over Desantis for VP. And judging by his behind-the-scenes interactions with Lake, I bet Trump has a preference for Lake atm over Desantis. I think he and Desantis might be trying to pretend to be opponents to distance themselves from one another so they can have plausible deniability with independent voters so that when Desantis inevitably reaches the age and time when he should be president, he can without the media being able to slander him with Trump connections.\nSo, a good strategist would agree, she is a better pick for VP right now than Desantis ever could be. And you diptshits are niggling and bickering over the fact I said he was a reality TV star? You fucks aren't even thinking 2 dimensionally, let alone 3.\nHonestly, with morons like you shooting your divisive ignorant mouths off around here and attacking people on your own side (again presumably, because you guys sound like shills), with people like you, we deserve to be under DNC/rino/GOP control. You have no sense for strategy, no sense for optics. Nothing.\nSo go ahead and call me names, go ahead and dogpile. You are either a shill or a moron and your insults do nothing but remind me to stock up on more ammo, and food and get as far away from civilization as I can, because you idiots are just as responsible for the state of chaos as the globalists.\nGood day sirs.\nI SAID GOOD DAY!\n"", '\nYour comparison to Trump also proves that you‚Äôre either brand new to politics or super young.

The VP slot is perfect for Lake, it's almost entirely optics oriented. And she is a queen of optics, arguably better than GEOTUS himself. If she proves herself as VP, then yes, she deserves a shot at POTUS. Followed by Desantis. Consider the ages of all these people as well.\nLake is 53. DeSantis is 44.\nIf she succeeds in 24 with Trump, but by the time 28 rolls around she will be 58 going on 59. If she gets two terms she will be 67ish when she is done in 36.\nThen Desantis, after serving as FL gov and whatever else, maybe even VP under Lake? (I think senator Desantis makes more sense in the interim IMHO, but let's see how it plays out I could be wrong there).\nSo DeSantis in 36 will be 57... About the same age as lake in 28. If he serves two terms he will be done in 44 at age 65ish.\nAssuming Desantis isn't really a Rino plant (I kinda think he isn't, but they def want it to look that way) It's literally a dream scenario.\nIt's 21 years of making America great again.

It\'s not debt, it\'s trust. That is what money is: a store of trust. Trust that you can use that note (or digital representation of a note that never existed) to buy good and services or pay taxes. Trust that that note will retain value enough for you to be able to meet your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly needs. It really has nothing to do with debt, other than the fact that debt is ALSO a form of currency and can be used as such in certain circumstances, just with more steps and more rules than money. Debt is just another form of trust, but the reverse of money. Debt does not cancel out money. On the contrary, both produce trust. Money is the trust that the thing will get you the other thing. Debt is the trust that you\'ll get the thing back from someone.\nSo, when they US prints money like mad, we instinctively think that will make the money we already have worth less. We are told that is how inflation works, and to a layman, that\'s all they need to know. In reality, inflation is more accurately called expansion. If you want your economy to grow, you must have expansion. If your monetary expansion sets pace with economic expansion, yielding effectively zero ""inflation"", most people think this is ideal. It is not. Because they can never track perfectly, because market dynamics will always cause supply and demand to fluctuate, and that will always cause the economy to expand or contract at unpredictable rates. So expanding your money faster than expanding your economy gives you a buffer zone for the economy to expand healthily without popping the money supply (which would cause deflation). But you don\'t want too much expansion or you would start to get REAL inflation, the bad kind. That is why a dollar seems to keep losing value, but only at a certain, barely perceptible rate. It forces you to spend that money sooner rather than sitting on it, which increases money velocity. Higher money velocity means that money is changing hands faster, which correlated with greater economic activity. Greater economic activity causes an expansion in trust in the currency that economy uses, and this in turn creates a demand for a greater expansion of that currency.\nAdditionally, greater money velocity and economic activity is a better time to incur debt. This debt essentially creates money out of nothing but the trust to pay it back. Pay it back with what? With the fruits of that economic activity, that production of wealth. ""Give me money today so I can make widgets and double that money."" The important part of that sentence is ""make"". Debt puts money to use in the economy producing wealth. Wealth then creates demand for greater expansion of the money supply. And so now you know why debt and inflation are actually good (in moderation, of course). So when the government sends money to wherever, they are doing so as a sort of investment, which they expect a return on in one way or another.\n', '\nThen the wealthiest nations in the world are Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Suriname, and Turkey, because they are expanding like crazy! More money every day! And then we have the historical examples of hungary, weimar republic, yugoslavia, etc.\nAll experienced hyperinflation. Or super-duper ""expansion"", to put it in your terms. Super trust! Super economic activity! Infinite widget-making!

Black Murders Matter. The police are too afraid to solve black murders. In the 1960s, 90% of murders were solved. That fell to 60% in 2000.

The church in russia actually has displaced communism in many ways as a cultural force over there and actually has political clout. Its more like the west 30 years ago then whatever the west now is.

You aren\'t an X and a Y chromosome, you\'re an XY chromosome. Nobody gives a shit about your individual X chromosome, nobody gives a shit about your individual Y chromosome, it\'s the fact that you\'re an XY chromosome, from the X of the mother and the Y of the father, that matters.\nAll in all though, it really shows that the schisms of Christianity are the most pathetic shit-show of poor communication and callous, self-important piety that you\'ll read in history. Even understanding the reasons given by both sides, it\'s a sad display of ignorance that lead to the constant fracture in one church that scattered the Christian people to the wind, and filled the pockets of shit like Franklin Graham or Joel Osteen.\nThe word of God is truth.

Ball's back in your court.\n"", '\nIt\'s a paradox. Those in power have enough power to prevent anyone from gaining enough power to threaten their\'s. It doesn\'t matter what someone is prior to getting elected because, by merit of the fact that they were elected, they\'re something different now. Conservative, republican, etc, these are all meaningless labels if the person they\'re applied to doesn\'t live out the meaning.\nThis is why the proof of our system\'s corruption was the President\'s seat being stolen. The election never could have been stolen unless the bottom levels had been sufficiently corrupted, this is why there are so much evidence coming from average citizens about the stolen election, paper boards being put up, counters being kicked out, hobbs calling her own election, etc.\nGetting Joe Biden into the white house wasn\'t proof that ""we need to work harder locally"" it was proof that the ""local"" wasn\'t enough to prevent the supplanting of power. The 2020 stolen election was them winning the super bowl and us walking home in defeat.\nHowever, we are only defeated so long as we believe we are defeated. While they have us arguing over left vs right or this governor vs that, they are maintaining their win.\nThe government of the USA is dead, not dying, dead. From the county level all the way up through SCOTUS, POTUS and congress. This doesn\'t mean that honest and genuine people aren\'t still working for our best interests. But it does mean that ""they"" will create a glass ceiling where we\'re never able to challenge their power.\nThat is until we the people realize that even though they stole from us that which was ours, we have all the power we need to take it back. That statement isn\'t ignorant of the cost of doing so. I firmly believe, though I pray I\'m wrong, that the only way to take this nation back is for enough of the people to mark a very clear line in the sand, ask God for His blessing, and then brace for the inevitable onslaught rushing our line.\nRight now, there are so many ""enemies"" to our cause that it is impossible to know that we have properly called all of them out. As well, it is darn near impossible to decipher friend, foe and innocent fool. We will find out damn fast just who our enemies are when we put our foot down and challenge their power.\nBut sitting around and discussing petty differences of minced words like ""libtard"" and ""conservative"" is wasteful at best and playing right into the enemy\'s hand.\nThe only thing any of us can do today is to realize that we\'re ready to sacrifice all that we have and all that we are to see this enemy beaten. This nation was formulated by men who asked God to be on the throne - the King. This very moment our King is keenly aware of the usurpation and evil throughout His land, He is not sleeping.\nOne day sooner or later He will have decided that we are ready to stand directly before this evil and to say no more. We will win, likely at great cost, but until He gather\'s us, we wait and prepare.\nThat may sound like metaphor and I don\'t know the literal future, but my imagination does wander towards pictures of patriot\'s standing together and fighting over our cities and towns. War, the likes of which spares no city and carves a line straight through the center of our nation. Not geographically, but in a way that it is brother vs brother and father vs sons. The civil war was fought to keep this nation united, but this war will be fought to divide it.\nThere is no alliance with evil, it is cancer. I\'m not saying to give up hope, exactly the opposite. I believe that we will one day have our nation back and that we can restore liberty for future generations. I believe this fight is worth fighting for our children and many more generations. But I don\'t like wasting time bemoaning ideas that have been tried and failed. Trump had 100m+ votes, this nation bled red that day as we clearly showed the world how badly we wish to prevent what was coming. However, what is coming has to come for our benefit. The knife can be used to injure and kill, but it also may be used to remove a tumor. Our election being stolen was just another incision.\nWe will win, not through the halls of politics, but the way we and liberty always have. By swearing to defy tyrants with all that we have and all that we are, our sacred honor.\n', '\nExcellent reply. I know in my heart this is what must happen. I just have trouble putting into words.\nMay you be one that gives motivational speeches as we go into battle.\n', ""\nWell I appreciate the compliment! What I want most isn't the be the leader of our cause, though I must subjugate my ego as it enjoys the flattery of the thought. What I want is to see this enemy suffocating all of us defeated, finally.\nI see this fight everywhere, in the streets, on the tv and in the mirror. I have made it my full time job, ditching my once fruitful career, to fight this enemy. An enemy I cannot name nor properly describe. Yet, like an old world explorer, I have staked my life and honor upon discovering that which I can only imagine today.\nI know this enemy we are embattled against is as real as my own hands are bound by it. At times, it appears to me to be nothing more than an extension of me. But I am not our enemy and it is not us either, we are merely entangled.\nThis suffocating force appears to be capable of over coming us at worst and equally matched at best. All of our systems, governances and organizations are infected with the stench I cannot bare to smell any longer. Watching our systems be corrupted feels as hopeless as a failed retreat. One where the only two options are to face the enemy which is a certain immediate death or to run away and prolong life for maybe a moment longer.\nEveryone I know appears to me to have chosen the latter and I watch them being gunned down one by one unarmed with a bullet to the back. Despite their efforts, they are being over run and they do not deserve the rape being perpetrated on them.\nThis enemy would like us to believe that the greatest hope we have is to remain where we are. The lie tangles the mind into falling victim to the belief that we are inseparable from this force. This force that would like nothing more than to destroy what is as it was already successful at destroying what was. The hubris of this enemy boils my blood and the only desire greater than watching it's defeat is to defend those I love, the innocent.\nOur words have been co-opted and our reality inverted so. The very meaning of our words, the power they once had, seems only to be of benefit towards our inevitable destruction. To speak against this enemy is to contribute to it. But that is the lie it has whispered in our ear. This enemy's greatest pleasure is in hearing us speak its words. In that way, we speak our own condemnation by granting it power over us.\nBut our opponent is wrong, it can be over come and the lies come from a place of weakness, I know this. I cannot know for sure, but I believe, that to win against this enemy will result in my demise. But the thought of success comforts me as I know that it isn't measured by the continuation of the life of my body, but by the torch of liberty being carried just long enough to hand off to the next person who will carry it.\nIf the whole world's light were to turn black and the flame of liberty snuffed out finally across all lands, let my soul carry the final torch. I won't ask for my life to be prolonged a single moment if I knew my demise would reignite the world.\nThis fight we are in is very real and who am I to survive it? The first man to charge any line does so knowing that his death is as good as certain. But this thought does not phase me, in fact, it encourages me. Because if the tree of liberty must be watered with blood, then whether it be my own or tyrants matters not. (Though, as long as I have breath, I'll do my best to make it the tyrant's sacrifice) If liberty and freedom is to end, then it shall not happen while my King grants me life on this earth.\nI don't want to be the leader of our cause, I just wish to lift the innocent and everyone I love from their struggle against subjugation, that they would have a choice devoid of coercion or lies to decide freely how they wish to live their life. Without delay I want to see everyone live in a world where pursuing happiness and following God comes with no threat or cost that our own sinful nature necessitates. The enemy we fight is not simply our own sinful nature nor the consequence of a fallen world. No, our enemy is very real and can be defeated. The force we struggle against does not have to be. And I don't believe that we must survive the end times of Revelation to see this enemy driven before us. Perhaps the end is here, no matter, my actions remain the same until the final moment my King returns.\nGod said, and I believe, that He grants a man his wishes should they be upright and pleasing to His plan. And I cannot reconcile a world devoid of hope being apart of God's desire for us, but that is where our enemy wishes us to believe we are today. And so, I have made clear my desire to push back this enemy, no matter the cost. If God was waiting for someone to send, then I simply wish to go first. That, I believe, is the best way I can describe duty. Duty does not ask the cost, nor discourage the plan, but marches straight towards it whistling with joy all along the way.\n"", '\nGood luck to you friend and good luck to freedom. I believe at my age I still have my heath, strength and endurance for some reason not revealed to me by God. I hope still to leave some mark or legacy in this world, so I await the feeling, sign or signal. I hope I stay heathy long enough to make a difference. I know this is a battle between good and evil. There is no other explanation. I was at Jan6 and ready then, but the time was not right, so I wait.\n', ""\nI wish I had been to J6! Thank you for going and representing!\nYou're right, clearly the time wasn't right. And, looking back, I'm glad to see what waiting has reveled. The only right time will be of God's timing - that much I know for certain. I wish for you, our generation of patriots to leave behind not just an inheritance for the next generation or the generation after that, but for 1000 generations. I don't know if we'll be able to pull of 1000 generations of wealth, but darnit if a man can't set his sights on a goal that lofty!\nOne day it will be the right day and my focus isn't on finding that day itself, but of being ready and willing to do all that is needed on it.\nIt's hard to worry about the storm when you're too busy riding the waves on your surf board having a hell of a time.\n"", '\nMake a joyful noise unto the Lord while planting freedom seeds in lizard people and send them to the lake of fire.\nTyrannical nerds, weak pencil neck noodle arm faggots time is coming to an end and they know it. The hubris and posturing is really covering a deep fear of where they are headed once Death catches up to them. Workers of iniquity know they are evil that they are losers. Liberty, Prosperity and true Freedom! Restore our Republic\n', '\nThose are the same thing\n', '\nNo.\n', '\nI actually do. I think Republicans like to raise people up to their potential though hard work, and encouraging programs around necessary skills.\nNJ got rid of high school extracurricular classes like woodworking, HVAC & mechanics in favor of pay to play vocational schools. If we put our money into programs that have shown to rise up people to their full potential, then I think a Republican COULD make a significant difference.\nWe would also need to enforce laws & policies that keep people safe in our cities (no more easy to bail bonds, or releasing criminals back onto the street for flimsy ""covid"" excuses.)\nHaving a small amount of the right people in key positions is a tiny part of pushing for a better & stronger America.\nLook at the executive orders that Murphy put out during Covid (NJ governor.) He eviscerated this state and small business. Not to mention the property taxes that are suffocating the middle class. For example, our 4 bedroom home on .23 acres cost us slightly under 10k this year in taxes alone.\nObviously, we would have to elect the RIGHT republican.

His plan will merely make things moderately better for 4 years, and then it will be entirely reversed the next time a Democrat gets in office, just like we've seen with Biden.\nThese things are what actually need to happen to legitimately fix the country:\n\n\nEnd the federal reserve. Our fiat currency and fractional reserve banking systems are destroying us. Not to mention the bankers are pushing this ESG shit on the country through American business. Trump has NEVER once suggested he has any interest in this whatsoever.\n\n\nRepeal the 16th amendment to abolish the income tax and IRS permanently. The tax code is the primary weapon of the federal government when it comes to social and economic engineering. It's extortion, which is a form of theft. The founders explicitly outlawed direct taxation because they understood that it's a form of slavery. All Trump has ever suggested is measly tax cuts that just expire later on. That fixes NOTHING. It just moderately improves things temporarily.\n\n\nRepeal the Administrative Procedure Act and close every federal department created since it was passed. The Administrative state IS THE SWAMP. The executive branch's role is to enforce the laws congress writes, not write their own. 90% of the departments and agencies in our federal government have been created since FDR's APA. This is NOT the type of government we're supposed to have. It's a clear violation of the separation of powers. All Trump wants to do is de-regulate again, while leaving all the departments in place. He did that in his first term. He cut 20,000 pages from the federal register. It took Biden all of 1 year to add that many back again. It solves NOTHING. The departments need to be CLOSED.\n\n\nDramatically cut federal spending because debt and its corresponding interest payment is now an existential threat. 75% of that spending is on entitlement programs, so you cannot significantly cut spending without cutting those, yet Trump has repeatedly said he no interest in cutting entitlements AT ALL. That's exactly why 8 trillion was added to the debt in his one term.\n\n\nSo unfortunately the country is screwed. There's NOBODY even suggesting they will try to do what must be done. One party wants to exacerbate all of this, and the other isn't willing to even acknowledge the problems, let alone fix them. You can let the downvotes commence, but by all means please also EXPLAIN HOW I'M WRONG.\n"", '\nActually if he would just take power and work with allies to clean up voter fraud issues, I think the country would be red forever.\n', ""\nFORTUNATELY YOU ARE VERY, VERY WRONG. : -).

Regards of what we know that is what they will see. Their default view for them will be violence is bad, and Trumps 1st presidency ended in a riot. The upside is that the economy is shit, war is here, crime is through the roof and there is no sign of any if it doing anything but get worse. They need to be exposed to all this and the insanity of the left, I don't like the idea of anti-voting someone in since it means you don't care as much about who you are voting for but I reckon it's going to win more people over than anything else.\nBut it doesn't end there though, we've been winning somewhat against the RINOs, many who voted to impeach Trump are now gone and in their place MAGA candidates have replaced them. But McConnell is still senate minority leader, McCarthy is speaker, faces like Romney and Crenshaw are still spewing their ugly heads, and each of them will be doing everything they can to ensure one of their own wins the presidential nomination. The fight starts will them, the voters need to know now rather than later that RINOs are controlled opposition, in it only to serve themselves.\nThe first war is with the Republicans themselves, but that doesn't mean ignore the other one, campaigning for Trump and Americans First candidates should have already begun, ballot harvesting plans should be underway, council boards should be fought to get on to change the system from within.

Doesn't need to be his main thing, just create a strip series with all the usual suspects doing their thing. He has a knack for revealing the sordid side of people without being rude or crude. Do it!!\n"", '\nI remember Adams saying, years ago, that he was frustrated by something. He\'d made up an office-worker character who was an intern from India, and readers criticized him for ""negatively stereotyping Indians"". Adams noted that in a strip full of bumbling, cynical, lazy and stupid people, this guy\'s main fault was being naive, not wicked. And Adams still got flak for him.\nI wonder if Adams\' eyes have been opened at all to how maybe, some of the groups like ""anti-vaxx"" (sic) people that he\'s mocked might\'ve been falsely accused.\n', '\nI would LOVE to be the owner of the independent print shop that invites him to produce materials for sale online. Huge orders! The very best calendars! Comic books written by an experienced and mature mind! Not to mention funny as hell.\nHe released a book of his comics titled, ""Go Add Value Someplace Else"" which is still a funny title 10 years later üòÇ ""Show some respect for your superiors!"" He\'s been awake probably all his life, but had to jump out of the alligator\'s mouth at the last second just recently. I forgive him because it was concerning an area of expertise outside of his experience -- pharmacult.\n', '\nWas that character Asok? One of the few I remember.\n', '\nI think that was his name, yeah. Aha! https://dilbert.com/strip/1996-03-20\n', '\nDifferent from Asok the Defiler, I suppose\n', '\nSimpsons Apoo got same treatment\n', '\nLooked up the character... it\'s been a long time since I saw the show. I recall Apu was an illegal immigrant who got caught and threatened with deportation, but took a citizenship test and passed while the Scottish Groundskeeper Willie got deported instead. Apu then immediately pumped out 8 kids. A wiki page says only that he\'s a ""naturalized citizen"".\n\nIn April 2021, Hank Azaria apologized to every Indian for voicing Apu, despite the character (similarly to Speedy Gonzales for Mexicans) being beloved by majorities of Indians and Indian Americans\n\n', '\nI\'m anti Vax, and even I find some of the people I have marched with ""fucking crazy"", and it\'s true. Just because your right about one thing, doesn\'t mean you aren\'t fucking delusional about everything else. Like there were people claiming the government would put the Vax in the drinking water\n', ""\n\nLike there were people claiming the government would put the Vax in the drinking water\n\nIs there some reason for believing that's impossible?\n"", ""\nNo, but unless they are actually going to do it, being instantly reactionary like this comes across as delusional to anyone on the outside, and it gives us a bad image. That's all I am saying. Don't want the jab? Sure, that's your choice, but save all the delusional shit because it's not helping.\nMy uncle is even worse, he believes in that throat gargle bullshit, and he's known for being semi retarded like this at the kids child care (of all the places). Conveying the message in a rational fashion is how we eventually win this information war.\nSensible reporting of facts is how this is turning around finally as the media, science is backing up our claims finally. And there is no such thing as vaccine in the water or food supply.\n"", '\nNo one wants you on their side you sniveling, retarded faggot. You‚Äôre gullible and stupid.\n', '\n\nMy uncle is even worse, he believes in that throat gargle bullshit\n\nWhat is that\n', ""\nIt's some bullshit you put in your throat and gargle it, it's for people who were paranoid about catching COVID. Like my uncle who is an anti vaxxer but is too much of a pussy to attend any protests. He's pessimistic and doesn't believe we can fix any of this.\nOne day when we finally set the world right, maybe he will claim credit for literally spending the entire COVID period locked in his house too paranoid to leave it. He's a pussy, likes to tell me how he refuses to fuck his wife, she's Vietnamese so cannot leave him, so he just goes to the brothel to pay for sex instead. Tells the world he caught Hep from her, even though 84% of Vietnam has Hep because nobody washes hands correctly.\nWhen I go to Vietnam I at least have the intelligence to get the hep shots.\n"", '\nYeah. I\'m not against vaccines in general for instance; I think this particular set was handled so dishonestly that I don\'t trust them.\nSimilarly, I don\'t think there\'s literal truth to the idea that a magical demon is going to erupt from the earth and start chanting ""666!"", but that (the ""no man may buy or sell"" part) is a great meme for helping people resist central bank digital currencies and social credit scores.\nAlso, some of the crazier ideas have some grain of truth to them. I think Gates & Co. did propose something about including mRNA vaccines in food somehow, so it may not be something they\'re really doing but it\'s not total nonsense either. And the classic Alex Jones ""they\'re turnin\' the frogs gay"" meme is based on real observations that pollution is mimicking the effects of sex hormones in wildlife, with the worry that that might also be having an effect on humans.\n', '\nJeez, bill Gates only stated he wants to inject farm animals with the vax. You don‚Äôt think that vaxxed farm meat could spread the spike protein. Perhaps judge less and research more.\n', '\nHAHA... okay, so putting mRNA vaccines into mosquitos is perfectly normal and rational but putting it into drinking water is ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù? Okay faggot.\n', ""\nBoth are delusional. It doesn't make any sense. They already vaccinated nearly everyone just by manipulating the media, why would you need to put it into the water? It's delusional.\n"", '\nYour problem is that you are too dumb to realize that your opinion isn‚Äôt really worth a damn. Like seriously- you have a room temperature IQ at best and are not in a position to be deciding what is ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù or rational.\nTake your stupid reply for instance. You say there is no point in exposing people to it through the water source since everyone has already taken it.\nNo we haven‚Äôt, dipshit. I sure as fuck haven‚Äôt taken it. Why would a government actively trying to kill me stop at the water supply? They already fucking load it full of fluoride- a known neurotoxin. They‚Äôve also been dumping toxic chemicals into the ground water for decades. What‚Äôs to stop them from dumping more shit in?\nSo for someone with a functioning brain, it‚Äôs really not that hard to see that exposing people to mRNA via food and water supply is not far fetched at all. It doesn‚Äôt mean I believe that. It just certainly isn‚Äôt grounds for the gaslighting dismissal from people like you. In fact, the only reason they probably didn‚Äôt do it is because mRNA is very unstable and can‚Äôt be administered orally. But that‚Äôs not your level of thinking, understand? That‚Äôs from someone with a functioning brain.\nSo you be a good little lemming and keep soaking your diapers for the elite. But do so in the privacy of your OWN diseased little mind and leave society out of it. We don‚Äôt want to hear your low IQ stupid pseudo arguments.\n', ""\nNever attribute to malice, what can best be described as incompetence. The vaccines weren't designed to kill people, nor would it be possible to add them into the food / water supply. Can you even imagine the infrastructure required to pull that off? You simply cannot get away with a conspiracy on that level whilst introducing so many elements into the play.\nDo you drink the water knowing that it contains fluoride? I mean we know for a fact the PFA's are in the water and food supply, that every human being on the face of this planet has them in their body. Yet, you went the fluoride route?\nI prefer to believe the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Meaning, that if the government did do this, it's on the back of good intentions. Thus, we go back to the government taking the least path to vaccinations, and that apparently was able to reach 97% of people. So suddenly the government is going to take a massive conspiracy dump into the water supply to somehow reach the remaining 3%?\n"", '\nYou know how only people that understood his message agreed with him? Same thing for ""anti Vax mockery""\n', '\nHis comics have been politically charged for a good while now. It‚Äôs hit or miss but usually worth reading through the weekly story arcs.\n', ""\nI have a feeling this is coming... These leftists that aren't able to be eaten by the mob will be the mob's worst enemy. Fuck the legion of demons straight back to the lake of fire where they all belong. Humility will always be the light to their dark pride.\n"", ""\nIt'll happen.\n"", '\nDilbert uncensored. Lol. Would be epic\n', '\n\nDude just print Dilbert comic books on demand and you\'ll make more money than ever.\n\nYes Indeed. Ethan Van Sciver, a long-time DC comic book artist (fairly famous, in the comic book world), has made almost 2 million dollars self publishing his comic books.\nA black guy named Eric July (YoungRippa) has made almost 4 million dollars self publishing his comic books. Both in around a year or two.\nIt can be done. These guys are conservative. Make your own ""they"" said. These guys said; ""Okay"" and WON.\n', '\nEric July is fucking awesome. He has a slash metal band called Backwordz with catchy songs with liberty minded lyrics.\n', ""\nHey, how about that, I didn't know. Guy is multi-talented, and he has a cool name. lol I hope he, and we, all have the best year we can.\n"", ""\nYoungRippa is not actually conservative if I recall, he's anarchist.\nBut the thing is, except for incidentally, he promised not to put any politics whatsoever into his Rippaverse comics.\nProbably why he had better luck that Ethan Van Sciver, who makes a big deal out of shitting on legacy comic companies, or at least did for a long time.\nAnd the fact that Van Sciver uses crowdfunding, which has a somewhat deservedly bad reputation. Absurdly long lead times for deliveries.\nEric July on the other hand uses direct-to-consumer sales. No crowdfunding.\n"", '\nIt\'s right-wing anarchism, aka voluntaryism aka anarchocapitalism\nWhich is absolutely nothing like the ""regular"" anarchists and their commie ""everything should be free and white people suck"" bullshit.\nVoluntaryism is what you get when American libertarianism is taken to its logical conclusion and it\'s not so much a lifestyle but a set of principles that embody values like non aggression, self defense, free markets/voluntary exchange, peaceful parenting, home schooling, private property, jury nullification, and looking for solutions to mostly societal problems without getting the government involved.\nLook up his band Backwordz and you see the gold and black symbols of voluntaryists and even through his lyrics he disparages everything collectivist and left wing.\n', '\nOh I totally agree. I never meant to portray him as an AnCom.\n', '\nMan, needed urban dictionary for some of these. Peacocks = homos, dopamine gooners = porn addicts.\n', '\nDopamine gooners also = any tablet/phone addict.\n', '\nI learned about Goon culture the other day and a goon is not just any old porn addict but someone who edges (masturbates without arriving to climax) over a period of several HOURS to several DAYS in order to work themselves into a trance which they believe is the ultimate heightened state akin to a religious experience.\nBut I think one would get the same or similar effect by focusing on doing anything at all for several hours to several days.\n', ""\nPeacocks aren't homos.

And this is no exception. We obviously shouldn't be giving people free money from our tax dollars (and inflation from printing more money). But I still believe it is important to consider what those economic consequences will be so that we can prepare for them:\nThe payments (and interest) were suspended at the start of the plandemic. Instantly, people had an extra $100-$1000/month in their accounts depending on their previous monthly payment. Because the interest was also suspended, even most financially savvy borrowers stopped paying during this time; financially stupid borrowers obviously stopped paying as well. Most of these people told themselves they would set the money to the side and build up a bit of a nest egg, but it's rare for people to be diligent enough to actually track their finances and ensure they're doing this.\nSo what else happened during this time? Massive inflation. These borrowers were able to keep the same lifestyle, despite everything going up in price, because they had this extra $100-$1000/month they could gradually grow to dip into as the prices went up. Most without even realizing it.\nSo while those of us who did not borrow were forced to gradually make lifestyle changes to accommodate for the rising cost of living over the past two years, these borrowers will have to make those same changes instantly when these payments return.\nA better way to bring us out of this bad situation is a phased in approach. Quarter payments for 4 months, half payments for 4 months, 3/4 payments for 4 months, then full payments.\n"", '\nDoing the right thing is paying back your debt instead of gallivanting around partying with your neighbors money.\n', ""\nDoing the right thing is having a bankruptcy system that applies to ALL debt.

Because I know plenty of engineers who have a lot of student debt. The difference is that they tend to know it was an investment in their future that they have to pay back. But they still hold the debt and the effects I describe will still affect them.\n\nLet them feel the full force of Biden\'s economy\n\nI don\'t disagree, but we should still be aware of the impact to everyone that this will have, just so we can prepare ourselves for it.

Medical and Advanced Law degrees had a higher median debt, but the number of graduates are dwarfed by the larger majors, which I would venture to guess.\nAnyways, my main point is: we don‚Äôt need to delay interest-free repayments, it‚Äôs not on the financial institutions to hold the burden of debt without interest for any longer, regardless of what amount of debt anyone may have.\n', '\nI agree.\nHowever, I will also add that this entire problem is one created by the government. Two major factors: 1) The government is heavily involved in the student loan business, ensuring that anyone can get a (predatory) loan with virtually no limit and 2) Public education nails into the brain of all naive children that college is the only path to success.\nWhen you combine these two, you have a recipe for loads of children to take out massive loans they likely will not be able to afford in the future, without much regard to how much money they\'re actually borrowing. The universities themselves do a fantastic job at separating students from the amount of money they\'re actually spending (on all levels; when I went to college, I literally didn\'t even know what the tuition I was paying was, something that\'s insane since I had to sign for it somewhere; but then they also typically have day-to-day expenses that they obfuscate through things like ""meal plans"" and pre-paid cards that only work within the university).\nIs student loan forgiveness the answer? No. But we should still fix the root cause and get government out of education.\n', '\nWhy can‚Äôt student debt be dischargeable in bankruptcy?\n', ""\nIn the 1980s it was dischargeable. The issue was that people would go to an expensive school then immediately file bankruptcy after graduation. This became really popular to do for med students because of the very low wage working as residents and doing fellowships. It was an easy exploit of the system. Thus, many boomer doctors became rich quickly because they shook off their student loans and could start their practice immediately. They also had insurance not being captured by medicare/medicaid and people still paid out of pocket for much of their healthcare. They could make so much money so quickly after bankruptcy that they could easily weather the 7 years of financial shame by just paying cash for everything. This is a major reason why student loans being dischargeable was removed in Dubya's tax reform act.\n"", ""\nIt should never have been.

Said very publicly something like the evidence was overwhelming and compelling and that the gender surgeries were utterly failed and they had to cease immediately. And just like that, basically every doctor in the U.S. stopped doing them. Europe took a few years to catch up, which provided some fodder for U.S. and/or Canadian-based sketch comedy shows, but eventually Europe stopped too.\nThen like out of nowhere during the Obama years all this shit comes back as part of the (not-at-all) Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) and no one on either side of the debate mentions at all the experiments in the 1970s that so overwhelmingly indicated that gender surgeries were hurting the patients.

It was clear that they needed the seat because, with him present, they'd never deprecate the dysphoria as mental illness.\nFinally, though, primarily due to age and the constant pressure, he stepped down. Almost immediately after, they got their shill in the position and ushered in the wave of surgery and pedophilia we see now.\nThere were some, mostly among gamergaters, who had their eye on that ball when it was going down, but it was so early that those of us aware had trouble getting others to understand what was happening.\nEDIT: It might have been Paul McHugh.\nEDIT: McHugh is the guy you're talking about.

Not getting into the stuff with kids because that\'s a whole \'nother text wall, but I\'m pretty sure we all know where we stand on that topic. Anyway, moving on...\nConcerning the true motivations behind these trannies and wanting to transition, I\'m always reminded of this documentary I saw on HBO in the \'90s. It centered around a group of trans friends that were getting together to go to a trans convention (imagine the smell). The group was a mixture of biological males and females.\nThe one that fascinated me was a female-to-male transition that was totally pulling it off. She wasn\'t a caricature of a dude, she just seemed like some guy. A friend of your dad\'s or something. She carried herself, walked and had facial hair, just like a dude. The only real giveaway was her voice, but some dudes have higher pitched voices (see TheSaltyCracker for a quick example).\nFlash forward to them attending the convention and the film crew finds the female trans in the lobby, sobbing into her hands. It turns out that other attendees thought she was just some normie and told her she was in the wrong place, triggering the breakdown.\nI was baffled. I\'d thought the whole point of it was to make the transformation unnoticeable so you could be accepted as the sex you\'ve convinced yourself you ""feel"" like. But then it dawned on me that this isn\'t what she wanted, she wanted the attention of being trans.\nAfter that realization, I find it difficult to care about their hysteria because I\'m convinced they\'re all just attention whores. Especially with how many of them aren\'t even trying.\nAnd right now, trannies are getting waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much attention.\nThey say ""don\'t feed the trolls"" but this also applies to narcissists.\n', '\nThis is often a big part of it.\nOne of my friends is ‚Äútransitioning‚Äù now. They can basically get 100+ social media reactions on demand just by posting some kind of self doubt post. Used to be he might get a handful of reactions to a post. And the girls that friend zoned him are fueling it. They‚Äôd never go on a date with him or give him much though but now they want to get together and do his hair and stuff. He‚Äôs getting the attention he never could.\n', ""\nIt's a narcissism feedback loop of attention seeking by low value males and their female counterparts.\nHe gets more attention, and by giving him more attention they get more attention, repeat.\n"", '\n‚ÄúYou look so beauuuuutiful!!‚Äù\n', '\nPretty much. Meanwhile I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúDude! Remember when we ran that marathon together? You saved my life by helping me recover from cancer. Good times!‚Äù I‚Äôm hoping the memories eventually kick in over mega friend zoned by fat ugly chicks.\n', ""\nIt's worse than just attention. Three quarters of MtF's are autogynephilic, that is to say they're getting off on being perceived as a woman.\n"", '\nAlways has been.\n', '\nYeah, duh‚Ä¶ if the idea is that you will commit suicide because you hate your sex characteristics then of course it is a mental disorder. And when the intervention to try to remove your sex characteristics doesn‚Äôt work and you still end up committing suicide, of course it is a mental disorder.\nNow that that is established, how do we actually treat this?\nMy thoughts is maybe we try to encourage them towards finding components of their sex characteristics they can be happy with and from there have them accept those components. And then start having a positive outlook of oneself and their birth understanding that the self is social, physical, spiritual, and mental. And the physical is a necessary part to unify the social and the mental.\nLeave your ideas below on what experiments scientists should engage in to actually treat this mental disorder?\n', '\nFor me, it has always been about learning to love yourself as God made you. Simple concept. Not sure why these therapists are ignoring it. Isn‚Äôt this what they do for anorexics?\n', '\nOne thing is real: one can change their body and they can do so in a positive way when they do so alongside god. Eat healthy, exercise, pursue work, don‚Äôt go overboard on each and every minor fault dedicating millions towards plastic surgery that eventually makes your look like a demon (Madonna). And soon enough you can take a body that is slovenly, ugly, and weak and make it something more idealized. And along the process, you will find yourself liking your body more and more.\nPhysical bodies made through sins of pride, envy, sloth, wrath, lust, vanity, gluttony, and greed will always leave you in a bad state. And the trans phenomenon is a phenomenon of envy for the opposite sex or a form of self-lust (narcissism), except as a female. But sin always comes back to bite.\n', '\nThe main thing most of """"The-Rape-Ists"""", don\'t understand is that mental disorders are an Entirely Mental thing, it has Nothing to do with the Physical World, and to address the Mind, one MUST, no choice to it, MUST, deal directly with the Spirit, the Self, Elan Vital, Soul, what we normal people refer to when we say """"I, ME, AM""""....\nMany of us comprehend that WE are Spirits having a Human Experience, not the other way around, but soo man others have been lost in the whole Human experience that they no longer know their Originally come from the Non-Physical World....\nTHAT, in and of itself explains the reasoning or mindset of the wannabe Overlords, they no longer believe they came from the Spirit world just like the rest of us, and solidly believe they are purely Physical Manifestations, therefore, to die is simply to Cease to exist, or to transcend Death is to become gods, which is their silly religion of """"Human-ism"""" or the """"I become god"""", and many actually believe that they are """"A"""" god, and try to prove it by causing effects in Society, which usually take lots of Money to do so, but they\'ll spend it and say """"Look at the effect my intention had"""", when it was only the Money that created that effect....\nAnd THAT is the level of Insanity we are dealing with, which to any sane person, is easily seen as Pure Evil, and in certain ways it is Evil, because they spread their Sickness to others, and it only makes the Planet into a much more dangerous world that it originally was meant to be....\n', '\nI think modern psychiatry knows full well how to treat people with gender dysphoria.

Pastor Pete Peters is a classic example. That being said American Catholics have done a much better job thus far from being liberalized. That could be because Protestant churches were targeted earlier on or heavier, it could be due to the differing nature of the churches. Originally Catholics in America were much more in favor of Democrat politicians. Steve Bannon has said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs Irish catholic. He was born and raised a Democrat.‚Äù I recognize that it‚Äôs in no way the same democrat party, but as much as 80% of Catholics in America supported FDR and by today‚Äôs standards, at least pre Biden standards, FDR is commonly considered in republican circles to be one of the worst presidents we have had.\nRoosevelt‚Äôs New Deals suddenly inserted the federal government into every local community. NRA set all prices and wages. AAA controlled agricultural production. The Wagner Act established huge industrial unions that became major institutions in the industrial belt from Pennsylvania to Illinois. WPA employed workers in almost every city and county. Then there‚Äôs ww2. Today many liberals celebrate FDR as a hero of liberalism, but it was really Catholics who he had the most support from.\nI say this more as an example of how the church can be used for political purposes. There are far smarter people than me on this subject, so open to learning more. I think the Protestants were much more nativists and anti immigration, which the Catholics at that time didn‚Äôt like as they were the original ‚Äúurban immigrant vote‚Äù then somewhere in the 60s Catholics started having their big cities filled with nonwhites, and they came around to nativism and anti immigration paving the way for more of a religious right in the 80s.\n', '\nYou are mainly over the mark.

But Rupert's company isn't about politics for him, he wants to make money primarily. He's an old school capitalist, not a propagandist. Rupert has actually kept his kids from turning Fox into another CNN or MSNBC. He wants Fox to be conservative because that makes money.\nAre all Fox's hosts anti-Trump? No. Gutfeld, Perino, Hannity, Kudlow, Bartiromo, Ingraham, Pirro, & Waters are all pro-Trump. I don't know about the rest. I watched Tucker being interviewed on Tulsi Gabbard's podcast yesterday. I didn't know she had a podcast either until YT shoved it in front of me, & even though I don't like Tulsi, I watched it to see how Tucker came off when outside Fox's fence. Tulsi specifically asked him about Trump. He doesn't like Trump's bombasticness but he sees how Trumps policies & accomplishments are good for America & actually make a lot of sense. Tucker fraternizes with Trump. He's known Trump personally a long time. His friends jumped all over him for having that relationship with him. But he stuck with Trump. Many say Tucker is only out for Tucker so I can't say I know he's a Trump supporter for sure, but he is for truth, for the traditional family, for faith, for integrity in government & citizens alike, & is anti-leftism.\nWith the release of documents from the Dominion lawsuit against Fox, there were incriminating texts & emails from both sides. Rupert is scared out of his mind that if Dominion wins, Fox is gone. $14 billion is a lot of money. And that's why Murdock has ordered his staff to not say anything about election fraud nor voting machines/software. Guests being interviewed are given the same order. Rupert's a businessman & only cares about his money. Tucker, you may know, periodically has broached the subject of election fraud. He does it in the sneakiest & most obtuse way that it makes me laugh. It's like he's prodding the bear, testing to see how far he can go. I know a lot of you all hate Tucker, but he's the only one on Fox with the balls to do that.\nMike Lindell several years ago explained the mechanics of what Dominion is doing. They sent notices of intent to sue to everyone they could find that mentioned election fraud publicly, him included.

Everyone will relax, hopefully Rupert will relax & remove the muzzles from his show hosts. Gotta wait & see.\nWhat I see going on on this forum is self-destruction. Can't you see that? Trump won in 2016 because of Fox. Fox may now not be pushing Trump, but they stand for conservatism, traditional family values, faith, & prosperity through hard work. You guys want to destroy that?

It's much harder for the NWO to enforce their tyranny when your local government and business owners refuses to obey.\nBut you'll also need major changes to undo the decades or even centuries of indoctrination that allowed degeneracy to slowly creep into your community. The first step is to get rid of all the media and materials that show degeneracy.\n\n\nHomeowners should collect 99% of any movie made by Hollywood and Disney and immediately burn them or paint the covers black and damage them beyond repair before throwing them in the trash. This also applies to any other movie, show, documentary, etc that shows degeneracy.\n\n\nLibraries should be purged of the same materials no matter what format they are in. Your children are being exposed to degeneracy in these places and by learning immoral behavior at young age, it is normalized to them. It is best to claim the library is being remodeled if you suspect women will be a major problem and try to take the erotic books prior to burning them. Claims of a remodel will allow you to empty shelves without suspicion while immoral books are being returned rather than kept in houses.\n\n\nBusiness owners and well known land owners should run for office and ensure that the schools are free of degeneracy. Do not bother trying to ban Netflix, Disney, or other degenerate media companies. This is because America offers them the freedom to publish and banning them will be a waste of time and taxpayer money. Instead ban the streaming, creation, possession, and showing of any content in any format that displays underage sexual and intimate acts, genital mutilation, teaching minors sexual behaviors and identity, beastiality in any form, nudity, sexual relations before marriage, and profanity. This will force streaming services to block your county or only show movies and shows that aren't complete degeneracy.\n\n\nUnfortunately not everyone will go along with these steps. Someone will keep erotic books and turn their house into a den of filth and others will use a VPN. No system is perfect. This solution is only designed to minimize exposure to indoctrination and stop the normalization of degeneracy. Then perhaps people will develop a stronger moral compass and stand against globalism.\n"", ""\nYou act like Blockbuster is still open. I haven't seen a DVD in years.

The thing that makes the game drag on forever is ""house rules"" like money on Free Parking or not putting properties up for auction when someone lands on them.\n', '\nTry auction mode where if you pass it goes up for auction. Makes it go really fast and its fun.\n', '\nWe live in a society now where woke retards rail against capitalism on social media while posting photos of their collection of dozens of Squishmallows using their mobile devices.\n', ""\nThe same millennials who never miss a new release of an Apple device And by all the latest designer fashion are also the same ones who rail against capitalism\nI'm sure if we conducted a study we would find that the biggest critics of capitalism are also the ones who buy the most products produced by actual slaves in third world countries..\nAin't Joe the plumber from Missouri buying the latest sneakers and iPhones every year and getting it is sleeping bag to wait online for the newest iPad even though it's no different than the one he had from thee last year\n"", '\nWhere are their parents? To teach them values and right from wrong?\n', '\nHoly shit thats the most brilliant summation of it all\n', '\nThis was my first thought. It was designed to illustrate the evils of caoitalism by a nutso socialist.\n', '\nYep. The whole thing is a parody of capitalism.\n', '\n"" The history of Monopoly can be traced back to 1903 when American anti-monopolist Lizzie Magie created a game ... It was intended as an educational tool, to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land-in private monopolies""\n', '\nSo says the socialists. Monopoly is an amalgam of many independently created games that were synthesized by Charles Darrow out of Atlantic city into the modern form we now have.\nMonopolies are bad, but they are natural. A monopoly becomes so by being the most efficient and then teaming with government through bribes to destroy competition.\nThe consumer initially benefits but then is badly hurt through loss of innovation, too few economic opportunities, and the politicization of the asset when the bribed politicians turn around and convert the oligarchs assets to extremist ideology.\nBig tech is very illustrative of this. The consumer had largely maxed its gains by about 2010, and the last 13 years have been immensely destructive kicked off by the Obama teams totalitarian communist impulses.\n', '\nNo it wasn‚Äôt. The game it‚Äôs based on was designed that way, not Monopoly itself. It‚Äôs an obvious endorsement of capitalism, hence the gnashing of teeth by the communists at PBS.\n', '\nThe goal is to drive all your friends out of business by owning everything. Hence the name monopoly.\n', '\nAnd monopoly is the result of unchecked capitalism, so still a capitalist game. Monopolies aren‚Äôt inherently bad. If the company is comprised of good people, nothing bad will come of it. People are inherently bad, that‚Äôs where the problem is.\n', ""\nTrue monopolies can't exist without governments.\nThis ever-so-basic law of ACTUAL economics is how we can easily know the government is behind facebook, twitter, google, and amazon.\n"", ""\nThey could exist without governments... sort of. They'd just be the one being the government. What is communism but simply one mega company that owns and runs everything with its citizens being its employees and customers at the same time?\n"", '\nCommunism forces the workers to work.\nSocialism punishes the workers who work.\nCapitalism rewards the workers who work.\n', ""\nCapitalisim rewards workers who work up to the point that the employer is willing to reward them. Employers reward workers who work because they want to keep workers who work, and do not want them to go to other companies. But if there is no other companies for a worker to go to, you don't have capitalism anymore.\n"", ""\nIntellectual property, the things the makes all tech companies valuable, doesn't exist without government. IP is a government enforced monopoly, where only one entity is allowed to think a given thought. The argument is that IP benefits society on the whole, but make no mistake it is still a government created monopoly.\n"", '\nNo, if a monopoly exists, the profit incentive of providing a competing product becomes astronomical. The only way to prevent competition is through government.\n', ""\nIn an ideal capitalist world where people play the game fairly, and the monopolys stuck with only one market and didn't have aged money.\nTake Mcdonalds for example and say they've got a monopoly on the burger market, you'd think that a competitor rising up to challenge them would be a good move. But can a competitor rise up if Mcdonalds not only controls the burger market, but also the beef, bread, and vegetable markets? But it doesn't stop there. They control major media outlets, transportation, and realty as well. Housing, medical, banking.. you guess it. All controlled by Mcdonalds. They even have the clown patrol, their defacto enforcers and button men who punish anyone who'd dare to create a competing product.\n"", '\nThis is nonsense. Start a new banking system, start your veggie garden etc. You\'ll be a billionaire.\nAll I hear is ""I\'m a commie""\n', '\nWell you should stop being a commie.\n', ""\nI'm arguing for a completely free market economy. You're over there justifying tyranny.\ngtfo\n"", '\nThis is as wrong as your other statement. In a situation where providing a competing product is impossibly expensive, the only way to peaceful PROVIDE competition is through government.\n', '\nThere are some that are ""natural monopolies"" like power distribution, as long as it\'s wired, because the only alternative would be to have different companies laying powerlines, that would be wasteful and likely to cause problems. Though, I suppose without government/regulation, we wouldn\'t likely see the interconnected power grid and instead rely on smaller and more localized electrical grids...\n', ""\nYou're saying that, instead of just building new wires, it'd be better to be price-gauged by a single company?\nHere's another issue: if you have one asshole company price-gouging its customers, no factories are going to move there.\n"", ""\nNot saying better... just that when it comes to that kind of infrastructure there are more problems by having competition.\nMaterial - you'd have to have multiple sets of power lines for each company competing in that market.\nTechnical - a variety of problems come up, one example being that either they are separate and incompatible or they are synchronized and equivalent. The choice to change whose lines you use would then be an undertaking of its own.\nThis isn't referring to power generation, where there IS competition, just getting that power to where it can be used.\n"", '\nActually, there are places in America with multiple companies providing electricity on the same power lines. One company owns the power lines, and the other companies pay fees to transfer power on them. But they compete on pricing for the cost of the electricity provided.\n', ""\nIf it's what I'm thinking, most of those are contracts where the companies are effectively futures contracts.\nOne of those that's simple to explain in a sketch, not so easy in text.\n"", '\nI wish PBS would he shut down. Tired of hearing their opinions on anything.\n', '\nI came here to say this.\n', '\nIf only they knew the origins of the game which is freely available on the internet.\nDoes anyone at these agencies still work anymore?\n', '\nYour assumption is they argue in good faith\n', ""\nNah, I know they're fake and gay and just inventing a new outrage to get outraged over. It's good for some clicks.\nThe author probably sucks at Monopoly.\n"", '\nAlso PBS: Laughing and having fun is offensive\n', '\ncia has complete control over all mainstream media narratives\n', '\nThey probably suck at Monopoly.\n', '\nCommunist monopoly: no get out of jail card, can‚Äôt own property, and you can‚Äôt eat at all during the entire game. Sounds real fun.\n', '\nAll money is shared between players. Once money runs out you chase garbage trucks to eat.\n', '\nOnly after eating all the zoo animals.\n', '\n""Dogs - the nutritious gift your pet wants to give you"" - CNN\n', ""\nGet out of gulag cards, everyone gets assigned to one commie block apartment, nothing happens of an opponent steps on your apartment because you don't own it. No money, no bank, just food stamps.\n"", ""\nThere was a bank in Soviet Union which disappeared all savings accounts in 1991. But nevertheless it continued it's operations under the same brand.\n"", '\nWhat a great idea....\nCommunist Monopoly... no dice, no property, everyone is arrested by the NKVD and beaten for not spying on your neighbor, then everyone goes to jail, in the end you starve to death.\n', '\nFalse accusations, no property, and no dice? That‚Äôs just Clue.\n', '\nThere are dice in clue.\n', '\nThey made a socialist version. Real incidents occur and force you to cheat the collective.\n', '\nYeah and the leftists REEEEEEd until the game was pulled off the shelves. You can still find copies of it, though.\n', '\nI have a copy of it and it‚Äôs hilarious\n', '\nYou have to roll Yahtzee to get out of jail. Yes there are only two dice.\n', '\ni mean, thats why the game was made.\nno really, the game was created as a socialist propoganda tool to demonstrate the ""evils"" of landlord capitalism. thats why the rules of the game even states ""the bank can never go bankrupt, print your own money that only the bank can issue""\nits the point of the game\nhttps://aeon.co/ideas/monopoly-was-invented-to-demonstrate-the-evils-of-capitalism\nhttps://simulations.wharton.upenn.edu/2016/03/10/monopoly/\n', '\nReminds me of playing when I was a kid. Whoever was in charge of the bank always stole money, so we made a rule that if you were found to be embezzling from the bank you were automatically out of the game and your assets liquidated. lol\nAlso whoever got boardwalk and park place usually dominated, so we would form corporations where players would combine assets to combat the dominant player. I fucking love monopoly.\n', '\nThe key is to get the oranges. Trade everything if you have to, but get the oranges. In the mid to late game, everyone coming out of jail will likely land on the oranges. If you‚Äôve got houses and hotels, your cash will soar quickly.\nThen you go for the reds. Then the yellows. Then you take the light blues at the bottom to catch people coming around go.\nThe greens and dark blues are nice, but not necessary at all until the very end, if at all.\n', '\nI go for purples. Easy to put tons of houses on them early game.\n', '\nIf you follow the rules and want to win, the property sets immediately before and after Free Parking are by far the most valuable. This is due to the averages of the dice rolls, coupled with the Go To Jail space and cards, along with the various advancement cards (Advance to Go, Reading Railroad, Boardwalk, etc). You can do modelling of the board using statistical analysis to show this. People have also documented thousands of playthroughs to model it that way.\n', '\nBecause of this, these color blocks are the hardest to consolidate and build on. So you should focus on trading to gain them. Then the railroads.\n', ""\nIt's been a while since I did a deep dive and looked through the actual numbers, but from what i recall, the order of desireability is set 4, 5, 3, 7, 6, rr, 8, 2, ut, 1. This is with max hotels/houses prioritized to the most desireable properties. But again, it's been a while, so my numbers may be a bit off, and there is some luck involved. Where a game really sucks, while following the rules, is when you have the most possible players. If everyone refuses to trade properties, it's quite easy for noone to end up with a full set. And then the game can drag on forever.\n"", '\nGreens and dark blues with hotels become magnets. It literally changes the odds of dice rolls in our reality. You will hit them 1 out of every two rounds\n', '\nWhen my sister and first started playing Monopoly, Boardwalk and Park Place were the goals too. Then we realized how much more money could be made by buying up Marvin Gardens and the rest of the yellows, greens, oranges, railroads and utilities.\nWhoever controlled those dominated. We totally abandoned Boardwalk and Park Place.\n', ""\nIt really starts to click once you realize the earliest versions of this game were created while Bolsheviks were doing their things in Russia, so no surprise it would happen here too.\nThe Jews were starting to infiltrate across the globe. And it all coincides to the early 20th century. The federal reserve, women's suffrage, federal income tax, etc. Titanic sinking is another rabbit hole, supposedly a couple big name guys who were gonna speak against the federal reserve were on the Titanic. Maybe just pure coincidence, but I've always had a tough time with the titanic. Yes, a mountain of ice is huge, thick, and hard, like big Mike. But the front of boats are pointed, it would have been a glancing blow. I don't know how thick the steel was, but I can't see any ice breaking even a half inch steel plate today.\n"", '\nthe most common explanation of the Titanic was that the wrought iron rivets holding the steel together failed. the steel plates were fine, but they are not much good when they are not held together.\nThough the whole connection to the Federal Reserve, and how much the sinking of the Titanic has been fixed in the cultural history by media do make me wonder. Why draw so much attention to a ship sinking unless you want to control the narrative\n', '\nHas anyone ever recreated a scale version and tested their rivet style?\n', ""\nThat's not really how we do failure analysis on materials\n"", '\nInteresting‚Ä¶\n', ""\nIcebergs can destroy a ship's hull. It's about like running aground. I've worked with ships for almost 25 years, and I've seen the damage two very heavy objects can do running into each other. There's a reason we make ice-breaker ship hulls so extra thick and strong compared to normal ships.\n"", ""\nI understand that. I was just curious. Seeing how we were lied to about Vietnam, jfk, WMDs, Rittenhouse, jussie, bubba, j6, COVID, bidens laptop, Steele dossier, gulf of Tonkin, etc, I will question every official narrative until I die.\nAnd if people get arrested for questioning a narrative, eeeeh, that kind of tells me what I need to know.\nBut it's a strong coincidence about the federal reserve. It totally seems like something out establishment would do today, doesn't it?\n"", '\nThey would and have done terrible things. But survivors said it was a colision with an iceberg.\n', ""\nThat doesn't prove anything. I could find 1,000 people in my town who took the jabs and still say they are safe and effective.\nPeople are dumb, and can be bought.\n"", '\nAnd what does it then say when the free market says, naw we like the fun version?\n', '\nWOW.... I really cannot believe I just read what I actually read at the title for this post..\nPBS? really?\n...sad sad day\n', '\n\nPBS\n\nWe pay for this garbage.\n', '\nThe Annenberg Foundation can‚Äôt be expected to carry the entire bill, Comrade.\n', '\nDiversity hires\n', ""\nSadly not satire. If anyone hasn't seen the satirical comedy mini series Comrade Detective check it out. It's an ironic buddy cop show set in 1980's communist Romania, where the detectives chase cartels smuggling things like Monopoly games, Jordache jeans, and Pepsi to corrupt the good communist citizens.

A huge reason movie theaters are going under is precisely because of how affordable it\'s become to set up a theater in your own home with competitive audio and video.\nAnd even putting quality aside, people will always want a TV (or at least a ""screen"" with an HDMI input, which I think is what most will consider a TV nowadays since you can hook up nearly any input) in their living room, and likely bedroom, to be able to stream off [insert preferred streaming box], even if they are using a laptop or tablet as the input to that screen.

This is funny though.\n', ""\nYes, but that's a bigger project. There are limits to what even Elon can do by himself. He's rich, not omnipotent.\n"", ""\nExplain to me how Elon would be limited assuming he could buy Qualcomm components and knows how to build, idk, a Tesla 3 or a spaceship. This isn't uh, rocket science, and the apps in the app stores are all shit-tier freemium spyware. Elon's network has a lot more capital than just him alone and they understand precision manufacturing at an unparalleled level.\nI don't doubt that they could get a real competitor on the market at all. I doubt the veracity of their intention. Which is the point of the 'X' project, right? Unified application tied into hardware with an embedded model for trust? Likely using trustless applications built on the blockchain?\nWhat the fuck do we even need android or iOS for? Their spyware or lack of serious innovation since monopolization? Apple's 30% tax on the userbase or it's CEOs extremely fucked up betrayal of the American worker? Paying $1,000 for a computer you can't hook up to a keyboard an monitor, and $100 a month for the privileges of monitored and metered access to the internet?\n"", '\nThe challenge isn\'t creating the device. Elon could make his own phone whenever he wanted.\nThe challenge is getting normies, who generally don\'t make their buying decisions on the basis of politics or factors like ""breaking a monopoly"" or ""commitment to data privacy principles"", to buy his phone instead of the brands they\'re used to and already like.\nThat\'s always a huge difficulty for a new player in an established market. But with the tech oligarchies it\'s even more cumbersome to compete with them because they\'re part of the same cathedral as the media.\nSo the moment Elon launches his competitor it will be branded the ""Q-phone"" and the ""dangerous new device used by white supremacists"". News narratives will run 24/7 claiming it does everything from explode to give Elon access to your nudes. SJWs will demand it be deplatformed, and Amazon and all major brick and mortar retailers will ""cave to pressure"" and refuse to sell it.\nAnd then Elon\'s phone will be a niche product used by Elon fanboys and conservative activists, but have a tiny market share compared to apple and google and ultimately not matter. Which is not the goal. The goal is for normies to have it.\nThis is the same reason Gab, Parler, and Truth Social remain niche services, and while they are great tools for conservative organizing and making sure we have fallback positions if and when we get banned from normie sites, could never be true competitors to twitter, and .win, unfortunately, couldn\'t be a true competitor to reddit.\nAnd that\'s what made Elon buying twitter such a brilliant strategic move. Twitter is ALREADY the service normies use. Elon brought free speech to the masses instead of trying to bring the masses to free speech. Admittedly he hasn\'t been perfect in that regard but he\'s been a lot BETTER. The government couldn\'t possibly come up with a justification for blocking the sale that would pass muster with a conservative SCOTUS, Elon doesn\'t even own any businesses in the same market sector. Twitter couldn\'t refuse the deal because shareholders wouldn\'t allow it. And there was no way to deplatform Twitter, it\'s too big and too mainstream, and the people who want it already have it on their devices, what are you gonna do, forcibly delete it? Then so many people would be pissed off that Elon really COULD launch his own phone and become a major player. His would be the only phone with twitter on it. He threatened that to back them down and they caved.\nSo for once, it was the LEFT in the position of trying to convince people to abandon the platform they were already signed up to, used to using, and all their friends were on, and instead migrate to an expressly partisan platform for political reasons. And they failed just like we failed.\nThat\'s why what Elon did was so smart, but also why he can\'t just magically take over the smartphone market and outcompete apple and google whenever he wants either. Two sides of the same coin.\n', '\nThe /pol/tard take is holding you back. Drop the memetic it\'s no longer ours anyways. The adoption issue is very serious, I agree. It is a primary concern of mine. If we can fix that we can fix a lot of things. I had hoped for some regulatory approach but as you know that was raw hopium, and foolish.\nI do wonder if Musk could challenge the ""duopoly"", which is really a cartel. It is an interesting thought experiment and so far I don\'t see a reason why he couldn\'t. As for leftist deplatforming, he outed Berkley on this. That was a milestone as SJW rhetoric and labelling comes specifically from them. If he is not in on this he really, really gets it.\nI think he could launch a new device and I think it would be widely adopted. I think we\'ll see a ""cultural shift"" which will be a blowback against the woke corporatism. I think that this will be orchestrated and we would be fools to accept it then settle down.\nYou nailed the adoption issue. There is far more going on here and there is also platform abandonment. There is severe market anger as well. People are pissed. They want more than an alternative and this has held us all back.\n', ""\nBoth of you make excellent points and this polite discussion is what makes this place so different from Twitter, ironically.\nAdoption is a coin flip. The cartel of not just phones but influence would be a negative force. But Elon does have that special PR judo of turning negative headlines into buzz and sales.\nSpit balling here... An Elon Musk phone, with built in Twitter and some kind of techy encryption, and maybe able to run on his satellite network and work anywhere, that's already a huge disruptor. Get some privacy features like the ability to manually disconnect wifi, Bluetooth, audio/video and you'd get the far right, libertarians, tech snobs, and beta product people on board.

It was a mystery\n', ""\nThe whole automotive industry at the moment is a logistical nightmare and nobody seems willing and or capable of pushing back against everything they're doing. It's one of the few industries I personally believe needs a massive overhaul, starting with devising a way to force automotive companies to produce replacement parts on-demand for any models for any customer that they've created vehicles for or else be forced to give up blueprints or design plans necessary for other shops to produce the parts that would otherwise be discontinued. It coincides with Right-to-Repair efforts because major manufacturers like GM, etc. deliberately design their processes around planned obsolescence, which should be illegal. And with these stupid EVs being pushed down everyone's throats, keeping older vehicles running is going to get much more difficult to do to the point that you have no power against market forces. It's all by design and people doing this should be shot.\n"", '\nAt least push right to repair. There is a lot of things that can be done if you know how to reprogram an ECU but the EPA only wants manufacturers to have that capability.\n', ""\nAnything being pushed in that direction would be better than the nothing I'm seeing done today.

What I envision is an eventual new form of automotive platform where the overall objective is to design and create future-proofed vehicles where every single part (and accompanying procedures) are free to use to create the respective vehicle they pertain to. In concept, it would be 1:1 how open-source software works and it's my belief that it's slowly pivoting in that direction, especially the more small mom-and-pop shops keep tooling up and automating processes to increase their efficiencies.\nIs there a market for it? Absolutely, but the majority of people will poo-poo the idea, but not because there isn't a market for it... Rather, because they haven't come to understand the value of it yet, and in their defense, how can they when they're all so wound up in everyday life? The majority of people don't even change their own engine oil, let alone actually take the time to think about how gated the automotive markets are at present or how much simpler their life would be if their vehicles didn't have to represent the headaches that come from parts that become harder and costlier to find and install (as their parts' installation procedures represent institutional knowledge that is lost in time).\nMy hope is that the smaller mom-and-pop shops will continue to tool up... 3D printers that keep improving printing capabilities (especially where printing metal is concerned), mill and forge tech, CAD software used to tie it all together... Information repositories easily-accessible across the internet... It's all stuff that will improve in time and in theory, should improve peoples' lives where parts scarcity and replication is concerned. In fact, I'd go as far as to claim how our infrastructure and general nature will ensure it happens, the only question is, how long will it take to reach a mainstream manifestation like the context I'm describing.\nWe've raised entire generations who understand the value of open-sourcing things. It won't stop with software.\n"", '\nIt would be cool if there was an open source car that was made from all open source parts. Where the parts were based on specs but made by anyone. A modular car even.\n', '\nI agree but this is a 1% issue. 99% of people DGAF and have no problem paying $500/mo for a junker.\n', ""\nThey will, but it's going to take time for them to understand how this affects them and how things should be. How fast they learn that is partially dependent upon how they learn it. The more you see consumers pushing back against market forces (like we've seen with John Deere's headaches with Right-to-Repair), the more likely we'll see an ideal automotive outcome. Taking peoples' keys away with more and more restrictive (autonomous) tech will be a great incentivize for change.\n"", ""\nWell they have problems doing it, they just don't care enough.\n"", '\nAll part of the greater goal of no one owning cars anymore. Everything will be ""uberish"" but owned by the car companies themselves.\nGet ready to pay by the mile to go anywhere.\n', '\n""Guys, you\'re doing it all wrong. Those charging cables are supposed to go up your ass."" - buttgig, Larry Sinclair, and Obama probably\n', '\nSouth park was ahead of its time\n', ""\nOf course.\nThey work ok at scale IF:\nA: There is enough generation capacity (There's not)\nB: Everyone charges at home (They can't)\nC: Basically no one goes on a trip longer further than about 30-40% of their range.\nPeople go on trips far enough away from their homes to need to charge at a charging station often. Most charging stations have a tiny handful of charger, and not all of them are working at any given time. Plus each car needs to be connected for 30+ minutes at a time, at best, instead of the 5ish minutes or less for a gas pump. Once there's enough electric cars on the road, that charging station capacity is going to almost immediately be maxed out, and there's just not enough land to dedicate to the peak demands of travelers going to these stations, and that's not even mentioning all of the people who can't charge at home overnight because they live in an apartment, or the like. Add the need for those people to go to a charging station every few days just for their commute and those stations will be jam packed all the damn time.\nIf you think the stations are packed when a hurricane is approaching, that won't hold a candle to normal every day traffic at a charging station when even 50% of the population has electric cars (probably 30%+).\nAnd if there actually is a need to evacuate? Just forget about it. If you're already don't have enough of a charge, then batten down the hatches. You're not going anywhere.\nHoliday travel season? Suuure. That won't be a clusterfuck at all!\n"", ""\nIf you bought an EV and can't charge at home, you're functionally retarded. EV owners aren't going to rush to the charging stations en masse for hurricanes. They'll just charge at home like normal. Gas car owners can seethe about this convenience, but it's how it is.\nYou know how you hate selective news articles that cherry pick examples to make things look like major problems? Ever notice how those Tesla charging station lines are always in California? Back in the day, Tesla offered unlimited free supercharging miles. Combined with California's clusterfuck mismanagement of their grid and pricing, it creates the perfect storm of people who will go out of their way to not charge at their home and get the free miles. I could be given free supercharger miles right now, and I still wouldn't bother. At my electricity rate, It's barely a dent in my power bill and don't care to waste the time like I would have to go out to a charging/gas station. I have never experienced a wait at a charger, and road trips are pretty much less thought than a gas car. It plans the charging stops ahead.\nThe article acknowledges about what I get: 15 minutes for 200 miles. I also leave the house with a full charge, and I only need to arrive back home near empty. This means that if I have a 1000 mile round trip, here is how it would go:\nFirst ~300 miles, no time because charged at home.\nNext 200 miles, 15 minutes to charge\nNext 200 miles, 15 minutes to charge\nNext 200 miles, 15 minutes to charge\nLast 100 miles, ~7 minute charge then plug back in at home. Wake up to full charge.\nThat's 1000 miles for <1 hour of charging. I have never had to wait for a charging station. If you enjoy powering through for 16 straight hours, get a gas car. If you don't mind stretching your legs every 2-2.5 hours of driving on occasional road trips and never want to visit a gas station again for your daily commute, EVs are fine.\n"", ""\nRight. If you can charge at home, and there is not a lot of people with EVs, then a long trip isn't much of a problem. Once there's a bunch of people driving them, then you will have to wait for a charging station.\nThis is again assuming that there will be enough electrical capacity to charge lots of EVs. There currently isn't, and probably won't be unless we start building nuclear plants all over the place, and you know how much the left likes nuclear.\nEVs work now for the people that have them because, like you said, the ones that can charge them at home are the ones that buy them, there's not too many of them, so no overcrowding at the stations, and there's enough generation capacity for them.\nPoint is: Forcing this change with banning of ICE cars before the infrastructure is there to support them (charging stations at every parking space at apartments? Who's paying for all of this?) Is madness. But that's leftist logic for you. If this change is to happen, it needs the market to guide the change, and it needs time to happen.\n"", ""\nI think you underestimate the ability for industry to innovate to accommodate demand.\nYou wouldn't even need to upgrade the grid if there were supercap banks added to charging areas. It would effectively charge the charging station during low/moderate use and tap into it during peak demand.\nDaily commutes do not take that much power to support. Say you have a 20 mile two-way trip to work. That would be about 6 kWh. That's like 60-80 cents of electricity, not much more than a few hours of running your microwave. Then, factor in solar offsetting peak demand with grid tie inverters... this isn't exactly a doomsday scenario to gradually increase EVs on the road.\n"", '\nGreen energy is, by its very nature, a scam.\n‚ÄúDo as I say or we all get cooked alive‚Äù is the founding tenet of their weird, Neo-pagan earth-worship. They want to drag you to everyone‚Äôs salvation.\nWhich would be nice if their vision was living more self-sustainably like the Amish, where we all have chickens, a cow, eggs and milk, spend more time outdoors on rural land.\nBut their insane ideology changes every minute\n', '\nThat‚Äôs the entire point.\n', '\n""Logistical.... nightmare.....PERFECT!""\nRubs hands together and laughs manically\n', '\nSounds like we need to expand government to help manage this.

In order for people to move away from gasoline, it needs to be just that much more inconvenient (read expensive) such that other options become more viable.\n', ""\nYears ago, when talk of electric vehicles first started, I assumed that was the way it would work. But these batteries are massive and extremely expensive. https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/these-replacement-battery-costs-for-these-six-normal-evs-is-staggeringly-high\nThe only way a battery swap system would work is if everybody has both their vehicle and its current battery registered in some central database, and the batteries are outfitted with computer chips that that track their location and disable them if they're not in the same vehicle that the database shows they're supposed to be in, and the vehicles would also have to be outfitted with tracking and identifying technology to disable the vehicle if it doesn't have the right database-registered battery in it. Because professional thieves and resellers would figure out how to jailbreak the batteries. And the vehicle owner would need to have a huge financial deposit connected to the central database so if the battery disappears (or is destroyed in an accident/fire), the vehicle owner's money would disappear too. Some of these batteries cost over $20,000. And they only last about 10 years tops.\nThe whole idea of making EVs the new normal for vehicles is insane. It's going to collapse under the weight of its insanity, but not before massive amounts of capital have been chewed up and destroyed.\n"", '\nIt\'d have to work like 20 lb propane tanks. You ""buy"" a tank (battery) with your vehicle, but you just swap it out with a charged one when you need it. All of the batteries would have to be standardized and backwards-compatible. They\'d have to be regularly inspected and repaired, too. I\'m not optimistic for electric vehicles yet.\n', ""\nThe big problem is the price difference between a car battery and a 20lb propane tank. Empty propane tanks are cheap items. A deposit can be built into the price that people pay out of pocket. The actual market value of a car battery diminishes over the course of it's useful life, which is about 10 years. So if you're driving around with a 7 year old battery in your car from that last time you swapped batteries, and you pull into a battery swap station where the oldest available charged battery is only 2 years old, do you have to leave a $10,000 deposit (half the price of many new EV batteries)?\nAnd how does anyone who's taking a financial risk on these things (both users and retail level swap-renters, at a minimum) confirm the age/mileage difference on the batteries being swap (and age and mileage are separate factors in the lifespand of an EV battery). These problems are easily solved if both the batteries and the vehicles are equipped with tracking and data recording technology, in a way that's not hackable, which means constantly sending data to a central database, and disabling the battery if a security breach is detected.\nWIth ordinary gasoline, it's still possible to pay cash to fill up, provide no ID, transfer gasoline from one vehicle to another, etc. No need for tracking systems and centrally-controlled computerized vehicles.\n"", '\nYou could do the battery swap without central databases and tracking. It\'s not really worth going into the details because I don\'t believe such a battery swap system will ever be implemented, because the real intention of the EV push is to strip us of private car ownership and the freedom to travel. All these problems go away once that happens, and we\'re locked in our ""15 minute cities.""\n', ""\nThe batteries cost almost as much as the whole car. Nobody is going to run a car-swapping business without some combination of huge deposits, GPS trackers on the cars, insurance to cover the full value of the car, ID required etc. That would be basically a rental car business, whether it's whole cars or just the batteries. How do you check that the arriving battery that's being turned in for a freshly charged one is in comparable condition? We agree that such a system will never be implemented.\n"", '\nEach battery would need to be kept on a maintenance schedule, and would need to be tested for faults automatically at every swap or ""fill up"", to use an analogy. Such batteries could be designed to be easily serviceable, where individual cells could be replaced quickly by certified service centers. They\'d need to meet certain requirements before being allowed to be put back into circulation to another vehicle. The initial ""deposit"" would have to be built into the price of a new car, and used car buyers would have to ensure that the battery in the vehicle is certified and up to date before purchase. It\'s doable, but will never be done.\n', '\nWe disagree about ""doable"", but agree about ""will never be done"". Just too damn complicated, and too hard to pin down risk factors, and legally assign who carries the financial risks. Swap stations would need to be spread out all over the place, and many would be targets for organized crime operations (both outright thefts using big trucks, and tech-savvy inside operations falsely certifying the condition of batteries that are swapped out to people who swap in genuinely near-new ones. And think of the fire risk (both accidental and arson).\nWe just need to focus on shutting down the whole insane idea. Greta Thunberg is now protesting a windmill farm.

Of course if that were to happen en masse then some power grid infrastructure improvements would probably be needed.\n', ""\nUsually most towns charge less for energy at night time because less energy is being used. Well if everyone is charging cars at home at night then I'd assume energy prices will rise for everyone.\nGood job you're saving $200 on gas every month but now you're spending $250 more on electric. EVs just seem cheaper because the majority of society is subsidizing them. Once they hit 50% gas price will plummet. What will be most ironic is by the metrics govt use to be emission neutral means that because they made cars electric they can use oil as a source of energy or coal to charge the electric cars.\nNow they lost gas taxes to maintain roads, so they'll introduce taxes by miles driven.

And a huge increase in grid demand at a time of day when many grids are struggling to meet current demand. One more of many expenses which the ""greens"" try to wave away with ""magic"" hands.\nBTW, currently in ""green"" Ca;liformnia, for instance, 80-90% of the grid energy comes from non-renewables from about 8PM to 6AM.

Almost surely by clean reliable natural gas.\n', '\nCoal ... powered ... cars ...\n', '\nI wouldn‚Äôt buy an EV unless I was legally required to do so. Because fuck these people.

I wont own one as my only vehicle probably ever.\n', ""\nWithout reading the article, I'm sure they're not saying that pure battery powered electric cars are bad, or a stupid concept. I'm guessing that they're only advocating that the government should spend hundreds of billions of dollars creating an infrastructure for them.\n"", ""\nGas stations are on every corner, partially because they're convenient (the store part came later). Charging stations are a real estate problem because they aren't convenient.\n"", '\nHad they been honest in their marketing and called them ""battery-operated"" this would be less of a surprise.\n> also\nWith a little more foresight, the industry could have gone into this with a plan similar to the way people exchange propane tanks at a store. (Buying a full tank of propane costs more, exchanging an empty tank for a full one costs substantially less.) This would be also be more possible with standardizing the batteries (I don\'t know or care really, but I\'m assuming a Tesla battery is not compatible with a Prius battery.) Just as some stores have a bin of propane tanks, there could be a bin of charged-up batteries and probably an attendant to discourage theft and/or swap the batteries.\nRather than wait for several hours, one could exchange their run-down batteries for charged-up batteries. This would involve the inconvenience of manually removing/replacing the batteries, which would probably require an attendant to do this (as most ""electric vehicle"" customers would be either unable or unwilling to handle the heavy/dangerous batteries themselves, or accomplish the task correctly.)\nObviously, theft/abuse/incompetence would be an issue. Stealing a catalytic converter is relatively easy, thieves just saw them off with a stolen battery-operated saw. The batteries in an ""electric vehicle"" may be less-accessible and less-easily-removable, or we would be hearing of more cases of stolen batteries.\nBased on the nightmare stories I\'ve seen about charging times for the ""electric vehicle"" batteries (and high cost of replacement) it does seem as if trading them in could be a less time-consuming way to ""charge"" the batteries. This would possibly be prohibitively expensive, as someone would then have to charge those batteries and install the fresh ones for the customers.\n> But this is probably not feasible to begin with, due to the batteries being proprietary and not easily changed rather than charged.\n', ""\nThis whole bit about the batteries will be just like what happens with the propane tanks. Propane tanks need to be recertified periodically. Instead of doing that people will just simply exchange the tanks for a newer one.\nThe same thing is going to happen with batteries. When somebody's battery get weak they are going to exchange them for a good one and someone who ends up with this battery will be screwed because their battery will be older and will not hold the charge like the battery that they gave up in exchange.\nIn the propane situation the propane company ends up eating the cost of the certification and the new tanks. In this case it may be a person trades their perfectly good battery for an old piece of crap.\n"", '\nAlso, I\'m sure that like any popular product that uses expensive ""consumables"" there will be low-cost/low-quality ""generic"" options. I heard a friend talking of buying some sort of ""generic"" batteries for his Prius, which probably will work as well as any Chinese knock-off does.\nThere will also likely be some sort of ""core charge"" etc similar to the way certain auto parts stores will give a rebate if you bring in the bad part (as in used brake pads or master-cylinders etc.) The last time we bought a normal 12V auto battery, they gave us that rebate in return for our old battery. This is because they send them in for recycling or rebuilding, which I predict will be big business in the near-future because the ""factory replacement"" batteries for ""electric vehicles"" will be pricey- thus people will be looking for more-affordable options.\n']"

They where far more advanced and wealthier than most other nations.\n"", '\nBut you just said it was the Italians that invaded Africa implying that the Germans didn‚Äôt.\n\nNorth Africa was Mussolini, not Hitler.\n\nLol having trouble keeping your revisionist history straight?\n', ""\nHow's the weather in Tel Aviv?\n"", ""\nWouldn't know.

Brazil seems to be lost with the removal of Bolsanaro. They\'re currently working on Russia. China will be tricky, but maybe they figure out an easy solution there too as communism is centralized by design, that means they only have to eliminate whinnie the pooh and his gang, then CCP is all puppets for the new world order.\n', ""\nIts not going to go the way they want.

Basically, the entire 4 years of high school it was omnipresent. History class, German class, Art class, Religion class, even French and English classes, all of them covered the holocaust at some point.\nAnd there is no neutrality or skepticism allowed on it either, because even questioning is considered ""holocaust denial"" and literally a federal crime, so no teacher will ever tell you the truth about it (if they even know it). I never even heard about how much of the supposed evidence doesn\'t hold up to scrutiny until I came to the US, where it\'s still allowed to have your own opinion about things.\nSo instead of allowing children and young adults to come to terms with their supposed heritage on their own terms, and rescue their ancestors from this collective guilt, so speak, you get communist-style struggle sessions that won\'t end until everyone has accepted ""the truth"" and ends up holding their grandparents in contempt for their role in this crime.\nOf course, this has a profound effect on the sense of national pride that you\'re allowed to express, which is basically none whatsoever, unless we happen to win the World Cup. Instead, they tell you to take pride in making the country as international and welcoming as possible to foreigners, by sacrificing anything that makes us distinctly German on the altar of globalism.\n', '\nUnfortunately the most accurate description yet.\nAnd just like white liberal women we are currently in the process of learning that these exotic, testosterone laden men from across the sea are a weirdly bad fit for our nice neighborhood.

Rather, crumbled down into at least a few dozen more smaller countries. Meaning, NATO would have likely expanded all the way to Vladivostok ... and the US would have been supreme ruler of the world, and by extension, the Globohomo's controlling the world and the world's resources.\nAnother example, look at James Cameron and the massive influence he has had on the motion picture industry, with his movies like Terminator I & II, Titanic, Alita: Battle Angel and now Avatar I & II etc. Not to forget, the ensuing influence his movies have had on the general population in the US, Europe and Asia etc. I mean, we would not have had LeoMania, or the extent of Eco-Fascism in Western society we have today.\nOf course one can not forget Trump => the greatest political movement in American History.\nThe list goes on.\n"", ""\nWell I certainly don't put my efforts into the league of those you named. My point was more how we can do things locally.\nAs for Cameron, he's a diver here in SoCal, so I've run into him at a couple of dive show events (but never really spoke to him). He's obviously considered a celebrity, even if he's not really an elite diver.\nIt was the kelp beds off of La Jolla Cove, one of my local hangouts, that inspired the entire design of the planet in Avatar.\n"", '\nI see your point. I wasn\'t trying to diminish your actions though. I was mentioning Putin, Cameron and Trump just as given examples. And I know they are on a big scale.\nBut what you\'re doing with the Precinct Strategy is equally important. Concerning making a real change to the GOP swamp and Mittens McDaniels. Referring to all the doomers ... and people despising the current establishment and not really knowing how to make a change.\nInteresting! On a side note, I have been listening to some of Camerons 90s interviews on the Titanic .. and he seems like a decent guy. Especially, when listening to the yuge detail he put into the production of the film, including the reasons for it and why he did what he did. Ranging from the special effects to the creative decisions he made. For instance, recreating the cutlery, carpentry and decorations from the original Titanic. Notice the Grand Staircase.\nCameron is only a ""celebrity"" in what Hollyweird makes him out to be. Just like with all the other ""mainstream"" so-called A-listers, including other directors like Spielberg, but also musicians (e.g. Harry Styles), writers, producers (Weinstein) and actors (DiCaprio or Pitt etc.).\nI don\'t think Cameron has an Instagram or a YT account. He also lives in New-Zealand with his Vegan farm. He doesn\'t seem to be consumed that much with egos, but maybe I\'m wrong. For deciding to live in NZ and live a relatively low-key life with his wife, who also had a role in Titanic, as the granddaughter of the elder Rose, interestingly enough.\nOn a side note, it\'s only been in recent years that I\'ve figured more and more the military industrial complex behind Hollyweird as well. Many things have been structurally and artificially engineered. That includes movies and TV-shows, such as Friends, Sex And The City, Modern Family, Brokeback Mountain, 12 Years A Slave ... and now all this non-white-washing with The Little Mermaid etc.\nI mean, it\'s interesting reading, as an example, how many initial ""low-key"" actors spend time living in some shared home/apartment complex up in the Santa Monica Mountains etc. I mean, they are practically owned by all the agencies and managers. Almost as slaves. No wonder so many actors have ended up messed up as much as they have.\nLa Jolla! I keep that in mind should I visit.\n', '\nAs much as I enjoyed Avatar, the theme was 100% designed to push the Climate Activist agenda.\nThe indigenous people fighting back against the evil colonizers backstory was the entire point of the movie.\nThat his creative genius made it entertaining is just a sidetone. The movie was political propaganda.\n', '\nI am not the least surprised. It\'s what happens when you suddenly end up in this tangled mess of your intelligence, coupled with big business, the elites and the ""real"" world. Concerning what matters to people today ... and not advocating some radical agenda.\nAnd Cameron is not alone. Looking at the recent Oscars and Grammys etc. I mean, Cameron\'s acceptance speech at the 1998 Oscars for winning Best Picture with Titanic, seems like a world far away right now. For instance, how he asked the audience for a \'minute of silence\' for the real-life victims of Titanic ... and reflecting upon the real tragedy. You consider that ""based"" and humble in today\'s crazy world.\nNot to forget, just by comparing Avatar to Titanic. Concerning the latter was not about Climate Actvism, but about the preciousness of life (Jack\'s supposed death), Mental Health (Rose\'s attempted suicide) and taking a sneer at the, what we know today, as the wealthy, out-of-touch super elites. Concerning the vast majority of survivors being 1st Class ... and one of the owners of the Titanic sneaking on a lifeboat.

At least that‚Äôs what the courts were telling us when the election wasn‚Äôt even certified at the Federal level in 2020 (before J6, of course).\nIn this case, they told Kari Lake to wait for the election results to be certified, and then sue after. So I‚Äôm keeping my expectations low and would rather be pleasantly surprised with whatever we might get than to be massively disappointed if we expected to overturn the election and don‚Äôt get anything closely resembling that.\nAnd before the doomers try to negate everything I just said, this is, at the very least, the precedent we need so that future lawsuits can be fine-tuned to meet any claims of election engineering/fraud.

The last two and a half years has been the groundwork for 2024 or later, if the need arises.\n', '\nThe truth is once the fraud happens, it is nearly impossible to address and fix after the fact with our court system the way it is.

Funny how pdw can easily see the scams and bs when it comes to real conspiracies, but the writing is on the wall with elections. They are super rigged. You cant hope government will fix itself.

How many times do you have to fall for this scheme before you learn?\n', ""\nReally?\nBecause Ken Bennet, the guy that cuts the woman off when she begins listing counties and the number of bribed officials in them seems pretty nervous about what she'd presented. Ken was AZ State Senate liaison with Cyber Ninjas during the audit and, if in the cartel's pocket, is likely a big reason why it went nowhere despite the mountains of evidence.\nHim nervously asking about who receive the info and when is pretty telling, too.\nSeems pretty legit based on Ken's reactions.\nAnd again, you are trying to dismiss it all out-of-hand.\n"", '\nSo you‚Äôre willing to believe whatever accusations if a politician looks nervous?

His report reads like some fantasy novel with nothing to back it up, and it‚Äôs all about his ex wife and divorce.\nEven his most baseline accusations about the phony deeds don‚Äôt check out, they don‚Äôt even belong to the people he says they belong to. He presents deeds for a Katherine Hobbs. Katie Hobbs name is Kathleen. He also claims the signatures match, and they obviously don‚Äôt. This nonsense will taint any future accusations or investigations.\nBut I guess you can read about it in his book. Ugh.\n', ""\nPlus his voice and speech mannerisms.

I hope the truth comes out in court, whatever that truth is.\n"", '\nYou post under the name ""Kevin Brookshire"" over on Gateway Pundit, don\'t you?\nThis is almost verbatim the same shit he spews.\nSo it\'s either that, or you two are working from the same talking points.\nFuck off, shill.\n', '\nIt‚Äôs because these are obvious criticisms that immediately jump out to anyone with a functioning brain who reads it. I‚Äôve made my claims based on what he presented. You made your claims based on facial expressions of a politician, and can‚Äôt refute any of the criticisms.\nHave fun buying the book in 8 weeks, retard. You make us all look bad.
