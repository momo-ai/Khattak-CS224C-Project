BIG MISTAKE!!!: FULL SPEECH From James At Veritas HQ About Removal From Project Veritas
",/p/16aANFwNnx/big-mistake-full-speech-from-jam/c/,"['\nLet this be a lesson to everyone. Never willingly give up so much of your business where a table full of people can just remove you from your own company.\n', '\nUnless you really HAVE to, never go public. Papa John found that out the hard way. He went public, and all it had to take was a correct and apt comment on a company conference call about people watching football less due to Kaepernick shenanigans and therefore buying less pizza from them to get him shitcanned from the company he started from second hand equipment in...what, the 80s?\n', '\nGoing public is no longer ""going public"" and that needs to be looked at.\n', '\nYeah, ""going public"" basically means selling to the Rockefellers. They get a controlling influence leveraging other people\'s money to control the top shareholders.\n', '\nYes, it’s these retirement and mutual funds controlled by BlackRock and its owner Vanguard.\n', '\nI will always plug Strive as an ETF basket alternative. Instead of pulling out of these companies altogether, why not do what they do and pool our money and influence in a group that (at least claims) to try and affect these big companies.\nhttps://strive.com/why-strive/\n', ""\nI moved 5% of my portfolio over to Strive after the Dallas Turning Point event, where the spox for the portfolio was featured on Warroom that day. I gave them a chance and since then they performed 0.2% better than did the ETF's managed by others. May move over more to Strive shortly.\n"", '\nThis is the way.\n', '\nAnd mandated by the GOVERNMENT!\n', '\nWe need a based retirement fund\n', '\nThis. BlackRock is using our own 401k funds to control public companies and to fight against our own interests. Sick.\n', '\nwhich are all ultimately controlled by our alien overlords from Xergulon\nyou people crack me up\n', '\nIf you think what Black Rock is doing is funny, you have a sick sense of humor. It is obvious to anyone who is paying attention that corporations control our government and both parties. Politicians can not get elected anymore without bowing down to the megadonors who pick our nominees. It is sick, not funny.\n', ""\nHe's just a predictable mole playing damage control by attempts to gaslight people who notice too many things. He doesn't care about the damage the blackrock causes because he's handing out blue-pills. Just eat them and keep going about your life following the status quo peasant.\n"", ""\nno it's just fucking stupid how you doomers think everything is under the control of some evil cabal\nit's not\nthis being a shining example\n"", '\nYou should be able to decide who can and cannot buy shares. Denying large investment firms for instance, and going only with individual buyers.\n', '\nOr just do what Vince McMahon did and simply keep a controlling share of the stock\n', '\nprobably why the illegal paralegal controversy happened\n', '\nAnd it still didn’t do shit to McMahon, he came back and removed 3 board members him self, reinstated him self in charge and brought 2 of his own people in.\n', '\nThe Council of 300 has entered the chat. https://youtu.be/Sc1NxfmtOTc\n', '\nthere needs to be a limit in boards someone can be a member.\n', ""\nyou mean we are all contributing to the Rockefellers' retirement with our 401ks?\n"", '\nPublic essentially means ""not private"", as in: you open a path to your own destruction. This is generally ruthlessly used by those who want to tear you down.\nThe history of the 20th century is essentially people going ""we want! nationalize! make the government control it! boo capitalism! boo private property!"" then having very big suprised pikachu faces when the government bends them over and anally rapes them.\nDemocracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard. -H.L Mencken\n', '\nThere is risk and reward by going public. Going public means you are under public scrutiny, and people can scoop up the company you started. However, there are benefits to it which is mainly that stocks technically have no value, and that you can pass down your wealth without normal taxations. Furthermore, you can quickly sell your assets, and these assets have high valuations.\n', ""\nMusk has said going Public is a bad idea as well. Never do it unless it's the absolute last solution.\n"", '\nGotta keep a majority of voting shares, like the evil zuckerfuck. That is always a good idea.\n', '\nWould you say it would be the Final solution?\n', '\nIt’s never the last solution. It’s just greed.\n', '\nUnless you are already rich as hell you have no choice. Here is how a startup works these days:\n\n\nYou and some buddies have an idea and start a company. You have no money\n\n\nYou talk to contacts who know angel investors or venture capitalists (after all the government has rules about who can invest in startups so the era of getting your family or friends to bootstrap you are largely over).\n\n\nThose angel investors or VCs give you money in exchange for equity. That equity is almost worthless right now because there is no market to easily sell equity in small private startups.\n\n\nYour company grows and becomes more successful. Your VC investors are now demanding you accept a buyout from Google or do an IPO so they can cash out their equity.\n\n\n(a) You refuse and the VCs pool their equity together to remove you as leadership (as a condition for investment, most VC firms will already require you to give up leadership or to give majority positions on the management/board to outsiders for precisely this reason) and then have their new leader take the company public.\n\n\n5 (b) You accept and go public.\nThe decision of whether you can go public or not is made long before you ever get big enough to do an IPO. Its made the second you take investment from venture capital.\n', '\nCorporate law acts against the interests of the American people.\n', ""\nThat's because it CENTRALIZES power instead of DE-centralizing it.\n"", '\nYes.\n', '\nYes.\n', ""\nThere is an alternate plan. You start a business with a plan where you can be profitable in 1-2 years. You NEVER TAKE OUTSIDE CAPTIAL. You are the only shareholder with 100% ownership and 100% of the voting power.\nYou probably won't start a $10B business with this method, but you can start a business with $1M annual profit. (which is too small that the VCs don't care anyway)\n"", ""\nThat's true. But, something like PV wouldn't fall under that. Without its large donors it wouldn't have made any money. But, its the large donors that demanded placement of the cucks on its board.\n"", ""\nIf I'm not mistaken, PV is a non-profit. They HAVE to have a board by law. The people that got into that board were the problem. Besides, if he wasn't a non-profit, going by the books, they'd have came after him for money and tax crimes 100 times by now.\n"", ""\nthey are 501c3 but that does not mean they don't get paid\n"", ""\nThat's right, but bad people got on the board because big donors often make demands for their donations. He should name and shame the donors that wanted the backstabbers put on his board.\n"", ""\nIt is indeed a non-profit and had to have a board. People here should take a deep breath and think past the knee-jerk reaction that James O'Keefe was awesome and therefore could never become anything non-awesome.\nIn all likelihood, he did let power go to his head. He's human, and it's quite rare for any human to be immune to the negative effects of having power. Probably the board should have cracked down sooner, and perhaps prevented the problem from getting so bad that O'Keefe had to be booted out.\n"", '\nYou don’t think it had anything to do with the Pfizer story??\n', '\nThe way he would have to make something like PV work is to collect a $10 donation from 100,000 people, rather than getting $1M from a couple of people with deep pockets.\n', ""\nPeople don't have the patience for that anymore. Plus, he would have needed funding from Conservatives who don't generally hand out money to just anyone. We need to know it's someone we can trust first. Starting up a donation campaign when nobody knows who you are will go nowhere because our assumption will be that it's just another lying cuck.\n"", ""\nWhen PV first started, James O'Keefe was operating on a shoestring budget. If I was serious about starting a PV-type business, I would just self-fund it with money saved from my job until I had a reputation. (Of course, I would get fired from my job from doing PV-type things.)\n"", ""\nPv is a non profit , that's why it has a board.\n"", '\nESOP is also an alternative.\n', '\nI actually think there are some funds out there now that their entire model is to be early funders and get paid out via a return on their investment when the businesses is profitable\n', '\nMost funds want to be ""I invested in the next FaceBook"", because then you are Famous Important Investor and everyone wants to give you money or take your money.\nNobody really wants to invest in a business that has $50M recurring revenue. It\'s just too small to be worth the hassle.\n', '\nyou can do that but you are going to grow very slowly if you can grow at all\nyou are going to miss opportunities and out on a lot of money\ndepending on what you do, you may go out of business\n', '\nI agree with you. The issue is that you will get 0% market penetration without the ""right"" people promoting you. Marketing will become your other other job and very likely no one will ever hear about your amazing invention.\n', '\nThat\'s how billionaires structured the economy on purpose. Without a $$$$ marketing budget, you\'re going nowhere.\nRemember when every TV show and celebrity was saying ""Follow us on Twitter. Follow us on FaceBook."" That was free advertising. If you had a better website, but didn\'t have celebrities pushing it, you wouldn\'t have been successful.\nYou CAN bootstrap. There are some indie game developers I follow even though they have no mainstream promotions. You won\'t make $100B, but you can earn a $1M/year living.\n', '\nTo continue...\n\n\nYou now have to answer to demands from the board, including the understanding that they have their own Deep State Bosses controlling them. So you either capitulate to their business demands or...\n\n\nYou don\'t capitulate to their demands and get fired anyway. Now PV will put in their OWN guy who will now go through and....\n\n\nGo through the previously confidential records and disclose all PV agents\' identities as well as still-confidential whistleblowers and expose them, and not only fire them, but even more sinisterly, FORCE them into disclosing ""information"" that will fully destroy not only PV\'s now-irrelevant journalistic presence, but maybe even create... as in ""contrive""... enough criminal charges.\n\n\n(And NOW you know why the FBI was REALLY involved when they raided O\'Keefe last year!)\n', ""\nthis has nothing to do with the FBI\nthis was clearly Pfizer's doing\nthey wanted the bioweapons for profit report shut down and they succeeded\nthey more than likely threatened the company with a massive lawsuit that would keep them in court for years if they did not discredit O'Keefe\nthat's why O'Keefe is going so quietly\n"", ""\nThe FBI is Pfizer's...and the Deep State's... enforcement arm. All family related.\n"", '\nPfizer does not need the FBI\n', '\nAll Deep State corporations need ""partnerships"" with countries\' top law enforcement organizations, such as the FBI in the United States, at least to note who NOT to go after in ANY capacity, and in fact to use the FBI to go after their competitors.\n', ""\nI hadn't thought about that part of it. Evil\n"", ""\n\nIts made the second you take investment from venture capital.\n\nthen don't\n"", '\nThen Bill Gates sees your idea, steals it and integrates it in the next version of his operating system.\n', '\nKek - true.\n', ""\nYeah that means you'll never start a business unless you already have money and a cash flow. You're not getting a bank loan for a business that won't immediately be profitable. Without VC money you're limited to your own pockets or having wealthy friends/family who qualify to invest in your business.\n"", '\nThen you probably don’t grow.\n', ""\nthat's the whole idea of investing\nit's not always VCs, there are other ways to get funds and other kinds of investors\nVCs don't usually get involved until the business is a growing concern that is showing some potential\nthey want to make money so they want some control over how you spend their money\nyou allow them to do that by taking their funds and giving them part ownership of the company\nthey are not some bunch of altruists that just want to see you succeed\ny'all are like liberals with this evil capitalism shit\n\nafter all the government has rules about who can invest in startups so the era of getting your family or friends to bootstrap you are largely over\n\nuntrue\n"", '\nN\n', '\nI\n', '\nG\n', '\nG\n', ""\nPV wasn't public.\n"", ""\ncounter point: I think most people who give a shit about PV know James is PV\nPV has zero reputation\nJames O'Keefe has a reputation\nYes, it's clear that RINO/Liberal/Desanctionious gave PV millions of dollars to own the company so they could destroy it at the most opportune time\nWell here we are, this was the event that caused them to pull the ripcord.\nAt least to me, nothing changed.

First one is almost done being edited. I\'ve laid down the foundation for all the others.\nI\'ll send you a free copy when I am done. Here are some sample chapters:\nChapter 3 - Ashita no Joe\n""Ashita no Joe"" is a classic series from 1970 about a young orphan named Joe who discovers he has a knack for punching people. Directed by Osamu Dezaki, the series has stood the test of time and continues to be a popular favorite among anime fans.\nThroughout the show\'s run, the animation style is certainly not as polished as contemporary anime. Still, the fight scenes are intense and well-choreographed. What sets ""Ashita no Joe"" apart from other similar anime is its emphasis on the emotional and psychological aspects of the sport.\nThe series also delves into the compelling motivations and struggles of the characters. Joe\'s journey from a delinquent to a professional boxer is a powerful and emotional one, with the audience rooting for him every step of the way. The story is full of raw emotion and tackles themes such as friendship, personal growth, and the consequences of one\'s actions.\nHis coach, Danpei, the wise old veteran who\'s seen it all, acts as both a mentor and a father figure to Joe and is the heart and soul of the show. Their relationship is central to the series, and it is engaging to watch him keep Joe in line with his no-nonsense attitude and great sense of humor. Danpei is willing to go to great lengths to help Joe reach his full potential.\nRikiishi, a rival boxer, is the main antagonist of the series. He\'s skilled and powerful and develops a grudge against Joe for defeating him in the past. His drive is fierce, but his ego and tendency to let his emotions and pride cloud his judgment often lead to violent outbursts and a reckless fighting style. Despite these flaws, he is a complex and well-developed character driven by his personal demons and motivations.\nWhile the series\' pacing can be slow at times, it is worth sticking with it to see the payoff. ""Ashita no Joe"" is not just about boxing; it\'s a story about friendship, determination, and perseverance that will resonate with audiences of all ages. It also tackles issues such as poverty, social inequality, and the power of the media. These themes are particularly relevant to the time period in which the anime was produced, but still resonate with audiences today.\nIf you liked Ashita no Joe, you might also enjoy the anime shows ""Tetsujin 28-go"", ""Giant Robo,"" ""Captain Harlock,"" and “Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato.""\nChapter 13 - Den-noh Coil\n""Den-noh Coil is a wild ride that will have you questioning your reality. It\'s like if ""The Matrix"" and ""Ready Player One"" had a baby, but instead of Keanu Reeves, you get a bunch of cute anime kids.\nThe series, produced by Madhouse and directed by Masaki Tachibana, takes place in the near-future where people have the ability to fully immerse themselves in virtual worlds using devices called ""Den-noh Goggles."" The story follows a group of children who use their goggles to explore the virtual world and uncover its secrets.\nNow, you might be thinking ""Oh great, another anime about virtual reality, how original."" But trust me, ""Den-noh Coil"" takes it to the next level. The show explores themes of technology, VR, and the nature of reality itself in a way that will make your brain hurt (in a good way).\nOne of the main themes is the relationship between technology and society. The show is set in a world where virtual reality technology is highly advanced and widely used, and it explores the ways in which this technology has changed the way people interact with one another and with the world around them. Characters in the show struggle with the question of how much they should rely on technology and whether it is ultimately beneficial or detrimental to their lives.\nThe show raises questions about what is real and what is not and whether the virtual world is just as real as the physical world. Characters in the show are often faced with whether they should trust their senses and what they see in the virtual world or question the reality of what they are experiencing.\nThe anime also explores the impact of new technologies on human relationships. Characters in the show are shown to be isolated and disconnected from one another, which is often attributed to their over-reliance on technology. As the characters question the role of technology in their lives, they also begin to form deeper connections with one another and the world around them.\nDen-noh Coil also touches on identity and how the virtual and physical world can shape it. Characters in the show question the extent to which their online and offline personas differ and whether they truly know themselves. The anime also shows how people can be shaped by their experiences in the virtual world and how that experience can affect their real lives.""\n', '\nYes we should start making fag sacrifices.\n', '\nThrow a bundle of sticks on the fire\n', '\nGlad this finally got Stickied.

Young girls/women really do want that and the movies & books just reflect it.\n""Then, one day, her one great love teaches her a lesson that she never gets over:\nThat no matter what she does\nWhat she tries to offer\nWhat she looks like\nHow great she is in bed\nor anything else\nShe will never, ever be enough for him.\nHe\'ll always have female \'friends\' on the side that she\'s not supposed to know about\nand he will fk other women. Then, when she finds out, he\'ll tell her that it was just sex and sex means nothing... even though she thought it did.\nSo, the one thing women want most in life - a man she loves who truly loves her in return and doesn\'t need any other women for sex or \'friendship\' -\nis the one thing she can never have.\nShe will only be told how unrealistic and stupid that is and get an immediate, overwhelming argument about how he should be \'allowed\' to spend time with \'female friends\' if he wants to because everybody has \'friends.\'\nHe doesn\'t argue that he wants to spend more time with her. He argues about how much time he can spend with his female \'friends.\'\nShe never forgets this.\nAnd that\'s why women are crazy.\nEpilogue: Women react to this in different ways. Some decide they\'ll do the same thing as men are free to do and fk their way through life, taking whatever and whoever they want - but women still get emotionally involved through sex until they have so many partners that they can\'t bond anymore.\nOr they start drinking/drugging to kill that bond, and to kill that pain of knowing she\'ll never have the life she really wants because that\'s just the way it is.\nA whole lot of them get angry and bitter and stay that way for life. We\'ve all seen that. And this is where it comes from. Was she like this at 16? Almost certainly not. But at some point she found out how things really are and now she is angry, bitter, and miserable.\nin the worst cases, she will find out how stubborn, angry, nasty, and violent he can get if she dares to interfere with his girlfriends. This is how domestic violence happens. This is how wives get killed. Look again. You\'ll see it.\nNature has played a cruel trick. Young women want a strong romantic bond that lasts a lifetime, while young men just want to screw their way through life and have The Best of Both Worlds - a comfy wife at home with all the fun of secretly dating on the side - and honestly don\'t see what\'s wrong with that as long as they\'re paying the bills.\nWho wins? The one who is strongest and cares the least. That\'s why it\'s a man\'s world.\nAnd that\'s why women are crazy.\nPlease remember I\'m just the messenger here. Yes, i\'m only reporting one side as it was given to me by an actual woman. I looked again, as she suggested I do, and I started seeing it, too.\nYes, I know you have all kinds of stories about how bad women can be to men etc etc. But right now I\'m just giving the other side. Use or discard the advice as you like.\nBut if you look a little closer at the crazy women in your life, and look for that inciting incident where she found out how she\'ll never be enough to have a man want/need only her for love, sex, and companionship - you\'ll see it. I\'ll be very surprised if you don\'t.\n', '\nThere are many of us who married our one love and saw her as exactly that. The thought of wanting other women on the side is repulsive and alien to me.

That sounds like justification for why they themselves do bad things in a relationship. I'm not saying that it doesn't happen, because I've seen it before, but regular guys are not like that. I've witnessed an investment banker that was on the phone to his wife and the match website was up on his computer. I didn't start to whore things up until my 40s, but frankly it is too much work to juggle women for what you get out of all that time and effort.

There are general security certs like Sec+, CASP+, SSCP, CISSP, etc, and there are cloud security (CCSP) or network security CCNP Security, CCIE Security tracks. You might know all this, but I see people in our field spread out like that, which is probably fine for beginners but long term it's not sustainable, the cost and continuing education requirements of all the different certs gets overbearing and you end up with certs that aren't relevant to your day to day and over time you usually lose that proficiency so the cert becomes meaningless resume fodder.\nIn the end though, money aside, I recommend sticking with the stuff you enjoy the most, and once you've been in the field a few years pursing leadership track certs is another thing to look at if you want to go the management route instead of the technician/analyst/engineer route.\nYou'll find the most success, enjoyment, and by extension money in something you enjoy.

Personally I have been fucked over many times by chargebacks due to what I sell I can’t dispute the dispute and win, and customers know this, so the very few who do realize they can just file a chargeback and they know I cannot fight it. Not to pat myself on the back, and maybe it’s just a testament to the mostly honest nature of Americans, but on a typical year back when my biz was at its peak, we’d do like 30,000 transactions per year and have less than 10 chargebacks, one year 5 from 2 people, so I’m bitching about a few hundred dollars. That’s a 0.016% ratio, processors will shut you down usually if it’s in the 3% range. Also, if a customer files too many chargebacks the card issuer will probably close their account because they’re clearly a scammer.\nOur side needs to use chargebacks especially against places who claim to be on our side but turn bad. Use them carefully.\nAnother shitty example of chargebacks from when I was in the razor thin margin small restaurant business, a big company would always place delivery catering orders, but if the receipt didn’t make its way to a lady in accounting she’d ask no questions and just file a chargeback to get a copy of the receipt.

JD Vance\'s silly stunt was just a silly stunt, which didn\'t provide any evidence of derailment-related pollution in that creek (or any pollution, since as many people have pointed out, that kind of sheen can be produced by normal bacteria and decaying organic matter).\nIf a substance that\'s lighter than water was dumped or leached into the creek by anything related to the derailment, it wouldn\'t be buried in sediment on the bottom and come to the surface when the bottom is scraped with a stick. It\'s lighter than water and would have stayed on top of the water and been washed downstream, with any residue being left on the banks of the creek and around solid objects that project from the water.\nBoth Fox News and Newsmax were running footage yesterday of an apparent meth-head shouting about his ""symptoms"" and how he\'d had to go to the hospital and was so scared that he nearly had a heart attack. He was scared by a combination of media hype and meth-driven anxiety/paranoia, and I\'m sure smoking or snorting meth also does sucky things to your throat and lungs.\n', '\nSorry, but you absolutely cannot discharge into the environment that amount of chemical waste and it not have a detrimental effect. Then to have the locals sign away their rights? NO, the situation is very bad, never mind any crack heads taking advantage. I lived in an industrial town (Solvay, NY, 1980\'s) that occasionally had leaks and believe me it ain\'t good on any level. Don\'t minimize how terrible this is, or excuse how little the resident admin is doing to ""help"".\n', '\nNobody is saying it has ""no detrimental effect"". But a lot of the specifics that are getting massive media coverage just don\'t make sense. Somebody\'s cat died and it\'s obviously because of the derailment pollution? Media companies and politicians thrive on wild exaggerations.\nAlso, a lot of the people who are complaining of headaches, sore throats, and the like may well have had some triggering exposure to irritating chemicals before and during the evacuation, and are still experiencing symptoms from that. This is not evidence that all the air and water tests that are coming back as safe now are fake.\nLikewise the presence of an unusual number of dead fish and birds is likely related to pollution from the derailment, but that doesn\'t prove anything about the present levels of pollution or about the presence of pollutants that are dangerous to humans. If you change the water in an aquarium and don\'t either add dechlorinating substance to the tap water or give it a few hours to sit so any residual chlorine will evaporate off, the pet fish will die, but that doesn\'t mean there\'s anything unsafe about the water for humans. The dead fish will continue to float in the aquarium long after the chlorine is gone. Overheating Teflon-type cooking pans can emit particles that quickly kill pet birds in the home, but don\'t cause any symptoms at all in humans.\nI haven\'t read any details about the claims that local residents were asked to ""sign away their rights"", but claims to that effect have been made about offers of immediate small payments to affected people, and also about people who were having their home water supply tested. In the latter case, they were probably asked to sign a standard form that the testing company uses for all residential testing, to protect themselves from potentially massive expenses from lawsuits which would in many cases be baseless.\nSuch forms often spell out basic reality, like that the test only covers specific substances, and can\'t guarantee that the water (or air or paint or soil) doesn\'t contain any potentially harmful substances at all. There is no way to avoid this, as it\'s quite impossible to test for absolutely everything. Chemical testing isn\'t magic; it requires specific processes, all of which take time and money. If they test your walls for lead paint and the result comes back negative for lead, that doesn\'t mean it\'s safe to eat the peeling/chipping paint, and the testing company has to protect itself by spelling this out.\nClaims about being asked to ""sign their rights away"" for an immediate payment of $1000 or so are probably false, and rooted in warnings from ambulance chasing lawyers who have already descended upon the town. Most people can\'t understand the legalese in documents associated with such payments, and lawyers are warning them not to sign anything because it might contain some waivers of their rights.\nI need to see actual copies of the documents people claim they\'re being asked to sign, before I\'ll believe these stories.\n', '\nThe form was posted online, and here on TD as well. All the chemicals, a total of 4 different ones I believe, are very dangerous. In various forms, they cause lingering damage to the water, the soil, and the air. Altering them from their transport form, by burning and mixing with the other chemicals present, along with whatever else was burning, will cause additional problems.\n', '\nVinyl chloride (gas)\nIsobutylene (gas)\nButyl acrylate (liquid)\nEthylhexyl acrylate (liquid)\nEthylene glycol monobutyl ether (liquid)\nBenzene (liquid) residue present in train cars from previous shipments\n', '\nMeanwhile, Biden is tripping around the bathroom with his Depends around his ankles.\n', ""\nAt least he's not signing anything....\n"", ""\nI hope he takes necessary precaution.

He’s been one of the only mainstream media figures covering this psyop. So I’ll chalk this up as a win, and remain hopeful that the raw footage will eventually become available for all to see. Again: 40,000 hours would take a single person almost seven years to view\n', ""\nThis is not a win. This attitude is why conservatives lose so fucking much. By releasing this through Tucker, only those who even watch Tucker are going to buy what he says. By releasing it all to the public, there's no way for normies to dispute it. We cannot keep being okay with watered down MAGA.\n"", '\nTake the Twitter Files, for example. They were publicly available, and handled by actual journalists who weren’t even considered “conservatives”. They showed a clear violation of the US Constitution, circumventing the civil liberties of American citizens. What came of it? Nothing. If the left-leaning mainstream media didn’t ignore it completely, they brushed it off as conspiracy theories. Perhaps the strategy of releasing to Tucker this time will yield different results, I don’t know. Tucker lives rent free in the heads of the establishment because they know so many people watch his show. They won’t be able to dismiss the findings so easily. Hell, they just called Seymour Hersh a, “blogger”, FFS\n', '\nThis is what I was going to say and it’s a perfect example. Normies are not going to download torrents of footage and view it for hundreds of hours. They will however watch a 15 minute Tucker Carlson monologue and see that they have been lied to and that may be enough for them or it could start them on this rabbit hole of 100% lies from our government for many decades.\n', '\nWhat ""Normies"" can do is divide that footage into digestible chunks and go through it collectively. What\'s Tucker\'s team going to be able to do?\nPlus Tucker\'s a grifter, answerable to his bosses who are, at the very least, friendly with deep staters.\n', '\nMost of the Twitter Files were dropped on Friday nights or Sunday afternoons, literally such bad times to release news that even the MSM doesn’t do it, and government does it on purpose.\nWhoever was in charge of when that stuff was posted needs to be beaten to death with a shovel.\nNot to mention that only 8% of Americans are on Twitter, and of the Americans on Twitter maybe 80% of them are left leaning. Or haven’t you heard every opinion posted here about Twitter since they banned Trump in January 2021?\n', '\n""We may have lost this one, but we\'re still great statesmen who acted with dignity""\nUntil Donald Trump came along I never had much use or respect for either party. In fact I still don\'t.\n', '\nIt just proved what we always suspected\n', ""\nI tell people that those in the government, media, et al., are unworthy of respect. The same people who try to cultivate a sense of decorum are the same ones raping kids and committing other crimes. Fuck 'em!\n"", '\nI agree with one additional raised point: how many people here would honestly, if given full access all footage, spend the hours necessary to review, investigate, and then verify all the footage to be able to present it in a way that can’t be repudiated easily?\nHow many of us volunteered to be poll watchers, how many of us protested for election integrity after the midterms? How many of us are willing to put our name and reputation on the line for truth?\nWhat I’m getting at here is we might say we want access to the full information, but we honestly don’t have the skills nor infrastructure to digest, process, and then present the data in a way that the general public can understand.\nEven worse, giving the full information to bad actors is terrible because they will then abuse the information to push false narratives that will completely discredit our honest work (Look at the election “release the kraken” stuff that basically set back our legitimate requests for election transparency)\nThe only thing that remotely gets close were the Biden “I did that” stickers on gas station pumps, and even then it was so low information and un actionable that we stopped doing it ourselves.\n', '\nDistributed collaboration is the answer. Nobody has to review every single hour, we just need thousands to watch a random 30m, and a call out anything fishy with timestamps.\nThat\'s how we went through the mail-in ballot receipts. Nobody looked up all 100k names, but thousands of us checked a handful of names and reported any dead people we found voting. And before you bitch ""what have you even done"" we did that. Hundreds of posters here on TD/PDW did that, myself included.\nBad actors already have ALL the footage and already released the most damning portions to CNN.\n', '\nThank you and many for your hard work, I tried my part as well, and sorry that we have enough shills here who nullified the honest hard work with garbage data, red herrings, and “look over there’s” that discredited the legitimate work we did.\n', '\nYou could easily look back at the stolen 2020 election and see plenty of threads and such that did exactly that. Myself included. We viewed hours upon hours of video, then took important parts and made them more easily accessible for others and then the gateway pundit stole our research and passed it off as their own.\nSo yes. We would in fact search through those hours of video.\n', ""\nYup, I was the one that got the TGP to report on re-running ballots. I also was the one that the election board had a meeting and the Zoom meeting was public and they said that there was X amount of ballots left and then later Ratface said it was like 4 times the number of ballots left. The same guy even said they'd be done that day, and then next thing we know it took them like 3 weeks longer to count the ballots.\n"", '\nNot really the point.\nImagine saying, ""I won\'t release this because nobody will watch it"".\nNot even a real argument. Just noise.\n', ""\nPlus release it to everyone and Tucker's team can still do exactly what they would have anyway. But they also get integrity checked.\n"", '\nNot my point either. We need more Seymour Hersh-style or Tucker Carlson-style coverage for the general public more than we need more Mike Lindell-style coverage, or for that matter the vast majority of us here can have the exact truth but have our research nullified by shills and fedboys. We do need the footage to be more accessible, yes, but not at the risk of having a Ray Epps kind of person throw the whole group into chaos with fake diversions.\n', '\nIf it’s physical footage (not already uploaded online somewhere) or is online but not in a publicly accessible place, what’s your suggestion on instant public release?\n', ""\nI'm about as far from a doomer as you can get but this isn't a win. This is at best a tactical defeat and a victory for state media disinformation. There may only be 10 hours of FBI bad actors actively breaking the law and those 10 hours will never see the light of day.\n"", ""\nYou mean he is the perfect canary. Remember fox legitimized the steal by calling AZ and he wouldn't touch hunters laptop until it was more or less irrelevant as an election issue.\n"", ""\nDidn't want to harm his personal friend Hunter.\n"", '\nThis is not released.

So anything ""explosive\' will be ignored.\n', ""\nHe's basically a pressure valve. He says enough to get people angry but not enough to inspire change.\n"", '\nIt’s like the Twatter files it seems, sucked there too.\n', '\nWhy not give them to everyone?\n', '\nYou know why.\nThat would lead to accountability of the establishment. And they just can’t have that. So they will release maybe half to the media, for them to release maybe 10% of that half. And they will say look we gave it to you, and the public will just say ok thanks.\n', '\nBingo!\nDead Center!\nSpot On!\n', ""\nAnd retards here will cheer it on as the winningest winning we've ever done you doomer faggot.\n"", '\nLmao\n', ""\n\nAnd retards here will cheer it on as the winningest winning we've ever done you doomer faggot.\n\nhttps://patriots.win/p/16aANEoGGb/x/c/4TrH7e4sxAG\nYep...\n"", ""\nIt also ensures that everyone outside the Fox News primetime viewership only hears that it's muh Russian disinformation and it gets memory holed.

Don't bitch about it when you become a political prisoner - because nobody can help you. Whether you take the anal rape, beatings, gouging out eyes bitching or crying or silent ... it'll still happen to you.\nSome of these people expect to give their life away for a song. They expected to have constitutional rights and protections and due process and blah blah blah. Bro, you went to protest a STOLEN ELECTION. You should have expected to get jailed, get shot, and if you came home to see your house on fire and your family crying. That's the price people pay when they show up sometimes and if you're not ready, it's okay, stay home - this game isn't for you.\n"", ""\nI didn't expect to live. Hell, at that point in my life, I didn't even want to. I had just been enduring shit at my job for months over masking and social distancing which I refused to go along with. I was physically assaulted by a manager and they tried to fire me over it because the manager was a black guy and the race riots of 2020 were currently in progress. So they were always busy bending the knee to BLM. They wanted to so badly but couldn't because it was all on video. 6 months later I was fired over made up bullshit right before Christmas. General public was still all about lockdowns and masks and I watched the election get stolen as I stayed up all night and watched the results come in live. Watched as the country I loved, my home, ideals that I had signed my name on a dotted line to serve and protect before, was being murdered right in front of me.\nSo yeah, I was pissed, poor, unemployed, feeling hopeless and a man with nothing to lose. Death was an acceptable outcome for me at that point, just so long as I could send some evil ones to hell first.\nI'm not a fool though. I'm not going to do anything to hurt the cause I still (perhaps foolishly) believe in. If I had gone in solo with guns ablazing, it would have given the evil ones everything they wanted. I'm also well aware that I'm not naturally charismatic enough to be any sort of public leader for the MAGA movement. That's why I waited for the word to act from the man who is. I know I'm not the only one that was standing by and waiting for the word that day either.\nWhat I am though is a patient man. So just like I did back then, I'll wait for the right time to act, because when I take the initiative, I'll only get 1 chance to do that. Until then, I don't comply with the occupying regime's orders and if they ever decide to come for me, well that'll make it real easy to know that it's my time to act, and I know that I'm not alone in this line of thinking either.\n"", '\n\nBro, you went to protest a STOLEN ELECTION\n\nSeems like people think this shit is a game. They fucking murdered a woman who breached a door in the hallway where reps were.\nKills me how stupid people were.

There were agitators there that were so obvious it was painful ... right next to asian christians LITERALLY singing kumbaya. But 99% of people left and didn't even get beyond the lawn.

Not only had the saying been tossed around by the French media for about 100 years before she was born (no, fake news is not new), it would have been extremely out of character for her. In fact it was reported that she spent much of her allowance to obtain food that the staff at Versailles would hand out the back door to local women that would come to the palace to receive.\nBeyond that, yes she was born a little rich girl, but she never had hopes or even the likelihood of becoming a queen as she was one of many children in her family. Her mother, the queen of Austria cut a deal with France for her to marry the dauphine of France in an effort to end hostilities between France and Austria by uniting their families. She dutifully complied, as if she had a choice, and left home for france at a young age. Since she was never supposed to become a queen, she was woefully uneducated and had much to learn, and she made the effort to do so.\nShe was so uncomfortable with her role, she spent much of her life trying to mentally escape her role. On the grounds of Versailles is the little potemkin village she would retreat to and pretend she was a peasant.\nHer husband, Louis XVI, dauphine of France, and later king, also never had desire to become king and wasn’t very good at it. Unlike his father and grandfather, he was actually a decent guy, but he suffered physical and mental issues that largely left him unable to deal with the administrative part of running a country. Much to her credit, Marie Antoinette stepped up to the plate and ran the country when Louis was not able to.\nWhile being born into and enjoying levels of privilege, wealth and comfort you and I can’t even really imagine, the pair also suffered through a number of tragedies and indignities before unfairly having their heads lopped off.\n', '\nIf you haven\'t already, I highly recommend you read ""To Quell The Terror"" by William Bush.

It is not effective. It doesn\'t make anyone\'s life better. And it slows everything down at great expense to everyone.\nWe used to think that everyone would be able to afford their own airplane to fly themselves from their garage to the local airstrip, and then catch a flight on a regional airline to the nearest major city, where they could catch a flight on a national airline to the anywhere in the world. Airplanes were supposed to be like busses. They show up, load up, and fly off, multiple flights each day, and on popular routes, flights every 10 minutes.\nThat was the original vision.

Until you get Jetsons style flying vehicles, ground transportation will always be the standard for most travel.

Therefore, most people will take the least regulated/stressful form of transportation until it's inefficient to do so.\n"", ""\nI don't know that I completely agree with that idea\nA prop plane is probably simpler than a modern car. Fewer parts, older parts, more generic parts.\nA prop plane's engine is way simpler than a modern's car engine too. You cut off everything that weighs anything, and you leave only the parts that do real work. And then you build in tolerances so that it will keep on working when conditions aren't perfect, like high elevation or cold temperatures.\nHaving seen how prop planes work, I think they are simpler than cars. They're closer to go-karts than people realize.\nJet engines, however, are a different beast. Jet engines have insanely high RPMs and so the tolerances are much tighter. The materials used are also exotic and unusual. That said, it's no more difficult to understand how a jet engine works compared to an ICE.

We don\'t have that, they are more advanced than us! We need it!""\nYet, they don\'t consider the practicality of what they say.\n1st) Passenger trains are pretty exclusive to cities in America. Our subways look and work in the same way all subways do (minus the trash and grafiti from NIPOCs).\n2nd) All of those countries are small where it is cheaper and more proficient to move people via rail than plane. (InB4 ""but china is big!) Look at Chinese population centers on a map, they are all clustered near the water and that\'s where there train system operates. Come back to me in regards to high speed rail when over one billion people live along the Atlantic coast from Boston to the Carolinas, then we\'ll talk.\n3rd) Going off of my second point, America has urbanized cities all over the country. It is cheaper, more efficient, and faster for someone to take a plane from LA to NY than a high speed train. Not to mention more energy efficient. The average flight from NY to LA is 5 hours. A high-speed train taking the straightest possible route (impossible) and going 250 mph would take 10 hours.\n4th) The overwhelming majority of cross country trains in America are used to haul materials and freight. You\'re not moving freight with a high speed train. It would take massive amounts of energy to getting it going up to speed and massive amounts of energy to slow it down. No country uses high speed rail for freight and if they do, it\'s in quantities that are so small, they are irrelevant. (PS, imagine if the East Palestine derailment happened on a bullet-train going 150 or 250 MPH)\n5th) The US doesnt practically need a country-wide bullet-train network. It may make sense in smaller Megalopolis\' (economic areas consisting of multiple metropolitan areas) and we do already have something like that with a train that runs from DC to NY.\nHowever, in those cases, since those areas are so close, it\'s easier for someone to just drive their personal vehicle and not have to spend extra on rentals plus the gas.\n6th) Last and not least, diversity. Yep, do you know why many American subways are trash? Because of joggers and mentally ill homeless ruin the shit out of public transportation. Now, high-speed rail is either cheap enough for everyone to use as they want (meaning trash and low level scum ruin it for everyone else) or it\'s priced high enough that allows for security and leaves hood rats out but by that point, you might as well fly anyway.\n(BuT iT dOeSn\'T hAvE tO rEpLaCe fLiGhTs, iT cAn SuPplEmEnt tHeM!)\nWell, which is cheaper? Building a few more plans, runways, and some more ATCs at a dozen or so airports or clearing/grading miles upon miles of land (not to mention all the private land that would have to be purchased) to build networks of high-speed rails plus the infrastructure to support them? What do you think an investor will choose?

As long as it works well enough, there is no reason to invest the money to upgrade it.\nTHAT SAID...\nThere is NO REASON why our rail companies should not be extremely profitable and at the same time offer freight for the lowest price in the world. Our train tracks should be adequate if not superior for the job.\nThe reason WHY our rail companies are not making money and why our transport network is broken and outdated is because of GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE. After all, if you want to make money in America you have to bribe your way through the red tape and buy enough politicians to rubber-stamp your legislation, which is, more often than not, designed to screw everyone else to benefit you a little bit. Rather than choose to work harder and better and take risks, America's businesses have decided to hire lobbyists and feed at the teat of government. THEY DESERVE WHAT THEY GET. We should have been burning down capitol buildings instead of begging to get a slice of the pie!\nWhen it comes to high-speed rail, America doesn't want it nor do we need it. If you can't wait a week for your cargo to work through the rail system (taking advantage of every cost-cutting measure known to mankind), then you can pay to haul it over our highway system, or pay to fly it from one of our many airports. These specialize in certain kinds of transportation, and together they should solve all of the transportation needs that America has.\nBut after DECADES of rule by foreign occupation, our country is finally feeling the effects. Our enemies hate us and want to exterminate us. The quicker we identify the true enemy, and take action to punish them or at the very least neutralize them, the quicker we can get back to creating America.\n""]"

But they had to completely fuck it all up.\nThanks to WWII's chaos and carnage the Japanese WWII military veterans which were still amazing and well-trained warriors were banned from helping out anti-communist forces in the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War.

We can't even represent our interests without being labeled supremacists even though it has nothing to do with supremacy.\n"", '\nMy very own mother has called me ""white supremacist,"" ""science denier,"" ""conspiracy theorist,"" and ""holocaust denier."" This is all because i opposed the vax and coof lockdowns. Its amazing what the TV programming can do to someone. Ohh and when i brought up the Hunter Laptop 3 years ago, I was ""gullible"" and that ""deep fakes are common."" Anything to protect their own satisfaction and convenience. Anything but the truth.\n', '\nThis why they tried so hard to shut down churches, pubs, and family gatherings for close to two years. They needed the only window a person had to be the TV.\nIt worked on far too many.\n', '\nUnfortunately I discovered sites like this one rather than watching more TV, lol.\n', '\nFrom ""Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism"" 1961, Robert J Lifton\n\n1 Milieu Control.\n\nThis involves the control of information and communication both within the environment and, ultimately, within the individual, resulting in a significant degree of isolation from society at large.\n\n2 Mystical Manipulation.\n\nThe manipulation of experiences that appears spontaneous but is, in fact, planned and orchestrated by the group or its leaders to demonstrate divine authority, spiritual advancement, or some exceptional talent or insight that sets the leader and/or group apart from humanity, and that allows a reinterpretation of historical events, scripture, and other experiences. Coincidences and happenstance oddities are interpreted as omens or prophecies.\n\n3 Demand for Purity.\n\nThe world is viewed as black and white and the members are constantly exhorted to conform to the ideology of the group and strive for perfection. The induction of guilt and/or shame is a powerful control device used here.\n\n4 Confession.\n\nSins, as defined by the group, are to be confessed either to a personal monitor or publicly to the group. There is no confidentiality; members\' ""sins,"" ""attitudes,"" and ""faults"" are discussed and exploited by the leaders.\n\n5 Sacred Science.\n\nThe group\'s doctrine or ideology is considered to be the ultimate Truth, beyond all questioning or dispute. Truth is not to be found outside the group. The leader, as the spokesperson for God or all humanity, is likewise above criticism.\n\n6 Loading the Language.\n\nThe group interprets or uses words and phrases in new ways so that often the outside world does not understand. This jargon consists of thought-terminating clichés, which serve to alter members\' thought processes to conform to the group\'s way of thinking.\n\n7 Doctrine over person.\n\nMembers\' personal experiences are subordinated to the sacred science and any contrary experiences must be denied or reinterpreted to fit the ideology of the group.\n\n8 Dispensing of existence.\n\nThe group has the prerogative to decide who has the right to exist and who does not. This is usually not literal but means that those in the outside world are not saved, unenlightened, unconscious, and must be converted to the group\'s ideology. If they do not join the group or are critical of the group, then they must be rejected by the members. Thus, the outside world loses all credibility. In conjunction, should any member leave the group, he or she must be rejected also.\n\n\n', '\nThey\'re still trying to prevent people from gathering in groups. Why do you think they\'re pushing so hard for people to do online grocery shopping? I used to say the grocery store was the one place EVERYONE would have to go eventually. There\'s always something someone needs from there, so naturally it also becomes a community hub.\nNow they\'re pushing, and pushing HARD for people to avoid going to supermarkets which makes absolutely no sense for supermarkets from a business standpoint. Supermarkets thrive on impulse purchases and with online shopping/ordering/delivery that all disappears. No more, ""I saw that on the end cap and wouldn\'t normally buy that, but..."" Why else would they push a bad business strategy unless they were being encouraged to do so by people who continue to want to keep us separated?\n', '\nThey want you living in the pod, eating ze bugs, and only listening to their “facts”.\n', '\nIt’s also a push to condition people to think that using cash is no longer relevant.\n', '\nIn retrospect that is exactly right.\n', '\nHope she likes never meeting the grandkids\n', '\nThis happened with a case I know.\n', ""\nMy son is never meeting my wife's father. He's a piece of shit. And I think he's a democrat.\n"", ""\nYeah, I was way ahead of my time on the Hunter laptop. I was banned from Facebook for posting content prior to the 2020 election and probably would have received UCMJ action from the Army but had just retired as I pissed off many field grade Officers with that content.

Those together do not add up to the $2 trillion tax break given to corporations and the wealthiest of Americans. We can manage our national debt but it means getting rid of the tax breaks the rich just got, revising Social Security and Medicare and reining in spending.\nInflation is a result of too much money chasing too few goods and services. The pandemic was entirely to blame. Supply was disrupted due to lockdowns and illness due mostly to disruption of the just-in-time (JIT) inventory control system that has become so fashionable. And demand was spurred by the Fed (and other central banks) injecting massive liquidity into the global economy. You can argue that the bankers went overboard, but the alternative was a global depression and they probably decided they'd rather deal with inflationary pressure than a depression the could persist for a decade.\nFuck Russia. Their economy is half the size of California's. They are literally a gas station that sells guns. China is a problem. But one we can deal with. Being a dictatorship, they get to decide what is emphasized in their economy- AI, tech manufacturing, clothing, etc. This is the age of China's industrial revolution. But what they do not do well is innovate. They steal shit and copy it instead. That's because they're communists and that is what you get in a system that discourages free thought and experimentation. The best thing that happened regarding China is they are getting to witness the ass-kicking that Russia is getting in Ukraine. That should give them reason to wonder about the competence of their fighting forces as well as what opposition from the free world might look like if they were to invade Taiwan. Russia has it relative easy. China will have to mount an amphibious landing on an island. That is a fraught proposition.\nI suspect is that what China wants is to nationalize Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, United Microelectronics Corporation and Mediatek. Those are the among the largest and most sophisticated chipmakers in the world. And China has diminished access to those state-of-the-art chips because of those companies relations with the US. TSMC is building a $4 billion plant in Phoenix. And if the administration is smart, it will be incentivizing all of the chip makers in Taiwan to relocate and manufacture in the US- before China commits to invade.\nYour last remark about racial strife relative to Russia and China is like complaining that it's raining. There is not a lot that can be done. People by their nature want to associate and favor people who look like them, act like them, have shared experiences and values. China is a very homogeneous population. But they have shocking instances of racism with one of the few minorities that they do have- the Uyghurs. They round them up and imprison them just for being Uyghur. Russia too is homogeneous. And you never see refugees or immigrants from the Middle East or Africa resettle there. That is because they are unwelcome and everyone, including the government and law enforcement is openly hostile toward them.\n"", ""\nNo conflict required, they've infiltrated the government and they own our banks\n"", ""\nAt the end of the day, physical force will trump all. You're offering an excuse- not a reason.\n"", '\nI meant no conflict required on their end\n', ""\nI disagree. With the military leadership being infested by woke generals and the gradual removal of strong men from the ranks by virtue of the vaccine mandates and other woke policies, I'm not confident US military much less US politicians have the will to turn the key were Russia or China to hit us with nukes.\nTechnologically and at least on paper the USA is unmatched, but when your people are weak and delusional and corrupt, this can only go so far. Exponentially so when God Himself is against you.\nPeople say there's no way this could happen but Putin is being cornered as we speak and Xi Jinping is eager to prove his strength with all of his failures and troubles in China lately. Things are far more dangerous right now than we're being told by those in power.\n"", '\nBased on your comments, I doubt that you ever served in the military. What, precisely do you mean by ""woke generals""? And plenty of strong men (and women) got the vaccine because that was the requirement of the job they took. Taking it or not taking it has nothing to do with strength or ability to serve. Nuclear protocol is well established and the measures are rehearsed and understood by everyone within the chain of command. Russia and China know this and realize if they launch- they get an immediate, retaliatory strike of overwhelming strength that will further degrade their nuclear capability and perhaps their ability respond militarily or even to continue to exist as a country.\nDon\'t assume that members as the armed forces are as craven as you and the people you\'re surrounded by. Xi might be eager, but he just got embarrassed with this whole balloon debacle. And he\'s been watching one of the ""great militaries of the world"" get their candy asses kicked by a country with an army a fraction of their size. Xi is doing the math and no realizes that invading Taiwan would be met with devasting military, political and economic resolve from the West. China thinks in centuries. Not months or years or even decades- but centuries. Xi is going to yap like a little dog, but at the end of the day- I doubt he will even run the risk of giving Russia arms or ammunition.\n', '\nI respect your desire to step in and defend the US military to which you\'re so loyal, but you must understand that the military isn\'t exempt from the rapid cultural decline that the US has been undergoing these last decades, a decline that only seems to be accelerating.\nThere has been a concerted effort by those over the military to remove conservatives and promote feminist, LGBT and anti-white propaganda and policies. The COVID-19 situation made this clearer than ever. Many good men and women were forced out of the service for not taking an experimental drug that has permanent, life-altering negative effects. I\'ve no doubt there are still plenty of good soldiers remaining who will do their duty, but is that enough?\nNuclear war is nothing like conventional war. ICBMs are virtually unstoppable once launched, and Russia alone has the largest stockpile of nuclear warheads in the world. Russia\'s military failures in Ukraine have little-to-nothing to do with their ability to launch a nuclear strike.\nPride comes before the fall. Don\'t make the grievous mistake of thinking the USA is undefeatable.\n\nWhat, precisely do you mean by ""woke generals""?\n\nIf you\'re genuinely curious, start your search with General Mark Milley and go from there.\n', ""\nI asked what your precise definition of that term was for a reason. Why are you refusing to give it to me?\nAnd while you are at it, and since we have now established that you have no firsthand knowledge- why not tell everyone how you've formed your opinion about the state of the US military.

Bro that's a guy it's so easy to tell\n"", '\nI\'m gonna argue differently; only because if you\'re correct, that means the trannies are evolving, and we can\'t have that. I\'ll explain why after each check.\nFace: properly filtered to remove wrinkles and blemishes before posting (tranny men weren\'t raised on narcissism enabling technology and furthermore mistakenly don\'t think they need it. ""I\'m a beautiful woman even with my unkempt beard"" mindset. Only women would have the inclination to spend hours adjusting sliders on a picture that includes her face before uploading it to emphasize something else.)\nJewelry: Limited to two pieces to accentuate and draw attention to how neo wiccan hippie she is (which makes her unique, just like every other neo wiccan hippie woman, which is like 20%+ of the population) -- just a fake ""gemstone"" (quartz for ENERGY) on black cord in the shape of the moon (since her spirit animal is a LONE WOLF), and a woven bracelet, probably hemp because of course it is. (Not nearly garish enough to be a tranny. When they accessorize, they wear as much flashy junk as they can fit, and then some, and have no sense of what looks good and what looks trashy.)\nWardrobe: Coordinated, from what I can tell. Most guys don\'t know how to do that shit. Fags do, they make a living out of telling women how to dress this year, but fags rarely turn trans. (Trans tend to be, as mentioned above, ""throw on everything I liked to wear as a guy, but like, with a skirt, omg I\'m so hot in my cheetos stained teeshirt and mini."")\nEyeglasses: Nuff said, I\'ve never seen a tranny in cats-eye frames, and I used to work for an eye doctor in the faggiest part of California. That\'s exclusively a mid-30s to early-40s woman trying to pretend she\'s sexy but stern (schoolteacher, nurse, receptionist, etc.) look.\nHair: Not nearly garish enough. This is a girl who found out she was going gray, and decided to bleach a strand platinum blonde on each side so that if anyone sees evidence that shows how old she is, she can pretend it\'s just a highlight she did wrong. (Where\'s the purple, green, orange, pink, silver, and blue to show how wacky and non-conformist you are? Not trans.)\nIn conclusion: I don\'t see an apple, although yes, she has man hands. I suspect that\'s not because she\'s a man, but because she\'s getting old. (My grandma\'s hands were very veiny and bulbous too, with those same scabs on her knuckles from thin skin ripping. And she also liked extra long nails, to draw most of the attention away from her hands.)\nIf this IS a tranny, then God have mercy on us all, because they\'re a pair of gloves away from passing for any 35 year old Californian chick working overnights as a nurse because she doesn\'t need a man, but if she does it needs to be a doctor so she can marry and divorce him for his money and raise her kids alone before her eggs shrivel up. I refuse to believe that is the case.

I looked through many other pics on this thing\'s Twitter and there are only a few where I think this thing doesn\'t look like Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin from Superbad) but I guess through this lens I can see why people are immediately defaulting to female. Good point about how tranny guys generally don\'t understand how to coordinate an outfit.\nEdit: I absolutely could still be wrong because the other point I would have argued in your favor is they/them pronouns in bio. Usually men are so desperate to be seen as the women they\'re not that they put she/her pronouns in their bio. They know no one would even know what they\'re going for if they didn\'t outright state it. Idk maybe it\'s just a manly looking/fugly girl--and if it is a girl it is certainly that--but my brain still says ""dude"" when I see that thing.\n', '\nI\'m somewhat amused that we\'re actually having a conversation on gender norms, stereotypes, and all that jazz, explicitly to break down a ""borderline"" tranny and determine empirically whether they have one dangling bit or two sagging bits based on them.\nRegarding the it/they, I\'ve seen dozens of ""confused"" (read: low-value, so either too ugly, fat, androgynous, or old to fit in on any other popular bandwagon) women use those pronouns to stay trendy and current thing. Exclusively in their profile pics on social media, since in real life someone playing along that they don\'t know she\'s a biological female would be a grave insult.\n(I\'ve actually done this before to a lesbian coworker and gotten in trouble for it. She said her pronouns were ""it / they"", and I agreed immediately that she wasn\'t feminine or womanly enough for ""she / her."" Fun meeting with HR later pretending that I wasn\'t body shaming her, I was affirming her identity.)\nIt\'s a typically catty maneuver, having their cake and demanding they don\'t be forced to eat it, too. All the pros of being different from other women, none of the drawbacks of being different from other women. Androgynous women (not the pixie types going for the ""page"" look, which I guess ironically now is the ""Ellen Page"" look -- badumtish -- women who genuinely have masculine features and don\'t try / know how to hide them) tend to be the worst offenders, they still want to be treated like a woman, but ""one of the guys"", but don\'t you dare mistake them for a guy, they\'re just ONE of the guys.\nOn the flipside, I concur, I\'ve never seen a guy (trans or otherwise) want to be mistaken as a genderless eunuch. Even the hairiest, grossest tranny I\'ve ever worked with (smelled like rotten flesh someone took a shit on, then dunked in a barrel of rose perfume, then ripped off their own pubes and artfully glued a few to his upper lip, before finally dressing up in more dayglo orange than a construction site) insisted on she/her.\nMy money is still on ""she was raised a tomboy, is capital d Different from other women of course, but now that she\'s pushing 40 she realizes the other women she looks down on have it better than her, so rather than reflect on her own mistakes or work on improving herself, she doubles down on the whole \'all my best friends are guys, I just don\'t get along with women at all\' omg so quirky mindset that got her here.""\nFurthermore: She has at least three ex-girlfriends she\'ll brag about (but don\'t ask her about her high shag count with guys, kinda sus for a dyke don\'t ya think?), at least one raunchy sex story involving slurping strawberry syrup out the vag she loves to tell her platonic male friends about, and knows damn well that if she makes it to fifty without finding some poor sap who was catfished by her profile pic into a date, she\'s going to take a handful of aspirin as a cry for help, adopt a dozen cats, and start writing feminist literature about how shitty men are, until she gets an honorary doctorate at the local university.\n', ""\n\nadopt a dozen cats\n\nMy best guess, based on what we can tell, is that's already happened.\n"", ""\nI'd add another argument to the women side.

There needs to be a fundamental re-think of ""Punishing Megacorps"" - because it\'s simply not the same thing as punishing a small company.\nThe core is: They\'re always actually considered ""Too Big To Fail"". And that directly leads to the fines being smaller than they might need to be to (A) make the injured party whole, or (B) impact the actual decisionmakers.\nI have a pet Amendment/Bankruptcy Law line of thinking that could be applied in precisely this case - but I did not reword the whole thing specifically for this case. So, here\'s a frame for both how to deal with a company that\'s either bankrupt, and TooBigToFail, or an excessive capital punishment level of criminal.\n\nI propose a new class of bankruptcy for megacorps - also a ""Corporate Death Penalty""\n\nSlice it into five pieces.\nFive Trustees with their primary pay based on \'Futures\' in their slice.\nThe entire executive tier fired, and contracts (Golden Parachutes) all cut. (Which you can do in bankruptcy.)\nAccept as a matter of law that the executive tier ""Is working together"" for consideration of any RICO investigations.\n\n-Now- Decide how to bail the companies out.\n\nWorkers not taking the brunt of it.\nExecs punished.\nSmaller slices mean it isn\'t -just- the behemoths that can rescue one.\n\nToo Big to Fail\nIf one accepts the notion that a fundamental duty of the government is to level the playing field as much as possible, the entire concept of bailing out large, politically connected companies and executives with tax money is quite galling. The key piece in my mind about the phrase “too big to fail” is the start - too big. How can one get large companies to steer less risky paths and generally avoid the failures of corporations that are too big in the first place? And also make it quite certain that not one of the upper echelon is rewarded or personally bailed out?\nThe idea that a monopoly is generally a bad idea is well understood. And the anti-trust legislation exists with the nominal goal of disfavoring and restricting monopolies. But the problems of monopoly pressure extend beyond true monopolies into any market that has a constricted list of competitors. Ten roughly equal corporations are quite a bit more competitive than five, particularly if one or two of the five are dominant. Think Coke and Pepsi.\nHow about a new standard chapter in bankruptcy just for the megacorps? The company is too big, so the first order of business is resizing it. First, the entire executive level can go. They have contracts - but bankruptcy Judges have the power to annul contracts. The executives are the ones steering the ship into the shoals, they don’t need to be rewarded in any fashion. Another set of contracts that merits evaluation is the “golden parachutes” of anyone employed at the executive level in the past five years.\nSecond, slice it into five roughly equal portions. This might be along divisional lines, or product lines, or a brute-force Solomonesque division of everything. Appoint not one Executor for the bankruptcy, but one for each slice, and then let them swap factories, stores or products. Offer the Executors long-term bonds based on the future earnings of their slice to reduce the incentive to collude to the disintrest of their slice.\nNow you’ve removed the people that caused the problem, none of the people requesting help are rewarded financially, and you’ve resized the companies. Only now can one consider adding funds to prop up the individual slices in the short term.\nOne reason a company might really be “too big to fail” is because the company employs a large number of workers. With the company split up, there’s a good chance that a couple of slices will be bought out immediately. When you’re the old AT&T there are a lot fewer companies that can afford a hostile takeover compared to when you get sliced into the Baby Bells. The slices are going to be more nimble, they should be easier to understand and require less executive heft to guide.\nThis new chapter in bankruptcy law might seem quite harsh if sprung on an unsuspecting company that finds itself in this type of situation. Lehman Brothers, AIG, GM, Chrysler - none would have been happy to run into this buzzsaw. But if one gets this chapter of bankruptcy law onto the books, then you’re going to get a contervailing pressure to oppose the “high risk, high rewards” approach of some the most out-of-control companies. All without extensive new regulations, or an entire new layer of oversight. Oversight and regulation have the unending issues of having smart people trying to wiggle out of them while having lobbyists simultaneously intentionally obfuscating every little change in the details of various laws.\nXX In a regular bankruptcy, the Judge can annul contracts. There’s no good reason this isn’t applied to every golden parachute contract from any executive employed at the company within the last five years.\nXX Another key reason a company might be too big to fail is if the company provides some essential product whose disappearance would be enormously destabilizing. That can be economically destabilizing, or it can mean militarily destabilizing\n\nBack to the ""Corporate Death Penalty"" aspect: presume that the corporate officers, board ... the entire executive and legal tier of the company is ""Working Together"" for purposes of firing off RICO-style investigations. You know the company is guilty of XYZ already by this point.

But at least the ""1619 Project"" is a somewhat-original current-day work of propaganda, and can be explained for its ""woke"" bias: the purpose is procuring grant money/donations/""reparations"" and promoting the Leftist Agenda in general.\nHowever, ""1984"" was published almost 75 years ago and has long been considered a warning against allowing current-day authoritarians to ""re-write history"" to suit their current-day authoritarian agendas. Current-day authoritarians ""re-writing history"" is exactly what ""1984"" warns against, therefore the Tolerant Left has targeted the book to be defaced and turned into a mockery of its own warnings to society.\n', '\nJust like the idea of a woman, everything is an idea which must be twisted and perverted,\n', '\nAnd the constant ""re-booting""/""re-imagining"" of movies/TV shows. The Tolerant Left has little ""skill"" at creating new stories and ideas, they are determined to deface previously-written literature and ""entertainment product"" into ""woke"" mockeries of reversed-reality and Leftist Agenda propaganda (along with all traditional aspects of American Culture and Western Civilization in general.)\nAs I mentioned elsewhere, an important point of ""1984"" is to warn of authoritarian zealots ""re-writing history"" to conform with their propaganda. This is exactly why ""1984"" has been targeted for ""re-booting"" as a pro-feminist/gay/anti-white Leftist Agenda ""woke"" propaganda piece, as warning against this sort of authoritarian history-revision is the point of the book to begin with.\n', '\nBecause the left does not create, it consumes and leaves cultural waste behind.\n', '\n“Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.”\nTolkien got that one right on the head.\n', '\nThat is unfortunately true.

That\'s funny to me because the guys were just playing around with ""Find/Replace"" in Microsoft Word (or a similar program) and came up with the idea to turn Jane Austen novels into ridiculous schlock-horror parody with minimal effort.

But it doesn\'t matter, as the results are the same.\nWhile my older siblings became alcoholics, I somehow managed to avoid it other than some truly recreational drinking in my early 20\'s. Had no real taste for it.\nFast forward to about 4 years ago...went thru bad divorce and started drinking a bit too much, which escalated to 3+ years of drinking daily, and being useless.\nI was SO pissed at myself for avoiding that shit for so long, only to have it grab me by the fucking throat later in life. I\'m like WTF?\nThe answer was Clown World, a stolen election, COVID BS and commies. And I\'m being real and honest. It\'s no mystery to me.\nAs for the Pot:\nWhile I never drank - but VERY RARELY by my late 20\'s, I did start smoking weed very heavily. Previously, aside from a few parties that I\'d mildly toke up on, I never bought nor smoked weed at all.\nBut in my late 20\'s, due to some major stressors, I somehow became a major wake-and-bake dude for almost 3 years. Stoned out of my fucking mind, eating ""Munchies"" junk food every day. Never really craved it. But simply chose to imbibe because I simply wanted to escape.\nThen, some major changes came to my life, and I quit weed COLD TURKEY - with like zero side effects. Years later I would gently partake [with some friends] very rarely, maybe 1-2x/year max, and never craved it.\nTo summarize, people are really different about addictions. TONS of variables.\nLike ME, someone can quit pot, and then take up the bottle and vice versa.\nI just hope I can help someone like me. Yes, it\'s a crap shoot, but, at the minimum, why suffer through nasty withdraws, when you can mitigate them at least until you detox from the booze.\nOr use as needed for awhile to tame any of your triggers that might make you run for a beer.\nMost pedes know what will work for them.\nI just threw this out there as a possible option.

All use pretty similar methods of unpacking the false conceptions people have about alcohol that make it hard to quit and continue abstaining. Very different philosophy form AA. The gist of them is to convince yourself that there is zero benefits to alcohol and what people view as benefits to alcohol are in fact illusions and brainwashing. If a person is convinced that there are no benefits then it doesn\'t take willpower to abstain. What makes abstaining hard is that people think they are missing out on something by not drinking. Change that mindset and it becomes easy.\n', '\nAmen brother be strong. Anything is possible with determination. Ask god for strength and he will deliver\n']"

Else, as the saying goes, ""there will be no one left to speak for them.""\nThe missing middle of the essay:\n\nIf one wished to proclaim the equality of all those who bear human features as an ideal, instead of establishing it as a fact, this would be of little help. The abstract utopia would be all too easily reconcilable with the most devious tendencies of society. That all human beings would resemble each other, is exactly what suits this latter. It regards factual or imagined differences as marks of shame, which reveal, that one has not brought things far enough; that something somewhere has been left free of the machine, is not totally determined by the totality. The technics of the concentration camps was designed to turn prisoners into guards, the murdered into murderers. Racial difference was absolutely sublated, so that one could abolish it absolutely, if only in the sense that nothing different survived anymore. An emancipated society however would be no unitary state, but the realization of the generality in the reconciliation of differences. A politics which took this seriously should therefore not propagate even the idea of the abstract equality of human beings. They should rather point to the bad equality of today, the identity of film interests with weapons interests, and think of the better condition as the one in which one could be different without fear.\n\n', '\nGetting their pawns in place.\n', '\n""They"" = 0bama\n', ""\nWorking inside retail store that is likely to fall under the DoD side of this.

NYC charters outperform public schools— and do it at less than half the cost per student.
",/p/16aT3D7n3y/nyc-charters-outperform-public-s/c/,"['\nCharter schools can and do take the cream of the crop when it comes to accepting students. Public schools have to take anyone, no matter their track record. So it’s a bit of an apples and oranges comparison. Charter schools do have another advantage: They are more flexible when it comes to their academic and disciplinary protocols. I believe we need to rethink the entire education system. Stop making it compulsory. Offer it an an opportunity instead of forcing it as a mandate. Make vocational/technical options available to students who don’t seek the classic liberal arts education path. Offer taxpayers vouchers that can be used within a certain regional radius. Develop a “three strikes and you’re out” policy for misbehaviors and poor academic performance. Do these things and watch 90% of the problems melt away.\n', ""\nGet government out of education.

With these high salaries and crazy benefits (paid summers off, etc), you’d think that they would be 100% focused on the betterment of their students, and there’d be something to show for it. But nah, the parents don’t give a fuck, the teachers don’t give a fuck, and the kids act like animals all day and learn nothing.\n', '\nDamn as a nyc teacher, they must have hid all those perks from me...could you point me to all these amazing benefits you are talking about?\nI just hit 5 years in, making 75k in NYC.

Are you gonna send the kids to prison after they assault the teacher or threaten to jump them after-school for asking them to sit down and take some notes?\nPoint is the job sucks ass, and if it was as great as you made it to be the department would not need to be cutting teaching requirements and grabbing people from other countries to teach kids in America. Why is their always a shortage around this country for teachers? The benefits you claim that exist should have people rushing to teach Tyrone and little Jimmy.

That's impossible on the moon and that's can never send live video. But this technology can give footage that's of relatively high quality, like old films.\nThe second option is cathode ray tube cameras. Those were only in use by news stations, and even for them, the video results are terrible. If you look up cathode ray tube cameras of old TV stations, they were huge. Not something you can bring to the moon. The way these devices worked, it's extremely suspicious that such a good footage came from such a small cathode ray tube camera.\nAnd finally there's the transmission problem. Digital processing was still young and undeveloped. The video had to be encoded in analog from the moon because computers at the time were very slow and incapable of processing real time video.\nNow when a video is encoded in an analog way and then transmitted all the way from the moon, you'd expect extreme levels of noise. There's none. It's too clear.\nIt's just extremely implausible that they had technology to live stream from the moon footage of this quality. The initial footage from the very shitty camera is somewhat possible, but the rest of the videos just seem impossible with the technology of that time.\nOr maybe they had breakthrough in cathode ray tube cameras, in noiseless analog video transmission and communication, that was way ahead of it's time and used only for the moon.\nI think it might even be relatively simple to just check if the cathode ray tube cameras that supposedly filmed on the moon can even produce these outputs.\nBy the way, I think it's quite probable that they reached and filmed the moon in an unmanned mission, getting the data they needed to fake the rest.\n"", '\nLol moon camera\n', '\nYour IQ is too high for this site.\n', '\nI thought math was racist?\n', '\nAnd we haven’t been back regularly why?\n', '\nPeople chose George Floyd over George Jetson.\n', '\nJudy is my cartoon dream fuck\n', '\nSuch a wanton, future blonde\n', '\nPlatinum.

Thats a gross gain of 1,333 gallons of energy.\nHowever, the mining, transportation, refining and production costs of the batteries must be taken into account.\nA typical dumper uses 25k gallons of diesel a year. That’s 70 a day. A typical ev lithium battery takes 500,000 pounds of earth, or roughly 25 loads. Assuming a distance of a couple miles between quarry site and refining facility and a travel speed of 5mph, that’s roughly an entire days 10 hours shift. Which is 70 gallons of diesel.\nA loader on the other hand burns 12 gallons per hour. Let’s assume 2 hours of run time to fill 25 dumps. That’s 24 gallons.\nAlready we are at 94 gallons of diesel just to move the lithium ore.\nNow, I don’t have the time to go into the specifics of smelting and refining, but imagine 25 kilograms of lithium. It takes 35 kg of coke just to cremate a human body. You’re looking at 1 gallon of gas worth of energy per kg, probably much higher.\nSo already we are at 120 gallons just for the smelting and transportation. Now some may argue specifics or what not, but I certainly wouldn’t call this amount “negligible”. Further- what if the car gets 35-40mpg? Then it’s all out the window!

Millions of people are being poisoned around ohio right now and they’re acting like nothing is the matter.\nWe just went through two years of lockdowns and unconstitutional closures of businesses. Lives were decimated and the perpetrators have paid no price.\nAnd all of it was justified because the government and “private” industry take turns doing each others dirty work in ways that allow for no recourse. Businesses enforced policies based on CDC guidelines but the CDC has no authority. The federal government acted in accordance with WHO guidelines and the WHO is a fucking foreign body with no authority. So who do you sue for infringing your rights? A bank closes down your account because you attended a sUpEr SpReAdEr event and you get told they’re a private business and that’s their choice. But they’re following the direction the federal government’s unconstitutional orders that are based on the “recommendations” of a foreign organization that has no authority here.\nMake it make sense to me. Make me believe these elections mean anything when both sides gerrymander constantly to keep elections as close to 50/50 as possible. When illegals can vote. When all that’s required to cast a vote is for someone to return a paper ballot that was mailed out to someone else and won’t even be verified with a signature. When politicians staunchly oppose X but then the second they have a chance to repeal X they suddenly change their mind. When 900 page bills worth trillions of dollars in spending get approved despite not one single person knowing what’s in them.\nIt’s all a joke. There’s no political solution to this problem and they know that. They don’t lose a goddamn wink of sleep over the thought of what the voters might do at the ballot box\n', '\nSure,\nuntil we can get an honest, unbiased MSM, or punch so many holes into their hull, figuratively speaking, we are dead in the water. Suport for alternative media is of utmost importance.\nOnce we get significant media support elections will start to be cleaned up, but not before, especially in more blue states.\n\u2007\nHave you heard many stories about Dominion Voting Systems and their software failures in the MSM?\nNo, because a lot of politicians are dependent on the public believing that the elections are honest and above board.\nOnce honest people get back into power, all laws should be reviewed and many struck down, as many of the politicians who voted for these bills are bought and paid for.\n\u2007\n', '\nYah I just don’t trust the system to correct itself. There are people in the federal government who have worked there for 50 years. They’ve applied nepotism to everything they’ve touched for half a century. Voting them out would be like arresting the kingpin of a drug cartel and expecting all the underlings to just pack up and go home.\nThough I gotta admit that the emphasis they put on elections, registering, campaigning, and voting machines makes it seem like the elections possibly do matter to some non-zero degree.\nUnless… the whole point of campaigns is\n\n\nto create a show that pacified people with faith in the legitimacy of the system\n\n\nto raise and launder a shitload of money, most of which will go to the candidate, their closest friends/family, and the wages of their campaign workers (who are usually their most loyal supporters)\n\n\nTo have an excuse for where all the votes went. If you have to give people a ballot you also have to take it back. It has to go somewhere. You can’t just throw all the ballots in a river. Someone has to be in charge of burying the evidence.

In a 2010 study published in the British Journal of Nutrition, one group ate three meals a day while another ate six. (Total daily calorie counts were identical.) Researchers found no weight or hormonal differences between the groups. In 2014, University of Warwick researchers found no difference in metabolism between a group of women that ate two meals a day and another group that ate five.\n\nIf meal schedule doesn\'t matter one way or another, how can you call one racist vs. another? At best, you can say there are racial differences in observed meal schedules between Europeans and Africans. Doesn\'t make either practice inherently racist.\nBut of course, we\'re arguing with libs here, and everything is racist to them.\nAlso, this part seems like blatant misinformation if you ask me:\n\nThe one thing that might actually improve your metabolism is periodic fasting—that’s right, the very same eating pattern that the early European settlers deemed uncivilized.\n\nThe colonization of Africa happened in a time period where European adherence to Christianity was still extremely high, and traditional Christianity DOES observe regular periods of fasting (usually at least once a week, plus 4 weeks of lent). To say that the settlers thought fasting was uncivilized behavior seems rather unbelievable, if not completely made up.\nAs far as the rest of the headline goes, I don\'t even disagree with her, but the racism charge is ridiculous and appears to have been invented out of whole cloth. My guess is, the author was forced by her parents, who identified as Christians (but were probably too ""modern"" to observe fasting) to eat 3 meals a day even when she didn\'t feel like it, and wasn\'t allowed to have any food outside of that. But rather than hold her parents to account for their failures, she blames her entire race.\nTL;DR: white liberals are the most racist people on earth, more news at 11.\n', '\nNice analysis, thanks\n', '\nTheir conclusions are still crap because you can\'t ""not notice weight gain"" if you have one group consuming more mass than the other. I guarantee this is another one of those ""self-reporting"" studies whereby the participants merely state the number of meals they ate and the total amount of calories consumed.\nI don\'t even know where the claim of ""periodic fasting was deemed uncivilized by Euros"" even comes from. Of course, given that it\'s from Mother Jones, it likely was just a claim pulled out of the author\'s ass because they know that their readers will buy anything they sell.\n', ""\nI didn't spend any time looking into the studies she cited or their methodologies, but it seems clear that the part about fasting being considered uncivilized is clearly the weakest part of her argument, and not backed up with any evidence whatsoever. Seems pretty clear she just pulled that out of her ass and/or is projecting her childhood grievances onto the colonizers.\n"", ""\nYou don't really need to look into the studies to understand that the basic premise is bullshit. All living things are only able to increase in size by consuming matter from external sources, and since no living thing is so efficient that it only utilizes exactly the amount it needs from what it consumes and excretes all that it does not, excess will build up.\nIf you eat more and change nothing else about your lifestyle, you will gain weight, period. Conversely, if you run a caloric deficit (either by reducing intake or increasing utilization), you will lose weight.\n"", ""\nI'm not sure where you got that or why you are so laser-focused on that particular part.

Somebody would have risen to do the necessary work.

While an insight, Special Relativity was a leap from late 19th century knowledge of gravity and electromagnetism, but not an insurmountable one.

Also it’s not just about invention.. there are also stories about the social justice movement that have just plain been skewed before because they were told by white authors.

What Biden Appears to Have Shot Down Over Lake Huron Is Clown-Show Stuff

That is the same day a Lockheed Martin F-22 shot down an unidentified object of a similar description and altitude in the same general area.\n\nMy favorite part:\n\n“I tried contacting our military and the FBI—and just got the runaround—to try to enlighten them on what a lot of these things probably are.

Medlin says one of his balloons—call sign W5KUB-112—is projected by HYSPLIT to enter U.S. airspace on Feb. 17.

Again, and for the same reason, the statue remained in its alcove towards the top of the church.\n\nFast-forward a few decades, and news circulates that the long--closed Catholic elementary school (adjacent to the old church and on the same lot) is now going to be a ""[Name of CITY] Charter School."" (That\'s how they\'re getting city kids into the suburbs--by building/acquiring schools there.)\n\nSoon after, resident snoops found out that a Muslim group headquartered in a nearby city had purchased the vacant school AND the chuch. And voila! The BVM suddenly disappeared ftom her roost in the alcove.\n\nThat, of course, is in violation of the deed restriction. Curiously, though, no one in authority wants to talk about it. Moreover, the deed (noting the restriction) recording, which is a public record, has 🤔 disappeared from the county\'s database and, apparently, from its libers. Imagine that!\n\nThe cherry on the banana split of this Buffalo mosque, will no doubt be the same as ALL of these acquisitions by Muslims: the churches\' melodious Sunday bells were long-silenced, but be prepared to hear the otherworldly cacophony of the Muslim call to prayer. Wake up, sheeple.\n', '\nI think there was an Episcopagan Church in Buffalo or elsewhere in upstate NY.\nThe locals wanted to stay more conservative and seceede from the National Org.\nThe National Org refused to sell to the parishoners, even at a price well above the market rate for similar properties.\nAfter the parishoners gave up, the National DC-area based HQ sold it at cost... to an Islamic Org. Just to be pricks.\nThis is the same Church that had the Gay Bishop who divorced his wife, and had the Female Archbishop/Primate that made blasephemous remarks about humans being on par with the Divinity.\n', '\nHow the fuck did they pay less for this than I paid for my fucking 3 bedroom house?\n', ""\nNot if I'm there it won't.\n"", ""\nCan't build your own so move on in like bugs\n""]"

You kill animals, sometimes for your nourishment, sometimes because they\'ve hurt people. Decide for yourself, does the ""liberal"" consider themself to be an animal or in God\'s image?\nI don\'t believe I\'m saying to murder anyone, or to be against the commandment.\nI do think such a thing would have to come from God, though. God sent Ehud. Look up that name.\nSee, for me, it\'s not that these. . . whatever they are. . .are so completely detached now from America, themselves, and reality, that makes them a true danger. I could live with any of them so long as they behaved within an American ethos, but I truly think any endgame they have must include, literally, killing us off. They would do this in tribute to Satan, thinking they are doing right, in fact. . . not knowing what they do, in fact. I don\'t even think they could exist in such a vacuum of their own ideology, but would destroy themselves fairly quickly. But so long as Satan remains undefeated by God, they can put that creature in the place of God. So, what it means is they won\'t stop.\nThey\'ve turned. It\'s like we\'re facing down a drugged out psycho, where more and more are joining the drugged out psycho, where we all agree that\'s the situation and we all know it can\'t turn out well without our engagement, but at the same time we don\'t know how to engage or really even what to do. This is the case, except one thing, the drug is no earthly drug, but the Blood of the Saints.\nWhat do you think Madonna is trying to do? She thinks she\'s the Whore of Babylon. She\'s trying to be that image. I\'m telling you, these people are crazy. Nevertheless, she\'s not ineffective, because she beguiles others to be like her, and so she is a sign.\nIf this is what they do in the green leaf, what will they do in the dry? Jesus said that during his crucifixion. So, that\'s another thing to think about. People seem to think a war or Depression would calm things down, that it would cause people to snap out of it, but they\'re wrong. It would get a lot lot worse.\nWe may already be in the end times, and there\'s nothing to do but wait. Even on here (PW), we\'ve missed something big. How much of the world has been given a poison vaccine? A third? Seems like it could be the wrath of God being poured out on mankind, not the Mark of the Beast that some jackasses on here bray about.\nPeople want to copout and say people have always said it was the end, but this time there\'s something new that is actually from old that people are missing - internet connectivity, is simply relative proximity. Revelation speaks of the people of the world seeing and experiencing all these terrible things happening but not repenting. Why? Because even though they see they don\'t understand. Being able to see what\'s going on across the world in a second is significant. The world used to be similarly small like this a long long time ago.

The Corps loves to tell the people generating credits that the streams they enhanced are ephemeral, and loves telling the guys that need to buy credits that the streams they are impacting are intermittent.\nA lot of it has to do with state agencies too. States adopting SQT has wreaked havoc on development as well, and greatly increased costs.\nI'm against almost every form of regulation, but water is an exception. As a water engineer, it is very apparent that what you do to water on your own land does not have effects that stay on your land, so to some degree I am comfortable with regulating water. But the regulations need to be sensible and improve the lives of citizens, not be so burdensome that they hurt people, which is what we are doing now.\n"", '\nAsk a developer/contractor about SWPPP permits…the BIGGEST waste of fuckin money ever. I’m all for keeping clean job sites. But the idea that I need massive berm systems or barriers to keep mud in the job site is retarded. Especially when the basis is because that water eventually makes it into “navigable” waters. Meanwhile, all the farmers who spray all sorts of shit on their land are exempt from this. The people who are the entire reason they want a law like this are exempt. Only construction sites are chemical polluters according to the EPA I guess…\n', ""\nI do SWPPP permits. They can be excessive and the regulations are inflexible. Forcing developers to build a sediment basin at a specific drainage area acreage is insane, it should be looked at case by case.\nBut I've also seen enough contractors get NOVs for not putting up silt fence, then a big rain comes and 50 tons of sediment gets dumped into a stream and ends up on someone else's property, that I do actually think SWPPP permits aren't a bad thing. Maybe not perfect, but better than nothing.\nI know they feel punitive, but it really should be against the law to let developers do hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to someone else's property by avoiding the cost of a berm or some silt fence.\nIt's kind of the same thing as if I bought the house next to you and then started cooking meth. You do not want that shit next to your house. It should not be legal for me to put you at high risk of suffering physical damage to your property via a meth lab explosion, or economic damage via the housing market discovering the house next door is/was a meth lab. Kind of the same deal. If a developer doesn't put up stormwater controls, it isn't a matter if, it's a matter of when, and there will be an illicit discharge that will damage someone else's shit. 100% of the time. Because it is going to rain.\nThe problem here is how it feels vs reality. When you want to build on your land, it feels wrong that the government tells you how, when, and if you can when it comes to stormwater. But the reality is, that stream flowing through your property may be on your property, but it is a natural transportation lane that can move hundreds of tons of dirt, pollutants, ect. If a property upstream likes to fish their stream, and you dump even a little sediment, you could cut off their supply of fish. Or back water up and flood their land.\nEven a little sediment can dramatically impact downstream water quality and even result in aggradation or erosion on someone else's property, even effect their groundwater recharge or increase flooding.\nI'm a middle man between the contractor and regulators. I understand the regulations and the need for them, but I'm not fond of the personality types that end up as regulators, and I genuinely feel bad for the contractors because it is very inflexible and often very opaque as to why they have to spend thousands to do this stuff just to stop a little dirt.\n"", ""\nEeeesh... I'm a land owner about to enlarge a sometimes pond area and fortify a small damn to hopefully give me a nice but small fishing spot (3/4 acres). The pond is fed by a sometimes stream that only flows during and after rain. The sometimes stream flows onto and then off my property into a drainage ditch.\nDo I need to be worried about this stuff?\n"", '\nIf the stream truly only flows in direct response to rainfall, it is ephemeral. Unfortunately, and I strongly strongly disagree with this, ephemeral streams are jurisdictional WOTUS. I\'m not even sure all intermittent streams should be WOTUS, but some probably should be.\nImpounding a jurisdictional stream is considered a ""discharge"" of ""fill,"" and requires compensatory mitigation. Meaning you spend a fuckwad of money buying ""credits"" from a company that hired me to design streams for them, which that company then built and went through an arduous regulatory process.\nI won\'t tell you you can do it or that your should do it. I\'m not a lawyer, I\'m an engineer. But I will say that I have never heard of USACE coming after someone for doing something on their own private land, unless that person was involved in some other (usually commercial) endeavor which brought government attention to the land in question within a few years of the impact to the stream taking place.\nIf it were me, I\'d fucking go for it. Honestly im jealous, id love to have a tiny bit of land somewhere with a tiny stream and some fish, where i could teach my daughters to shoot and go camping. Id do the same as you.\nJust be aware, if that stream flows more than you say it flows, and there is a property downstream of it that makes use of that channel in some way, you could be negatively impacting someone else\'s property. Daming up a stream can also mess with hydrographs and increase peak flows if not done right with a properly designed method of discharge.\n', ""\nThanks for the info, Pede. I'll share my small, soon-to-be fishing hole with you and your family any day.\n"", '\nNo problem. I\'m really on the design side of things, I actually design streams (the ones that generate credits people have to buy to ""mitigate"" for impacting existing streams) for all this, while the ecology guys do the permitting and understand the legal/regulatory stuff better, but I work closely with them and spent some time on the regulatory side back before I did design.\nIt\'s actually a very cool job.\n', '\nI get much of the sentiment behind this, but the fact remains if you do what you are describing, the person who had their land damaged by your actions already has a cause of action to sue you for the damage. This is merely redundant and highly punitive. Now the feds can shut down your job site for non compliance even if there is no real substantive way that dirt is going to escape the job site. It’s just like process crimes…can’t just be charged with bank robbery, but must add interstate wire fraud, interstate flight to avoid arrest, and use of a weapon to commit a felony…that’s the level of redundancy here.\nTwo years ago, I had a project going in an area with probably 50 others. I was the ONLY guy who was attempting to comply with the SWPPP permit. I had berms and barriers. But one corner of my barrier was not fully functional. We had a rain, and some mud escaped out of the back about 1-2 feet out, and 2-3 feet wide. They came out and raised holy hell about 2-3 spades worth of mud and demanded I fix it. Well, this is one long run. The only way to fix it perfectly was to redo the entire run for $1200. I’ll be damned if I am gonna pay that. They suspended my permit until I did 🤬\nKeep in mind, I am the only guy in substantial compliance. The rest have zero berms/barriers/etc and yet I am the one singled out for arbitrary enforcement. I brought this to their attention and they literally gave zero fucks. This is like every other city/county/state inspector I have dealt with. They want to have a pissing match with contractors and then flex nuts with the power to shut down your job over meaningless shit.\nWe ought to just stick with common law and statutory nuisance/trespass causes of action here. I guarantee that for every one instance of proper prevention, there are 3 or more instances of flagrant contractor abuse and a substantial waste of money. Especially when the main offenders are farmers and they are exempt from complying. It’s just more federal overreach with questionable constitutional basis, and a one size fits all process that doesn’t solve the problem but it does provide another avenue for government to abuse the citizen. Enough is enough.\n', '\nYeah, you’re biased. Unless you’re talking about actual chemical wastes, the ground itself is a filter.\n', '\nBiased? If my stream design jobs dried up, I could do mine water handling, landfill runoff, flood studies, SWPPPs, about 592635 types of environmental permitting, ect.\nI dont actually do anything with wells or groundwater, other than having to be able to read a report and understand it. I have written some groundwater reports for permits too. A total of 0% of my income has ever come from anything to do with aquifers. Even if some of my income did come from that, I am a consultant, the fuck to I care about warping the truth about groundwater filtration? It would not serve me to lie about that in any way. My job is basically to mediate between regulators and clients, I tell regulators to back off my clients and push to relax regulations, and I tell clients that no, they can\'t burn 17 tons of styrofoam next to a daycare to get rid of it. If my clients don\'t like what I say, sucks for them. I\'m drowning in 500 types of work, and none of them are financially invested in aquifers, even if I am required to understand aquifers.\nSandstone and dirt does not filter salt out of water. Not mercury. Not iron. Not calcium. Not quickly. It filters e-coli and human shit, which is why drip field sewage systems are a thing.\nYou can literally used colored dye injected at a recharge site to map aquifers. Is one of the things we do.

What is the current model for how ground water is replunished? Also, any studies out there to show that fresh water wells within a 100 miles of the coast are filled by naturally filtered sea water?\n', '\nGroundwater is incredibly complex. I have worked tangentially with that subject but I am not an expert.\nAquifers are usually replenished by rainfall at groundwater recharge sites. These sites can spread over hundreds of acres if the aquifer is not cut off from the topsoil by an impermeable layer. Other aquifers, particularly deeper ones, may have more isolated recharge sites where the well is connected to the surface via a permeable layer only in a few small locations. Aquifers can also be interconnected and some may recharge from others. A lot of drilling and testing is required to map and understand an aquifer.\nI would imagine that wells exist in coastal regions which recharge from the oceans, naturally filtering the water to some degree, but i would also think those aquifers would not be ""fresh water."" Permeable rock can filter some things, such as organic compounds fairly well, but dissolved minerals are harder to filter.\nIn fact, this article seems to think there is concern over saltwater intrusion into aquifers. It probably is something to be concerned about in that your reliance on groundwater for freshwater shouldn\'t be 100% in coastal regions, but nature.com means they are going to somehow make it about climate change or some bullshit.\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17038-2\n', ""\nI just watched this video about PFAS and I'm wondering about my drinking water.\nI have a Berkey but haven't set it up yet.

As with any pollutant in drinking water, you can do kind of one of three things in these categories:\n\npush water through a screen with holes that are too small for the pollutant to get through\nuse a chemical medium that can bind with the pollutant and then be removed, with the pollutant attached, from the water\nuse a chemical which neutralizes the pollutant in some way which renders it safe for consumption\n\nI dont know much about PFAS, how to remove it, or your filter. But I drink city water, from an activated carbon filter in my fridge, which I often forget to change. Maybe I'll grow a tumor. Maybe not. I don't worry about it too much, there is too much scary shit to worry about already.\nBut it probably wouldn't hurt to do some digging and figure out how to keep your drinking water clean.\n"", ""\nThank you for the response.\nI'm setting up my Berkey today!\n"", '\nI’m not sure what the question is. Are you talking about salt water intrusion into fresh water wells near the coast? Fresh and salt water form a wedge shape near the coast. If you draw water from the wedge the salt water will advance but from deeper first and gradual move upwards as the wedge advances. Many place like in SoCal actually implement salt water barrier projects that actually inject fresh, often times recycled, water near the coast to push the salt water wedge out. 100 miles is way too far for salt water intrusion but in some places that have very bad salt water intrusion can see once fresh water wells pump chloride heavy wells many miles inland and the deeper the well the sooner it will be impacted.\n', ""\nWhat does this rule mean and why is it being blocked. I just don't understand which is why I'm asking\n"", '\n""By contrast, the agencies conclude that the 2020 NWPR, which substantially departed from prior rules defining “waters of the United States,” is incompatible with the objective of the Clean Water Act and inconsistent with the text of relevant provisions of the statute, the statute as a whole, relevant case law, and the best available science. The 2020 NWPR found jurisdiction primarily under the relatively permanent standard. The agencies have concluded that while the relatively permanent standard is administratively useful by more readily identifying a subset of waters that will virtually always significantly affect paragraph (a)(1) waters, it is insufficient as the sole test for Clean Water Act jurisdiction. Sole reliance on the relatively permanent standard\'s extremely limited approach has no grounding in the Clean Water Act\'s text, structure, or history. Limiting determinations to that standard alone upends an understanding of the Clean Water Act\'s coverage that has prevailed for nearly half a century. The relatively permanent standard as the exclusive jurisdictional test would seriously compromise the Clean Water Act\'s comprehensive scheme by denying any protection to tributaries that are not relatively permanent and adjacent wetlands that do not have a continuous surface connection to other jurisdictional waters""\nThat paragraph from the executive summary I think sums it up.\nBasically, under Obama, WOTUS was subjectively defined and included ephemeral streams (basically tiny ""streams"" that do not have water in them unless it is raining.) I\'ve seen USACE take jurisdiction of 0.5\' bankfull width roadside ditches on dirt roads and call them jurisdictional.\nTrump put out an EO and said stop that shit, re-write the definition of WOTUS to be less subjective and stop taking jurisdiction of stuff that is barely even a stream. So EPA did, they re-wrote the rule. It was awesome, and in effect for like a year or two, maybe 3.\nThen some leftist judges vacated it, so the agencies defaulted back to Obamas version. Then Biden usurps power, and the globalists pulling the strings want to ramp up the boot on the neck of our economy, so they want to codify the old Obama rule (which is already de-facto in place) as the formal and current rule. So they justify taking jurisdiction over a stream of piss from a wayward deer because climate and save the planet and shit.\nNow Republicans, who only do shit when they don\'t have the power to get shit done so we keep voting for these clowns thinking they are on our side, only to do nothing when they do get power, are suing to stop the new rule, which would... do nothing, and we would default to the Obama version which we are already defaulted to and which Bidens version is basically the same as.\nBut, I really haven\'t read into the nuts and bolts of it, it\'s very long and I\'m sure the Biden version is even worse and adds some hidden gotchas.\n', '\nSCOTUS ignores it too.\n', '\nThe real solution is throw out federal jurisdiction over all resources and leave it to the states\n', ""\nDemocrats don't care about precedence.

All he had to do is look into the Eliza Blue censorship story. Instead he went full Jack Murphy and Frosk Urine telling his subscribers to leave.\n', ""\ni'm not that old and none of this makes sense.\ni'm assuming this is some sort of streamer drama? seems like a good use of mental bandwidth.\n"", '\nNo its not streamer drama.\n\n\nTim platformed a woman grifting off sex trafficking survivors, making hundreds of thousands off his audience in the process only to be a fake who was never trafficked nor can prove her claims of helping anyone. On top of that, his journalist wrote a puff piece simping for her. Timcast chose to ignore all this and went silent, and even went further blaming his followers for calling out the BS.\n\n\nThere is a censorship issue this has created. Eliza in the process has gathered many powerful simps, one of which was Elon during her rise to fame. She used this clout to initially ban streamers for reporting on this grift and lies that were being revealed. Tim chose to ignore this as well, while still touting himself the free speech advocate.\n\n\nBasically Tim does not want to admit he promoted another Jack Murphy, this one being worse with the censorship aspect involved. All the meanwhile, ignoring the incorrect ""journalisming"" his company did when new information was revealed about Eliza, as well as being a free speech hypocrite on the censorship that occurred.\n', ""\nAt this point you have to start asking questions about why Pool keeps so much of his life out of public view. He clearly associates with some total weirdos and makes no comment on them. Methinks he may be hiding some weirdo characteristics about himself too? I'd imagine he is a prime metoo target.\n"", ""\nHis insecurity is on full display each time he wears that stupid beanie. No one really cares about the state of his hair. (No rhyme intended)\nHe comes across as someone that always had to compete against siblings to be right and has the Hannity interruptus disease.\nIf you're a former leftist you're going to have some weirdo friends.\n"", '\n\nthe Hannity interruptus disease\n\nAlways makes me laugh when he puts out clips of his IRL with titles like ""Ann Coulter EXPOSES Ghost Districts, Illegal Immigrants Used To Win Elections"" and ""Jimmy Dore SLAMS Media Lies Over Ukraine, Says CIA Coup Helped Ignite War"" when it\'s literally just Tim Pool monologuing about it with the guest nodding along in polite agreement.\n', ""\nIt's almost like he understand's youtubes base and what the algo's direct towards people and the user's tend to click. Analytics, it's kind of important when running a business nowdays.\n"", ""\nThis is pretty true.

Everyone is awkward in one way or another, and the persona on screen is an act almost all the time with everyone, whether they're just changing their voice or going full personality makeover. Not many celebs or on screen personalities can show their true selves without taking a hit to their public image.\nI don't know if any of his crew are more awkward than anyone else in the world, except maybe Ian. They just seem less concerned with maintaining a persona so the awkwardness shows more often. Tim seems to largely use his persona to keep the conversation on the rails and give it some semblance of moderation, although it does occasionally go to his head.\n"", '\nHe’s strikes me as a guy who likes to message 14 year olds online.\n', '\nBecause he’s backed by nefarious people like every other random nobody that rises to popularity.

To act like doing this somehow makes people instantly rich and famous is just retarded.\n', '\nI would have said promoted but his point still stands.\n', ""\nI don't think platformed is the best choice, and he definitely didn't promote her in any way. He just had her on as a guest a couple times, and in a neutral way. Worth noting her last visit was before any of this drama happened or her trafficking story was called into question. His way of handling it wasn't the best (initially he said he didn't want to talk about her because she was an irrelevant nobody and didn't want to promote or give any more attention to her, which is the opposite of promotion) but then kind of lost it so I can understand the anger at that part anyway. But I don't think it was as big a blunder as so many are making it out to be.\nBasically: Pool has rando claiming to be trafficking victim on his show a few times. After this, her story is exposed and she's called out by others. Tim's later shows (having nothing to do with her) are brigaded (largely by viewers of that dude that shills really shitty coffee, forget his/his shows name. He's otherwise ok from the few bits I've seen) in the chat section where nobody will stfu about why he isn't talking about egirl drama, accusing him of censorship. He addresses this at the end by basically saying she's irrelevant and didn't want to bring any more attention to a nobody following the 'trafficking hoax' allegations (fair). Then he makes the mistake of saying all the comments were from bots (but again, most were from the coffee merchant's brigade, so, the sentiment isn't completely off and he was probably pissed off enough at this point after seeing all the comments for 2 hours worth of show that had nothing to do with her and covered newsworthy stories, and the relevant comments in the chat couldn't get through)\nThe however many part story was horrible trash, but that was 100% on Cashman (one of Pool's journalists). He told Cashman he thought it wasn't a good idea but wouldn't stop him from doing it, either. I believe it was removed quickly from his site in its entirety anyway (or at least one of the articles was fully removed, I didn't really read them honestly).\n"", ""\nIt would've been faster to just suggest a better word to use.\n"", ""\nI'd rather undercover leftists that just want to troll and divide this sub just give themselves away with the words they use.\n"", '\nTell me you know nothing about multimedia marketing and business in one reply lol.\n', '\nYour bullshit terms you learned in leftist universities mean nothing to me.\n', '\nI’ve never met someone so proud of not knowing definitions of words lol.\n', '\nYou must be a special type of retard.

Midway between Paris and the North Pole, it is where automakers come to see if their newest creations can endure the most frozen of tortures.\nSo it seemed the perfect place for The Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association to bring a handful of electric cars, to see how they manage in conditions unimaginable in the more temperate latitudes where automotive designers work in Germany and California.\nAfter all, drivers in far northern climates are as likely to encounter 30 below as 30 above. Cellphones regularly fail in extreme cold. Can an electric car fare much better?\nHmm, can it? Spoiler alert: No it cannot.\nIn Finland, Ståle Frydenlund, test manager for theelectric vehicle association, locked five new models into the proving ground\'s cold chambers overnight and set the thermometer for -40 degrees. When he returned the next morning, the results were not particularly reassuring. Three of the vehicles – Kia Niro EV, Nissan Ariya and MG4 Electric – could not drive out of the chamber on their own power.\n""We had to put the gear levers in neutral and push the cars out,"" said Mr. Frydenlund.\nThat\'s right: Get yourself an electric car in Norway and there\'s a healthy chance you\'ll be going around by foot-power in the colder months.\n', '\nTime to buy stock in reindeer farms!

They get most of their power from hydroelectric - but they're pretty much maxed out making new plants, and a dry year with lowered reservoir levels at the dams makes them buy power from outside, or gasp burn natural gas.\nOh, but they're building wind farms.\nSure.\nAlso note that the power grid in Norway is owned by the state. So when they need to jack up prices for the pressure all those new EVs cause...nothing they can do, no competition exists.\nAnd, when they start rationing power...\nEdit: see my other post. They might actually be in a position to do it. But the point of the power being in the hands of the state is still problematic.\nInteresting that Norway also exports enough oil and natural gas, that it's 20% of their GDP, but they sock the profits into government accounts that are from what I can see to pay for the elderly, it's their form of social security, I guess?\n"", '\nI know for a fact that Norway has already rationed power.\n', ""\nNonsense, this is also easily researched, Norway gets 5% of it's power from Sweden.

I don\'t hate EVs and even see a place for them. I could easily see a ""commuter"" EV as a secondary vehicle for short trips. A small affordable EV for local trips would be perfect. I would love something cheap I could pay off quickly and drive for 10+ years would help out a lot of people save money.\nBut the mandates screw everything up. Instead of a competitive EV (small, cheap, low cost of ownership, practical) it incentives these EV land yachts that cost $70k on up. I now could be forced to take out a 10 year loan on a vehicle I never wanted to buy in the first place that offers me less utility than what I currently own. And of yea, the battery takes a shit in 7 years so I would quickly be upside down on any loan AND have to fork over thousands to replace a battery pack.\nIt only profits GM, Ford, etc by letting them eliminate the entire powertrain (engine, trans, radiator, etc) while charging you MORE than they would for a gas vehicle.

They will be rounded up, assigned a flat and forced to live in the city where they can be under proper surveillance 24/7 since the government sees tribes of rural people as a threat.

That also assumes you can even manufacture enough lithium battery packs. It would cost many trillions of dollars.

I am constantly amazed how you can't say, add a cooktop to a school or some lighting to a highway facility without facing problems with wire sizes, telephone pole guy wires, pole transformers, pad transformers etc. There is no spare capacity and it has been cobbled together slowly since Edison started it all.\n"", ""\n\nThere is no way everyone can charge their car at the same time (like after work) because it is impossible without new house electrical services\n\nSo they don't, you get a smart system that does 1.5 hours of charging between 5pm and 7am depending on what the power company determines.\n"", ""\nThat wouldn't give you much of an allowance for driving -- maybe that will be the plan.

Charging isnt linear, it is logarithmic. 3 hours from 0-80, 3 hours from 80 to 100\nIt isnt some allowance based system either, it is just the charger activating when power prices go down. people drive for 10% off their gas bill, they will opt into something like this for half off the electric usage. Hell, utility companies often offer a plan where you pay ~20% more during regular hours and get free electricity between 9pm and 6 AM\n', '\nAround here in the winter, ( it is about zero F today), you would need to charge it daily for a typical commute.\nFrom a random Google search on the Nissan LEAF ""From a daily range capability of around 65 miles at 86 Fahrenheit, range drops as low as 36-37 miles at extreme lows of -13 F--temperatures recently experienced in Canada and some of the U.S. north east. Beyond temperatures in the mid-80s, range begins to fall again."" - https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1082048_nissan-leaf-range-how-much-does-it-lose-in-the-cold\nTypically you need the front window heat on as well as electric rear defrost continuously while driving because your breath freezes onto the window. Unless you have really warn clothes, you want cabin heat or electric seats on too.\nMany people in similar climates have remote start and let the gas engines warm up the car so that the ice falls off or is at least easier to scrape off. Some use block heaters too and keep them plugged in all night.\n', '\nThat\'s not just the one problem. Where are they going to get 6 million electric vehicles from in that time? The US produces about 8 million vehicles a year in total, and that\'s not electric, that\'s ALL vehicle types, mainly gas vehicles. Which means it would take not only nearly a year of ALL vehicle production in the US being diverted to just making EV\'s, but also basically a complete stop of production of vehicles for Americans too, which would be a disaster.\nEven if you swap the US for China, it still creates a big global problem of production, because the main point is if those 6 million vehicles are going to Norway, they\'re not going somewhere else, which means a lack of supply elsewhere.\nAnd then there\'s the question of if they even have the grid to handle 6 million EV\'s suddenly charging. The fact that EV\'s actually produce MORE carbon over their lifetime (even though carbon environmentalism is bullshit anyways), they\'re heavier, which means more wear and tear to roads, and they will also need replacement vehicles perpetually, along with maintenance, which I\'m sure they\'re not geared for.\nOh and let\'s also not forget that EV\'s completely destroy a used car market system, because no ones going to buy a 20 year old used car for $15,000+, since the battery replacement itself is going to cost at least that, which means no one is going to even be able to sell their used EV\'s 20 years from now, which means all EV\'s are effectively future junkyard cards.\nJust imagine all the maintenance and replacement parts a car will need over 20 years. Throw in the original purchase price, and the cost of a battery replacement, and a used seller surely isn\'t going to sell it for nothing. Even if they did give it away for nothing without replacing the battery, for the new owner to bear the cost of instead, you\'re still looking at a very high price for what is effectively a fuel tank with extra steps. Which means the used car market is fucking toast in an EV future, which means future young people are going to have some serious problems with no access to affordable transportation. And no, a bus or a train or an electric scooter isn\'t going to fucking cut it. People actually need to carry shit around places. People need to transport whole families at once even.\nAnd then if you consider that all gas taxes would be offset to EV taxes, and no one can afford them, they\'ll be both not generating as much income for taxes, nor using the things that are taxed. Which means even for tax hungry Democrats that poses a huge problem for tax revenue, as there won\'t be much of anything left to squeeze from young people in such an environment, since they won\'t have the capacity to even produce much to be taxed in the first place. Just completely dependent on the state for everything, jobless and broke.\nYou see, the problem with own nothing and be happy, is when a person has nothing, there\'s nothing for the government to take its ""share"" from, which is a huge backfire against Democrats, by their own policies. And of course after they realize they dug themselves into that hole, they\'ll be desperate to tighten their grip as everything slips from their fingers, which means senseless oppression and human suffering. And when you have a bunch of people being oppressed, with nothing to lose, they will either checkout completely or fight back ferociously.\n', '\nVery well articulated!\n', '\nExactly.\nWorldwide, the grid system is barely adequate for current consumption. Had a cold snap in Southern California last night. Transformers were exploiding all over; most were north of 50 years old.\nThe comments about EVs destroying the used car market is spot on. EVs are planned obsolescence.\n', '\n""Own nothing"" is a crock of shit. Somebody has to own something, otherwise there would be no incentive to offer ""subscription"" services for basic goods that used to be something you owned.\nAnd yeah, the used car market would get totally nuked. The battery replacement would kill it. Worse yet since in order for anyone to afford an EV land yacht dealerships would have to offer a long term loan, like 10 years or so. And that would mean a person could quickly wind up upside down on a loan with a vehicle that depreciates to zero very quickly. Granted my POS rusty Camry aint\' worth much after 12 years either but it still runs so it has value. And it will stay on the road for years to come with just basic maintenance and repair. An EV would be bricked due to planned battery obsolescence and a poor used market.\nEver notice how GM, Ford, etc are NOT bitching about the ""future being electric""? It\'s for the reason OP cites, nuking the used market. Automakers, Harley-Davidson, even John Deere are very cognizant about the used market for their products. There is nothing they would love better than to remove the used market so consumers would have to keep buying their overpriced crap and have to take out long term loans to do it.\nI\'ve never bought into this crap about the ""future being electric"", not at all. I have not met anyone or read a single comment anywhere, ever, where someone is dying to get an EV on their own. Yeah, Teslas sell well, but it\'s a niche market for people that are in situations where an EV makes sense for them.\nI really, honestly, truly don\'t see EV\'s ""organically"" supplanting gas cars en masse like with the horse and Model T. It can only work with heavy government mandates. And like OP points out, gas taxes will just migrate to EV\'s instead.\n', ""\nYou'll own nothing and be happy is predicated on large numbers of people gladly bending over to take it up the ass, figuratively of course.\n"", ""\nIt cannot be done.\nBut that's not stopping the Green Goblins.\n"", '\nThis is stupid for Norway to do since they are an oil and gas rich country.\n', '\n^^THIS^^\n', '\nHow about we ban globalist WEF/NWO cocksuckers instead?

I think most Jews are not religious and couldn\'t comment on these things. I hope that we can all be honest with ourselves about how racism hurts our movement, and call it out on PW when we see it. Some of these things are ""social"" problems and not government problems, and at the end of the day it\'s important that we don\'t lose the war for America by focusing on the wrong things at the wrong times.\n', '\nI agree with this, this is one of the most reasonable takes I\'ve seen on this whole dispute. I don\'t really see any effort to give a clear, concise or balanced perspective on this matter. You always hear the anti-Jew narrative here and sometimes some hand-wavy dismissals and insults in response. I would be interested in hearing someone articulate an intelligent response. I don\'t hardly ever feel like I get a nuanced perspective of this topic.\nI say this as someone who has made it clear in the past my dislike of the overgeneralized, black-and-white ""Stormfront""-type of rhetoric flooding on the board in the last two years. I\'m not against critiquing the political/cultural/religious influence of Jews in power (just like any other group), but the surge since 2021 of comments trying to turn any subject into Jews, oversimplifying and reducing all problems in the world to Jews, defending Hitler and saying he ""didn\'t go far enough"", and occasionally even nudging racial/ethnic-based arguments. It all reeks of glowies trying to destroy this board and transform it into the left\'s caricature of Trump supporters.\nWith the emergence of Truth Social and Elon\'s gradual revamping of Twitter, we have a renewed opportunity for outreach again to bring people to the internet\'s biggest community of Trump Supporters and dose them with redpills. That\'s no joke, a University College London study found that r/The_Donald was tied for one of the #1 most effective dispensers of memes on the internet. We could potentially accomplish a lot of good by bringing in more people to Patriots.Win.\nBut there\'s a shift in the tone trying to make this community appear as another one of the internet\'s many isolated corners for fringe lunatics. There\'s an effort to cloud genuine redpills with bluepills. And some here may laugh this off saying ""who cares about optics"", but redpilling as many people as possible is instrumental to securing the change we need in this country, every little bit helps. You need more people redpilled to get more productive action and support in fighting voter fraud, for just one example.\nOn top of that, it\'s demoralizing for those of us here as well. For me personally, it\'s hard to sort out the valid points from the insane narratives. There\'s a gaslighting effect, and I feel like I\'m getting propagandized by glowies and activists. I have trouble developing a clear, concise and stable perspective on these topics. What I originally came to TheDonald for was the refuge of sanity.\nSo, I think getting a more clear, articulate discussion on this subject would be helpful. I\'d like to be able to better distinguish valid arguments about corruption in Jewish culture/history/etc.\n', '\nIt’s not fringe or lunatic to point things out, it’s fringe and lunatic to point things out from a conservative world view, dangerous even. Harmful to marginalized folx.
